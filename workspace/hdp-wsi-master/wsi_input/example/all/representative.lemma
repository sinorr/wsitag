When the splittists wantonly injured and killed ordinary people , did they have the least bit of national feelings and religious piety ?  Since betraying the motherland and the Tibetan people in 1959 , Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom , has been engaging in splittist activities outside the borders .  
Facts have amply proven that the Dalai is the chief representative of the feudal serf owning class in Tibet , the chief ringleader of the national separatists inside and outside the border , the loyal tool of the Western anti-China forces , and the chief culprit splitting the motherland and betraying state and national interests .  
Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom has unceasingly carried out splittist and sabotage activities beyond our borders after betraying the motherland and Tibetan people in 1959 .  He not only has not done a single good deed for the Tibetan people but instead has jeopardized Tibet 's social stability and economic development and even resorted to every trick to thwart aid projects arranged and implemented by the World Bank and other organizations for Tibet and other Tibetan areas in the country .  
During an interview by the press , Tang Yinlong said the Dalai is not just a religious figure , but also the general representative of the serf system in Tibet and a political refugee in the garb of religion who , over a long time , has engaged himself abroad in criminal activities of trying to split up the country and undermining unity among ethnic groups .  
In response to a reporter 's question , the spokesman said : We have taken note that to implement their separatist line in an accelerated way , the Taiwan authorities have taken many steps to cut off the cultural and spiritual links between Taiwan and the mainland .

He emphatically pointed out : His thesis that our party should " always be a requirement in the development of advanced productive force in China - - - - a faithful representative of the fundamental interest of the greatest majority of the Chinese people " means that such a historic mission should be carried out as a dynamic historical process .  
Li Chongfu believes that " always be " and " faithful representative " mean that the party 's line , principles and policies and its overall political guidance formulated and implemented during any time must be adapted to the situation of that time and to local conditions , and they must reflect the law and requirements of the development of productive forces , reflect the wish of the working masses , and be able to promote the development of productive forces and the social progress .

Endeavoring to represent demand of development of advanced productive forces is a solemn mission and sacred responsibility of our party .  Party committees at all levels , every grass-roots party organization , and every party member should work hand in hand to serve as a good " representative " of demand of development of advanced productive forces .  They should consistently maintain the party 's progressiveness and provide a strong political and organizational assurance for our socialist modernization drive .

The proposed three mini links between the two shores represents a decisionmaking mode most representative of characteristics of the new government .  The MAC deems it possible to attain such a " goal " as forging " links " between the two shores through its unilateral , one-sided , and subjective move and without holding negotiations or consultations or even signing an agreement with the other shore .  Obviously , it has treated the other shore as a non-existent " suppositional adversary . "  This unique way of " creating links " is indeed rare in the world .

Read in the light of contemporary trends , Ch'en 's work may seem no longer fresh or original in conception and rather to await further exploration of its potential .

My friends and I do n't think that we 've been ill treated on account of our ROC passport , " says Jackson G . S . Chi , a dentist at the Yelling Dental Clinic who frequently goes abroad to attend international conferences as a representative of our national camping association .

' '  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election .

Even the literary community got into the act , thereby raising the standard for this kind of song .

It is also the reason Taiwanese books are successful in terms of content and set trends for the Chinese reading public around the world .

His life , previously lived amidst books and with quiet time for contemplation , was now continually interrupted by odds and ends .  
In terms of agreement , both sides realize that although democratic government is essentially " representative government , " duly elected representatives and officials are sometimes unable to carry out fully and impartially the duties entrusted to them by the electorate . To correct the insufficiencies of " indirect democracy " one must thus rely on the " direct democracy " of the popular referendum . This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .

In his statement , the SecretaryGeneral laid down his views on an effective human resource management system that could meet the challenges of the changing world situation with an efficient , dynamic and representative international civil service .

In this context , he mentions the amount of time spent in custody prior to the trial ( 381 days ) , out of which a total of nine months were allegedly spent in isolation , and the quality of his legal representation : thus , although he was assigned legal counsel free of charge , his representative " was more of a prosecutor than a lawyer of the defence .

Furthermore , Thailand is convinced that one must also ensure that the United Nations of the twenty-first century is more equitable , representative , democratic , transparent and accountable , allowing for the widest possible participation in all its decision-making and activities and serving the interests of all mankind .

At the same time , we are convinced that genuine and representative democracy , free from foreign interference , must be the key element in preserving peace and observing the basic principles of respect for the fundamental rights of the human person and of economic and social development .  
What we have in mind is striking the necessary balance between the developed and the developing countries , by reinforcing the Council with a number of developing countries that are capable of shouldering such a responsibility and are capable of having the necessary impact at the regional and the international levels , in a manner that would make the Council more representative of international reality and , thereby , much more effective in dealing with international issues .  
Regarding the organization and the direction of the Olympic Movement , a pivotal role is being played by His Excellency Mr . Juan Antonio Samaranch , who , through his policy of engaging in personal contacts and through the prestige which he enjoys throughout the world , within the most varied of political and diplomatic circles , has succeeded in making the Olympic Movement an interlocutor of the most representative and the largest world forum , the United Nations .  
The representative and participatory democratic model has been enriched , contributing to overcoming substantial political and social tensions characteristic of the establishment of a state of law and the perfecting of democratic institutions , through economic and social harmonization and the constant search for a political consensus .

The representative replied that the mechanisms were focal points for rural development , education and popular participation , a few committees dealing with specific issues , various other connections at the societal and international levels and that the National Secretariat was represented in seven out of the nine provinces of the country .  
The representative stressed that , in order to add a gender dimension to all government policies , the current Government assumed that discrimination against women was not expressed through occasional or partial situations , but rather was systematic and hence required structural and cultural changes .  
As to the financial resources , the representative replied that the process of providing government aid would be a gradual one ; by gradually transforming the current educational system , primary education would become government aided , and university and other forms of tertiary education would be on a cost-sharing basis .  
Responding to questions regarding health care plans for prostitutes , the representative emphasized that the authorities focused on the health aspect and instituted mandatory medical visits for prostitutes in order to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) / acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .  
The representative stated that numerous studies showed the extent to which informal sector had contributed to the national economy , and it was also proved that women 's contribution to the informal sector could reduce the negative effects of the structural adjustment plan .  
In reply to concerns raised by the Committee relating to the real force of this provision , the representative stated that , effectively , the Constitution of Peru provided that international treaties concluded by Peru formed part of municipal law , and , accordingly , article 2 , which established that everybody is equal and can not be discriminated against by reason of sex , was part of the law of the land .  
Asked about the specific content of the equality clause in the National Population Law and whether recourse was available in the event that national equality legislation was not applied at the local level , the representative said that the National Population Law established equality between men and women where family planning was concerned and provided recourse to courts .

Responding to a question on national machinery for the coordination of policies dealing with women and on its responsibilities , status and authority , the representative , referring to the fourth periodic report , informed members of the Committee that such machinery , with mandates for women , the family and children , had been established within federal , regional and local governments and that it cooperated with public organizations .  
Replying to a question on the role of women in economic and social decision-making and the integration of their concerns into economic and social planning , the representative , referring to the fourth periodic report , informed the Committee that women in the Russian Federation were not adequately represented at the decision-making level .  
In her answer to the question concerning measures taken by her Government to ensure that the level of women 's representation in public life did not decline , particularly in rural areas , the representative said that legislation in the Russian Federation contained no discriminatory rules limiting the participation of women in the political life of the country .  
In introducing the report , the representative pointed out that the priorities set out in the White Paper to the Parliament ( Storting ) in the spring of 1993 included an active child-care policy with a focus on shared family responsibilities between the parents , renewed efforts to reach the goal of equal pay , and more effective actions against the abuse of women and sexual violence .  
The representative replied that the third periodic report , which noted the Ombudsman 's request for a more effective affirmative action policy , explained that the view of the Gender Equality Ombudsman was that existing affirmative action measures should either be strengthened to gain proper effect , or abolished altogether , as in her opinion the existing arrangements served to give the public unrealistic notions of women 's opportunities in the labour market . 
One representative drew attention to the fact that , increasingly , national courts were enforcing international legal instruments for punishing perpetrators of international crimes and that it should , therefore , not be felt that the granting of universal jurisdiction to national courts and judicial cooperation among States for the purpose of the administration of justice would no longer be valid after the establishment of the Court .  
Another representative noted that the draft statute lacked clarity in that there was no indication as to whether that complementary relationship would be a hierarchical type of relationship , or whether the international criminal court would be given an advisory role vis - - vis national courts or even be competent to vary the decisions of the latter in application of international law .  
Another representative also expressed her preference for a permanent body working on a full-time basis , given the nature , complexity and specific activities of the Court as well as the increasing number of cases that might come under its jurisdiction , but nevertheless supported a more flexible solution , bearing in mind the possible economic and practical difficulties involved .  
Noting that there was still disagreement among States as to whether the Security Council was authorized to set up a compulsory jurisdiction under the Charter and that , with respect to the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , some States had expressed reservations to that effect , another representative expressed doubts as to whether it was wise to base the statute on such a controversial assumption .  
One representative expressed surprise at the absence of any reference in article 33 to other sources of substantive international law , and suggested that it be redrafted to broaden the range of applicable rules , so that over and above the statute , the Court could apply the draft Code , treaties relating to certain specific crimes , principles and rules of international law , the relevant acts of international organizations and , if necessary , any rule of national law .  
Another representative pointed out that the idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law as regards the constituent elements of crimes and the penalties to be imposed was worth considering , although the manner in which that was effected would require careful study .  
Another representative , after pointing out that the draft statute contained no provisions on statutory limitations or on their non-applicability , observed that , if a permanent international criminal court was to become a reality , the Court 's jurisdiction ratione temporis would have to be determined in order to preserve the principle of legal safety . 
One representative expressed the view that , from the standpoint of terminology , it would be advisable to highlight the difference between contiguous or adjacent and successive watercourses , as each system had its own specific features , and that a particular rule could not be assumed to be applicable to both types of watercourses .  
In the view of the same representative , by including the word " normally " the Commission had made it clear that the burden of proof lay upon States which wanted to apply the current draft articles to regulate rivers not flowing into a common terminus on the ground that there existed a physical relationship and a unitary whole for the major part of the length of the watercourses .  
One representative stated that , according to paragraph ( 2 ) of the commentary to draft article 3 , the Commission expressly recognized that optimal utilization , protection and development of a specific international watercourse were best achieved through an agreement tailored to the characteristics of that watercourse and to the needs of the States concerned .  
One representative , while questioning the ability of the draft articles to provide adequate environmental protection for international watercourses , wondered in particular whether the emphasis on optimal utilization did not overshadow the objective of leaving a watercourse in a pristine state .  
One representative considered that , while making the establishment of a fact finding commission compulsory represented a step forward , the optional character of recourse to conciliation constituted a step backward with respect to the conventions on codification concluded in recent decades .  266 .  Another representative was of the view that a rule for a compulsory fact-finding commission comprising three members reflected the need for a comprehensive and compulsory dispute settlement procedure .  
The project takes into account UNEP expertise for environmental law and UNDP country coordinating capacity ; all national level programmes will be implemented under the supervision of the UNDP resident representative , with UNEP acting as technical adviser .  
One representative raised the question of whether the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was sufficiently effective to safeguard individual women against gender discrimination and called for the endorsement of the proposal for an optional protocol , as agreed upon at the European regional preparatory meeting .

A representative of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) emphasized that violence against women was a major public health issue , since it led to psychological trauma , depression , substance abuse , injuries , sexually transmitted diseases , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , suicide and death ; however , the victims rarely received rehabilitative care , or the compensation received by the victims of other injury-causing trauma .  
Invites the international community to continue to lend its political , diplomatic , material and financial support to end the violence , to help the Government of Burundi to find a lasting solution to the political and ethnic tensions and to create conditions to favour the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons and , in this context , requests the Secretary-General to strengthen the office of his special representative in Bujumbura ;

Helena for administrative reasons , was not included in the Committee 's agenda .  
The representative of ECLAC stated that at present , INSTRAW was experiencing a turning point , therefore its cooperation with the regional commissions required some analysis so that INSTRAW could significantly contribute to the regional work that was taking place ; by the same token , the regional commissions could provide support to INSTRAW 's activities , based on their knowledge of their specific regional conditions , and the regional institutions dealing with the relevant subjects .  
Furthermore , the representative of DDSMS stated that the current financial situation of INSTRAW demanded that major efforts be made by the Acting Director , with the assistance of the Board members , to ensure that the level of contribution for research and training in 1995 and succeeding years be substantially increased .  
The representative of Iraq denies that his country refused to sign the minutes of the most recent meeting of the tripartite committee , which was held at Geneva on 7 April 1995 , and claims that none of the parties signed the document when Kuwait insisted on imposing political conditions that bore no relation to the humanitarian issue on which the meeting had been convened ;  
By democratization , I mean a process by which an authoritarian society becomes increasingly participatory through such mechanisms as periodic elections to representative bodies , the accountability of public officials , a transparent public administration , an independent judiciary and a free press .  
Following the massive crimes in western Slavonia in May 1995 committed by the Croatian forces , which resulted in territory cleansed of Serbs , Croatia is now resorting to the same method in the Krajina , namely , the media and international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations representative are denied access to the area before all incriminating traces are removed .

In closing , let me say that my delegation looks forward to close collaboration with you , Sir , and all other members over the next year to advance a collective vision of a truly representative , effective and united United Nations for the twenty-first century .  
Firmly and consistently committed to the course of democratic development pursued by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan , Mr . Emomali Rakhmonov , the Government of my country promotes the involvement of the broad mass of the population in social , political and economic reform processes through such mechanisms as referendums , national elections to representative bodies , renovation of the judicial system and every possible encouragement of openness .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
It is rather incongruous that the same forces that are at the forefront of the effort to establish democratic institutions and representative governments in certain parts of the world are also engaged in an enterprise which , if successful , is calculated to destroy the free and democratic way of life in the eastern Caribbean .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
New Zealand will make that commitment , because we are committed to building a strengthened and effective United Nations that is ready and able to tackle the challenges that lie ahead , and a United Nations system that is more internationally democratic and more representative of the world we live in as the century draws to a close .

I am concerned about the imprudent behaviour of the south Korean representative , as it will lead to intensified confrontation between the north and the south of Korea and have a negative effect on international peace and security as a whole .  
To avoid alarmist or misleading awareness campaigns , they need reliable and representative information - e.g . , on various forest types ( boreal , temperate , tropical , wet , dry , natural , plantations , monocultures ) ; ( e ) The general public and media . 
Experience seems to recommend , however , on the one hand , the systematic designation , for all operations of whatever size , of a special representative of the Secretary-General having complete authority over the various components of the operation and , on the other hand , at least for peace-restoration and conflict-moderation operations , which almost inextricably link military tasks ( even including combat ) with negotiation and humanitarian aid activities , an integrated structure involving close cooperation between civilians and military personnel at all levels of command , including logistics .  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1996 or early 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative government and to freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;

We note that the Permanent Representative of Lebanon , as reflected in document S / 1996 / 280 , requested that the Council convene an urgent meeting on the afternoon of Sunday , 14 April , given the grave developments in his country .  Speaking during the debate on Palestine held earlier today , the Malaysian representative referred to the worsening situation in the Middle East .

It will be seen that the information contained in the Greek Cypriot representative 's aforementioned letter is deliberately wrong and is designed to mislead the world public opinion by exploiting such an unfortunate incident .  
Noticing that the 14-million eligible voters among the 21.3-million Republic of China citizens living in Taiwan , Penghu ( Pescadores ) , Kinmen ( Quemoy ) and Matsu area have , through universal , equal and direct suffrage and secret balloting , elected their first popularly elected president on 23 March 1996 as their genuine representative in the international community ,  
ANCELL , the representative of the Province of Santa Cruz ( Argentina ) in the National Congress of Argentina and a descendant of the native people of the Malvinas , said that territorial conquests by force had lost their currency and that the Committee had performed an outstanding task in liberating territories and returning them to their rightful owners .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
It was also suggested to include in the statute such specific grounds for the excusing and disqualification of judges as : that the judge is the injured party or a relative of the accused or of the injured party , or a national of a complainant State or of a State of which the accused is a national , or that the judge has acted as a witness , representative , counsel , public prosecutor or judge at the national level in the case involving the accused .  
In this regard , on Friday , 23 August , the Government published a statement in which it invites the entire international community , starting with Amnesty International , to immediately begin investigations of this monstrous allegation by the representative of Amnesty International in Burundi .  Today I received a copy of a message sent by the Government of Burundi to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , inviting them to increase the number of human rights observers , since the current Government ,  
By a letter dated 23 July 1996 ( A / 51 / 226-S / 1996 / 595 ) , the representative of Ukraine transmitted to the Secretary-General an aide-m \ x { 5e66 } oire on the position of Ukraine on the problems of implementation of the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council , in which it is stated , inter alia , that Ukraine has paid a high price for strict and consistent implementation of the sanctions .  
By a note verbale dated 30 August 1996 ( A / 51 / 330-S / 1996 / 721 and Corr . 1 ) , the representative of Bulgaria transmitted to the Secretary-General a national communication on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 50 / 58 E , in which it is pointed out , inter alia , that , by virtue of its geographic location and the outward nature of its economy , Bulgaria has been extremely vulnerable to the negative side effects of the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
The political leadership now has the opportunity to ensure that , in particular through the functioning of common institutions at the national level , all three communities can work towards the consolidation of a sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law , respect for the human rights of all peoples and the development of a representative democracy .  
Organizations of civil society are often flexible , responsive , representative and open to wide participation ; many function at grass-roots level and provide vital opportunities for two-way communication with local communities .  
That procedure is established in the collective agreements , with a view to protecting the worker ( requiring him to appear before a Disciplinary Council consisting of an equal number of the employer 's and workers ' representatives , and according him the right to present his defence in a written statement and to be assisted at the Disciplinary Council by a worker of his choice or by a representative of his trade union , and by lawyers ) .  
Mr . SERIWA ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that his delegation supported the statement on the question of ageing made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China . Despite the encouraging growth in the global economy , economic and social conditions in many developing countries , particularly in Africa , were still disturbing , owing to a large number of external factors such as an increased debt-burden .  
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .  
With regard to the requirement for a certified copy of the decision opening the foreign proceeding , the concern was expressed that the use of such an expression might exclude those cases in which the foreign representative was appointed , or the proceedings were commenced , without an actual decision or order of the court ( e.g . , by right pursuant to statutory authority , such as in a debtor-initiated voluntary proceeding ) .  
While agreeing with the principle that a foreign representative should be given the right to commence actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to creditors ( sometimes referred to as Paulian actions ) , the Working Group considered that it would be preferable to delete the reference to them in subparagraph ( b ) ( v ) .  
The attainment of that objective required good governance , which could be defined as government that was honest , open and equitable , that provided public institutions which were stable , responsive and reliable and that was transparent , representative , accountable and restrained .  
We are hopeful that the coming consultations will overcome these obstacles and embody the political will expressed by the leaders of the world during the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as their affirmation that the expansion of the Security Council is a basic condition for making its membership more representative and its working methods more transparent .  
Our ultimate objective in pursuing these reforms is to bring about a democratic , representative , dynamic and revitalized Security Council which will be more relevant to the common problems we all face .  
My delegation believes that our proposals on the size of the permanent membership and on the size and geographical composition of the non-permanent membership are a material and proper approach to the reform of the Security Council if the Council is to continue to have credibility as an institution which is representative of the international community as a whole and which therefore has the legal and moral authority to act on its behalf .

To denying , in countries that do not already do so and in accordance with the fundamental principles of their legal systems , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a Member State to any public official or elected representative of another country ;  
His delegation welcomed the comprehensive report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , prepared by the Secretary-General 's expert , and supported her proposal that a special representative on the subject should be appointed .  
To criminalize in an effective manner acts of bribery in international commercial transactions of any public official or elected representative , by any private or public corporation or individual , taking action where appropriate in a coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;  
The offer , promise or giving of any payment , gift or other advantage , directly or indirectly , by any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from a State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;

Refuting the so-called reliable sources of the Special Rapporteur as being linked to other States or in the pay of the United States secret services , the representative of Iraq said that the accusations concerning the violation of the political and civil rights of the Iraqi population by means of laws imposing cruel and inhuman penalties , which those sources had reported , were totally groundless since those laws had been repealed , as the Centre for Human Rights and other international bodies could confirm .  
The representative of Norway , a country with which Burundi had excellent cooperative relations , had , at a previous meeting , said that the coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at that had taken place in Burundi in 1995 had not improved the security or human rights situation but , on the contrary , had exacerbated the suffering of the people .  
The representative of Ireland , speaking for the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
The offer , promise or giving of any payment , gift or other advantage , directly or indirectly , by any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from a State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;

The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern that the Trade and Development Report 's forecast of slow world economic growth reflected the effects of the unequal access of developing countries to external lending and FDI .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
The representative of Australia complimented the secretariat on its analysis of factors contributing to dynamic growth in East Asia and noted that the Trade and Development Report 1996 pointed to the important role in the growth of economies in the region played by the rapid expansion of exports of labour _ intensive manufactures to major developed countries . 
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election and take part freely in a representative Government , and to freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
The representative of the European Commission said that it was likely that the number of transborder RBPs ( particularly cartels , abuses of dominance and mergers having international effects ) had increased in proportion with the considerable growth in international trade , in foreign direct investment , and in the size and number of transnational corporations .  
PRANDLER ( Hungary ) said that the word " ecosystems " should be defined in article 2 and that article 20 could be further strengthened by including three additional elements , namely : the prevention , reduction and control of pollution ; the need for ecologically sound and rational water management , conservation of water resources ( including freshwater systems ) and environmental protection ; and the conservation and , where necessary , the regeneration of the ecosystems of international watercourses , as already proposed by the Venezuelan representative with the support of others .  
The offer , promise or giving of any payment , gift or other advantage , directly or indirectly , by any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from a State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
The soliciting , demanding , accepting or receiving , directly or indirectly , by any public official or elected representative of a State from any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from another country of any payment , gift or other advantage , as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country , and to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
In this context , as requested in the draft resolution , the Special Mission would continue its efforts to facilitate national reconciliation and reconstruction in Afghanistan , in particular by mediating an end to the conflict and facilitating the implementation of a peaceful settlement by promoting a fully representative and broad-based transitional government which could control the national security force and create conditions for free and fair elections leading to a representative national Government .  
His delegation , which fully associated itself with the views expressed at a previous meeting by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union , was of the view that the court , though closely linked to the United Nations , should be an independent international institution established by a multilateral treaty .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on the respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
The world community must send a clear signal to the warring parties immediately to halt all hostilities , refrain from the use of force , set aside their differences and engage in political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation , a lasting political settlement to the conflict and the establishment of a completely representative and broad-based transitional Government of national unity .  
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under those objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
It was proposed that , within the context of article 15 ( 1 ) , the powers of the foreign representative or other person designated by the court should be limited to measures destined to preserve three categories of assets : perishable assets , assets susceptible of devaluation and assets otherwise in jeopardy , such as where there was an imminent danger of their being concealed or dissipated .  
The Commission , however , decided that the automatic stay should cover not only execution of claims but also the individual actions and proceedings conducted prior to execution ; that was considered necessary to allow the foreign representative the necessary temporary respite to organize the affairs of the debtor without having to participate in possibly numerous actions against the debtor .  
The Commission considered the question whether the Model Provisions should expressly provide that a foreign representative had procedural " standing " ( a concept in some procedural systems referred to by expressions such as " active procedural legitimation " , " active legitimation " or " legitimation " ) to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors ( such actions were sometimes referred to as " Paulian actions " ) .  
It was said that , if such standing was to be conferred on the foreign representative , it should extend only to actions that were available to the local insolvency administrator in the context of an insolvency proceeding opened in the enacting State ; care should be taken to avoid creating an impression that the foreign representative was equated with individual creditors , who under many legal systems had a right to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors .  
Emphasizing the importance of the democratic , efficient , transparent and representative governing structures of the United Nations Environment Programme , with a complementary , specific and distinct role and mandate for each of their components ,  
Considering the increased cooperation we have witnessed during the past year in support of Latin American and Caribbean Member States in the field of designing policies on social development including the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development on economic integration and on trends in the globalization process , our delegations are in favour of a further broadening and deepening of the mutual supporting activities between ECLAC and the Latin American Economic System , as expressed this morning by the representative of Peru .  
Mr . Yakovlev ( Russian Federation ) ( interpretation from Russian ) : The purposes set out in the statutes of the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) to unite parliamentarians to secure the broad participation of States in the strengthening of international peace and security , in the firm establishment of representative institutions and in the defence of human rights are largely consonant with the aspirations of the United Nations .  
Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy representative of its Group in that most important organ and to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy : the promotion of human rights , respect for international humanitarian law , respect for the principle of non-intervention , total compliance with the prohibition of the use of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal means of implementing the right of peoples to self-determination .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
In this context , the European Union wishes to express very warm thanks to Mr . Vranitzky , the personal representative of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office , for his remarkable efforts in the field and within international organizations to enable parliamentary elections to be held in acceptable conditions on 29 June 1997 .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
We must see to it that these trends are strengthened and that the way is cleared for specific , tangible steps that would make it possible to move to address in practical terms the question of the cessation of the armed conflict and the start of a political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation and the establishment in Afghanistan of a broad-based , fully representative government .  
The elimination of our armed forces and the demilitarization of our society have fostered a broad , pluralistic , representative system in the form of a democratic and social state of law , which is the legal structure representing the will for peace , conciliation and harmonious coexistence Costa Ricans have chosen .  
We welcome you as a high-ranking official and a professional of established authority , as well as a representative of Ukraine , a country with which Belarus maintains close and friendly relations and which is making a valuable contribution to international cooperation within the framework of the United Nations .  
The decision also served as a basis for an appeal from the Federation Council to legislative ( representative ) and executive organs of State power of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation that the situation regarding the provision of supplies and equipment to the Russian penal system which had deteriorated markedly in recent years ; the conditions of detention in remand centres ( sizos ) under the control of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MVD ) constituted flagrant violations of human rights and of the law and the international obligations of the Russian Federation .  
Independent , speedy and effective legal and / or administrative procedures for seeking redress , containing such features as fast-tracking for cases where the complainant is terminally ill , investigatory powers to address systemic cases of discrimination in policies and procedures , ability to bring cases under pseudonym and representative complaints , including the possibility of public interest organizations bringing cases on behalf of people living with HIV / AIDS ;  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
The Office 's special programmes and projects shall consist of specialized activities concerning , inter alia , displaced persons , the rights of women , the rights of children and adolescents , the penal and prison systems , indigenous communities , disabled persons and other sectors in need of special protection .  22 .  The representative of the National Observatory for Human Rights of Algeria advised that the Observatory was based on the principle of institutional and cultural pluralism .  
The representative of the National Commission on Human Rights of Cameroon stated that at the regional level , other African national human rights institutions had entrusted Cameroon 's National Commission with the task of planning , preparing and hosting the first African Regional Conference of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights with the objective , among others , of encouraging States in the region to create their own national institutions ( see also paras .  25 _ 27 ) .  
However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .  
It was pointed out that many if not all national procedural laws contemplated cases where a party ( the foreign representative in the current provision ) who demonstrated a legal interest in the outcome of a dispute between two other parties was permitted by the court deciding the dispute to be heard in the proceedings .  
However , the view was also expressed that , for those legal systems where the words " to intervene " were not well understood , those words might be given a different interpretation , and in particular that they might carry the meaning that the foreign representative might substitute for the debtor in judicial actions .  
The representative explained that the definition of child sex tourism as presently worded was too broad and too vague and thus presented difficulties as regards its application at the national legislative level , particularly in her country which provided for the direct application of international standards .  
The representative of Uruguay supported by the observer for Costa Rica , stressed the importance of preventive measures and international cooperation in eradicating basic problems such as socio _ economic ones , which made children more vulnerable to such practices . 
First of all , in the view of ACC members , the report does not take sufficient account of the broad variety of NGOs , whose roles , operational procedures and financial requirements are quite different , ranging from large international organizations to national support NGOs and representative peoples ' organizations .  
They also try to ensure that the guidelines include the main criteria to be fulfilled by NGOs applying for consultative status , such as being of a representative character and having a recognized standing , as well as having an established record in areas falling within the competence of a given agency .  
The continued preference of some of the warring Afghan parties for the military option , and their intransigence and lack of responsiveness to the strenuous efforts of the special representative to achieve a comprehensive settlement , confirm the need to develop the efforts currently being made by the United Nations and to direct these efforts to more practical steps leading to the creation of the climate necessary for the implementation of the proposals made to date and of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject .  
Despite strenuous diplomatic efforts , in particular by the Secretary-General and his special representative , Mr . Nobert Holl , to broker a ceasefire and engage the warring parties in a peace process , the fighting has been raging unabated , with even greater intensity in recent months . 
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Consequently , it is the individual concerned , the citizen , who is fully entitled , directly or indirectly , to choose those who exercise the governmental , representative or legislative function , and who renews or withdraws his trust _ or rather his delegation of authority _ at predetermined intervals and in accordance with rules that protect his freedom of choice and punish any attempt to vitiate or divert it .  
On anti _ personnel landmines , we have heard a rather dramatic reference made in the statement of the distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal and the representative of Kenya to the importance of the issue in some regions , and the importance of rapid and effective humanitarian action , but also I think that the significant reflection of these and other statements is that the issue is an issue of importance for the Conference on Disarmament and that we await a pronouncement in this regard .  
When the Human Rights Committee considered France 's report in 1983 , an extremely instructive debate took place on the validity of the reservations made by France to article 4 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 35 The expert from the German Democratic Republic asserted that France had confirmed that reservations to article 4 were permissible , in response to which the representative of France said that the reservations were limited to paragraph 1 of that article . 
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under these objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
The representative informed the Committee that plans now in place to allow pregnant teenagers to continue their education included working with fathers as appropriate and the provision of functional literacy skills programmes , skills training , parenting classes and family life education , which involved family planning and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) education . 
In view of the current situation in Haiti , so ably described today by the representative of Haiti , we can not but conclude that the primary objective of UNSMIH 's mandate has not yet been fully accomplished , and that sustained international assistance remains essential .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc . 
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc .  3 .  Recommendations to Governments :  
In the broad context of the complicated general situation in Africa , the Security Council decided to devote special attention to the situation in the Republic of Sierra Leone , as part of the international community 's effort over the past three years through the United Nations , in coordination with the Organization of African Unity , subregional organizations and the Governments of the region to restore pluralistic and representative democracy , and promote respect for human rights and peace and national reconciliation in that country . 
With its unique nature , its special mandate and its open-ended composition it could contribute greatly to the process of restructuring the Organization , giving an enhanced role to the General Assembly as the most representative body and increasing the representativeness of the Security Council by expanding the participation of developing countries , in conformity with the principle of sovereign equality as well as equitable geographical representation .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
In situations where political mediation , peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian relief are carried out simultaneously , the special representative of the Secretary-General helps secure a cohesive overall approach by ensuring that activities are mutually reinforcing and that the respective tasks to be performed are clearly defined .  
While there was no simple solution to pursuing development goals in an increasingly competitive and globalized world and even though economic growth was not automatic , notable strides had been made by those who embraced credible macro-economic settings ; those who addressed the social dimension of development in tandem with the pursuit of economic growth ; those who fostered domestic private sector development ; and those who pursued representative , open and accountable governance .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
In his reports to the Commission and the General Assembly , the representative has provided information on the magnitude of internal displacement worldwide , has identified specific needs of the internally displaced for protection and assistance , including highlighting the particular problems faced by women and children , has assessed the extent to which those needs are being met under existing normative and institutional frameworks and has reported in detail on specific country situations that he , through his country visits , has studied first-hand .  
It is symbolic that a representative of a renewed democracy which is living through a period of fundamental social , economic and political reforms , has become President of the General Assembly at a time when the issue of United Nations reform tops its agenda .  
Many a representative has drawn attention to the continued and widespread growth of the global economy as we move towards the close of the century and to the broadening of the reach of economic growth in developing countries to include an increasing number of low-income countries .  
The Dominican Republic attaches special importance to the ongoing reform process , given that it is capable , while respecting the principles and purposes that gave birth to the Organization , of ensuring a more democratic , transparent , representative and efficient system capable of facing the current challenges , especially those of peace and the problems of poverty that affect the peoples of the world .  
Each must agree to subordinate its individual decision and discretion to a global political will , manifested through truly democratic and representative organs of the United Nations , reflecting the authentic judgement of the world community of States .  
In the United States , we have raised the minimum wage , expanded tax credits for working families and reduced the federal deficit , all of which provide the basis for investment , growth and job creation .  The lesson we have learned is that a flexible job market that facilitates mobility , an economy open to competition and sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a Government that is representative , transparent and accountable , all contribute to the creation of jobs .  
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
My delegation wishes to emphasize that current realities of the post-cold-war era the diffusion of political , economic and military power among diverse regions of the world require that decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security be made in a more representative and democratic manner , mindful of the sovereign equality of all States .  
In conclusion , my delegation pledges its support to you , Mr . President , including in your capacity as Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group , to take our work forward in a practical and constructive manner towards an outcome which will result in an expanded , more representative , more transparent Security Council , better equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century .  
I am especially pleased that the General Assembly has elected to this very responsible function a very competent representative from Ukraine , a friendly country with which the Republic of Macedonia is developing successful cooperation .

As a representative of national organizations which remained in place after international organizations had completed their work , the Federation trusted that more governments would take steps to create an environment conducive to a constructive dialogue and effective cooperation , so that non-governmental organizations could function effectively . 
My delegation is delighted to see the Chair of the CD occupied by a representative of Romania , a country with which Poland is linked by traditional bonds of friendship , which _ as confirmed during the recent visit of the President of Romania , Emil Constantinescu , to Warsaw _ is firmly based on shared values and aspirations .

The representative of Ireland , speaking on behalf of the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
I am delighted to see you in the Chair of this distinguished assembly , as the representative of a country with which Italy has maintained , through centuries , deep relations of cooperation and cultural exchanges of which I , myself , had the privilege , in a previous professional experience , to be a witness and a promoter . 
The representative of the Netherlands also expressed the view that the consolidated text was acceptable as a bare minimum , and that , after resolving the remaining issue , it should be adopted by the Working Group without substantial debate and changes .  
With regard to new article W , the representative of Germany stated that his delegation placed mental brackets on the adoption by consensus of new article W . His delegation reserved its final position with the understanding that either lawfully and openly or from a legitimate source would be removed from the present wording . 
The representative of the Netherlands felt that a provision for resource mobilization as proposed by the representative of South Africa should not include a reference to the single general domestic legislation clause , because it would be redundant and might set a bad precedent for the inclusion of similar restrictions in other provisions contained in the consolidated text .  
The representative of the United Kingdom found the original proposal of the representative of South Africa for a new article W acceptable to his delegation , because it maintained the status quo ( i.e . funding of human rights defenders being subject to national legislation consistent with applicable international law ) .

Mr . Al-Humaimidi ( Iraq ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the comments made by the United States representative following the introduction of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq had been motivated by that countrys desire to prevent the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq , despite Iraqs full compliance with the relevant Security Council resolution and contrary to the views of most members of the international community .

These facts have not been enough to persuade the representative of the United States of America to desist from using irresponsible methods to prevent thousands of sick children , older persons and women from obtaining the medicines they need to alleviate the suffering brought on by the diseases they have contracted as a result of the maintenance of the unjust embargo against Iraq , which has taken on a political and biased character and which has the goal of undermining the national political regime in Iraq .

While there is no commonly accepted definition of what good governance , or " capable " government , means in operational terms , at the very least it signifies the existence of a stable and relatively open and transparent political framework that is representative of , and responsive to , the will of the people .  
I should like to call your attention to the fact that , during the initial 180-day period the Memorandum of Understanding has been in effect , the representative of the United States of America in the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) has deliberately obstructed and delayed the processing of contracts in the Committee for odious political reasons inimical to the people of Iraq .

Mr . OUCH ( Cambodia ) said that he fully supported the statement made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China .

While other agencies had long faced problems in choosing legitimate or representative partners in the private sector , those partners were usually non-profit bodies , whereas working on operational projects with profit-seeking partners was clearly more problematic ; association with the United Nations could be interpreted as giving an unfair commercial advantage over its competitors , national and international .

When the splittists wantonly injured and killed ordinary people , did they have the least bit of national feelings and religious piety ?  Since betraying the motherland and the Tibetan people in 1959 , Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom , has been engaging in splittist activities outside the borders .

Endeavoring to represent demand of development of advanced productive forces is a solemn mission and sacred responsibility of our party .  Party committees at all levels , every grass-roots party organization , and every party member should work hand in hand to serve as a good " representative " of demand of development of advanced productive forces .  They should consistently maintain the party 's progressiveness and provide a strong political and organizational assurance for our socialist modernization drive .

Read in the light of contemporary trends , Ch'en 's work may seem no longer fresh or original in conception and rather to await further exploration of its potential .

Chi , a dentist at the Yelling Dental Clinic who frequently goes abroad to attend international conferences as a representative of our national camping association .

' '  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election .

The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .

"

Even the literary community got into the act , thereby raising the standard for this kind of song .

The rebellious nature of his books brings to mind Refusing to Take the Joint Entrance Exam , which was written by Wu Hsiang-hui in Taiwan two decades earlier .

It is also the reason Taiwanese books are successful in terms of content and set trends for the Chinese reading public around the world .  
Thinking back on his career as a local official , Lin says that as the representative of the county executive and spokesperson for the county government , he was tied down by countless details and small tasks . He would often be awakened by phone calls in the middle of the night-having just got to sleep after yet another busy day . His life , previously lived amidst books and with quiet time for contemplation , was now continually interrupted by odds and ends .  
In terms of agreement , both sides realize that although democratic government is essentially " representative government , " duly elected representatives and officials are sometimes unable to carry out fully and impartially the duties entrusted to them by the electorate .

This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .

Furthermore , Thailand is convinced that one must also ensure that the United Nations of the twenty-first century is more equitable , representative , democratic , transparent and accountable , allowing for the widest possible participation in all its decision-making and activities and serving the interests of all mankind .

At the same time , we are convinced that genuine and representative democracy , free from foreign interference , must be the key element in preserving peace and observing the basic principles of respect for the fundamental rights of the human person and of economic and social development .  
What we have in mind is striking the necessary balance between the developed and the developing countries , by reinforcing the Council with a number of developing countries that are capable of shouldering such a responsibility and are capable of having the necessary impact at the regional and the international levels , in a manner that would make the Council more representative of international reality and , thereby , much more effective in dealing with international issues .  
Regarding the organization and the direction of the Olympic Movement , a pivotal role is being played by His Excellency Mr .

The desire expressed by the Members of the United Nations to enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council will become reality if we make the Council as representative an organ as possible , reflecting the universal character of the United Nations and including within it the greatest possible variety of interests and views , and if we adopt , as guiding principles to that end , those of the sovereign equality of States and of equitable geographical distribution , as provided in the Charter .  
At that size , the Council 's representative character would be enhanced , while at the same time the necessary ability for prompt , effective and continuous action , as required by the Charter , would be preserved .

The representative stressed that , in order to add a gender dimension to all government policies , the current Government assumed that discrimination against women was not expressed through occasional or partial situations , but rather was systematic and hence required structural and cultural changes .  
As to the financial resources , the representative replied that the process of providing government aid would be a gradual one ; by gradually transforming the current educational system , primary education would become government aided , and university and other forms of tertiary education would be on a cost-sharing basis .

Asked about the specific content of the equality clause in the National Population Law and whether recourse was available in the event that national equality legislation was not applied at the local level , the representative said that the National Population Law established equality between men and women where family planning was concerned and provided recourse to courts .

Responding to a question on national machinery for the coordination of policies dealing with women and on its responsibilities , status and authority , the representative , referring to the fourth periodic report , informed members of the Committee that such machinery , with mandates for women , the family and children , had been established within federal , regional and local governments and that it cooperated with public organizations .  
Replying to a question on the role of women in economic and social decision-making and the integration of their concerns into economic and social planning , the representative , referring to the fourth periodic report , informed the Committee that women in the Russian Federation were not adequately represented at the decision-making level .  
In her answer to the question concerning measures taken by her Government to ensure that the level of women 's representation in public life did not decline , particularly in rural areas , the representative said that legislation in the Russian Federation contained no discriminatory rules limiting the participation of women in the political life of the country .  
In introducing the report , the representative pointed out that the priorities set out in the White Paper to the Parliament ( Storting ) in the spring of 1993 included an active child-care policy with a focus on shared family responsibilities between the parents , renewed efforts to reach the goal of equal pay , and more effective actions against the abuse of women and sexual violence .  
The representative replied that the third periodic report , which noted the Ombudsman 's request for a more effective affirmative action policy , explained that the view of the Gender Equality Ombudsman was that existing affirmative action measures should either be strengthened to gain proper effect , or abolished altogether , as in her opinion the existing arrangements served to give the public unrealistic notions of women 's opportunities in the labour market . 
One representative drew attention to the fact that , increasingly , national courts were enforcing international legal instruments for punishing perpetrators of international crimes and that it should , therefore , not be felt that the granting of universal jurisdiction to national courts and judicial cooperation among States for the purpose of the administration of justice would no longer be valid after the establishment of the Court .  
Another representative noted that the draft statute lacked clarity in that there was no indication as to whether that complementary relationship would be a hierarchical type of relationship , or whether the international criminal court would be given an advisory role vis - - vis national courts or even be competent to vary the decisions of the latter in application of international law .  
Another representative also expressed her preference for a permanent body working on a full-time basis , given the nature , complexity and specific activities of the Court as well as the increasing number of cases that might come under its jurisdiction , but nevertheless supported a more flexible solution , bearing in mind the possible economic and practical difficulties involved .  
Noting that there was still disagreement among States as to whether the Security Council was authorized to set up a compulsory jurisdiction under the Charter and that , with respect to the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , some States had expressed reservations to that effect , another representative expressed doubts as to whether it was wise to base the statute on such a controversial assumption .  
One representative expressed surprise at the absence of any reference in article 33 to other sources of substantive international law , and suggested that it be redrafted to broaden the range of applicable rules , so that over and above the statute , the Court could apply the draft Code , treaties relating to certain specific crimes , principles and rules of international law , the relevant acts of international organizations and , if necessary , any rule of national law .  
Another representative pointed out that the idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law as regards the constituent elements of crimes and the penalties to be imposed was worth considering , although the manner in which that was effected would require careful study .  
Another representative , after pointing out that the draft statute contained no provisions on statutory limitations or on their non-applicability , observed that , if a permanent international criminal court was to become a reality , the Court 's jurisdiction ratione temporis would have to be determined in order to preserve the principle of legal safety . 
One representative expressed the view that , from the standpoint of terminology , it would be advisable to highlight the difference between contiguous or adjacent and successive watercourses , as each system had its own specific features , and that a particular rule could not be assumed to be applicable to both types of watercourses .  
In the view of the same representative , by including the word " normally " the Commission had made it clear that the burden of proof lay upon States which wanted to apply the current draft articles to regulate rivers not flowing into a common terminus on the ground that there existed a physical relationship and a unitary whole for the major part of the length of the watercourses .  
One representative stated that , according to paragraph ( 2 ) of the commentary to draft article 3 , the Commission expressly recognized that optimal utilization , protection and development of a specific international watercourse were best achieved through an agreement tailored to the characteristics of that watercourse and to the needs of the States concerned .  
One representative , while questioning the ability of the draft articles to provide adequate environmental protection for international watercourses , wondered in particular whether the emphasis on optimal utilization did not overshadow the objective of leaving a watercourse in a pristine state .  
One representative considered that , while making the establishment of a fact finding commission compulsory represented a step forward , the optional character of recourse to conciliation constituted a step backward with respect to the conventions on codification concluded in recent decades .  266 .  Another representative was of the view that a rule for a compulsory fact-finding commission comprising three members reflected the need for a comprehensive and compulsory dispute settlement procedure .

A representative of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) emphasized that violence against women was a major public health issue , since it led to psychological trauma , depression , substance abuse , injuries , sexually transmitted diseases , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , suicide and death ; however , the victims rarely received rehabilitative care , or the compensation received by the victims of other injury-causing trauma .

Helena for administrative reasons , was not included in the Committee 's agenda .  
The representative of ECLAC stated that at present , INSTRAW was experiencing a turning point , therefore its cooperation with the regional commissions required some analysis so that INSTRAW could significantly contribute to the regional work that was taking place ; by the same token , the regional commissions could provide support to INSTRAW 's activities , based on their knowledge of their specific regional conditions , and the regional institutions dealing with the relevant subjects .  
Furthermore , the representative of DDSMS stated that the current financial situation of INSTRAW demanded that major efforts be made by the Acting Director , with the assistance of the Board members , to ensure that the level of contribution for research and training in 1995 and succeeding years be substantially increased .  
The representative of Iraq denies that his country refused to sign the minutes of the most recent meeting of the tripartite committee , which was held at Geneva on 7 April 1995 , and claims that none of the parties signed the document when Kuwait insisted on imposing political conditions that bore no relation to the humanitarian issue on which the meeting had been convened ;  
By democratization , I mean a process by which an authoritarian society becomes increasingly participatory through such mechanisms as periodic elections to representative bodies , the accountability of public officials , a transparent public administration , an independent judiciary and a free press .  
Following the massive crimes in western Slavonia in May 1995 committed by the Croatian forces , which resulted in territory cleansed of Serbs , Croatia is now resorting to the same method in the Krajina , namely , the media and international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations representative are denied access to the area before all incriminating traces are removed .  
The Panel stressed that all countries and organizations planning or proposing to organize meetings and expert consultations in support of the work of the Panel should ensure the transparent , participatory and representative nature of such initiatives as well as a balanced and active involvement of developed and developing countries from all regions and groups .

The representative of the United States of America said that at the Conferences held at Rio de Janeiro , Vienna , Cairo , Copenhagen and Beijing , Member States had been developing a blueprint for economic , social and environmental action that recognized the important linkages among the various issues considered .  
Pinning the responsibility for the suffering of the population of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina exclusively on the " Pale regime supported by Serbia " , as deliberately stated by the Muslim representative , can not divert the culpability of the Muslim-Croat authorities and free them from their role in starting the civil war , which has unleashed an unprecedented humanitarian tragedy and the continuation of the war option .  
Calling on the Secretary-General of the Conference to make appropriate arrangements for convening a regionally representative , independent and prestigious jury to review the best practice submissions and to provide special recognition to the most deserving initiatives promoting sustainable human settlements development in the form of awards to those organizations directly involved in the best practice .

the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement , and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , to the problem of internal displacement ,  
In accordance with the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 72 , introduced earlier by the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Group of Friends , the General Assembly would decide , following the recommendation of the Secretary-General , to establish a small United Nations Office of Verification ( ONUV ) , headed by an official at the appropriate political level , which would be entrusted with verifying the implementation of pending aspects of the peace agreements in El Salvador until 31 December 1996 .

The representative pointed out some of the social , political and economic consequences of the events in her country , including physical , psychological , moral and spiritual destabilization of the population , total destruction of the structures of the State and an economy which is now dominated by humanitarian assistance .  
In closing , let me say that my delegation looks forward to close collaboration with you , Sir , and all other members over the next year to advance a collective vision of a truly representative , effective and united United Nations for the twenty-first century .  
Firmly and consistently committed to the course of democratic development pursued by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan , Mr . Emomali Rakhmonov , the Government of my country promotes the involvement of the broad mass of the population in social , political and economic reform processes through such mechanisms as referendums , national elections to representative bodies , renovation of the judicial system and every possible encouragement of openness .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
It is rather incongruous that the same forces that are at the forefront of the effort to establish democratic institutions and representative governments in certain parts of the world are also engaged in an enterprise which , if successful , is calculated to destroy the free and democratic way of life in the eastern Caribbean .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
New Zealand will make that commitment , because we are committed to building a strengthened and effective United Nations that is ready and able to tackle the challenges that lie ahead , and a United Nations system that is more internationally democratic and more representative of the world we live in as the century draws to a close .  
As a representative of Poland , a country that has suffered so much war , foreign occupation and partition in its history of more than 1,000 years , I feel entitled to convey a simple message : peace is priceless , be it international , with other countries , or internal , among social partners . 
There was also a broad understanding between the concerned parties that the next step would be the formation of a political commission or a broad-based , fully representative council , although some differences still exist on composition and sequence , as well as on the issue of demobilization of armed militias , the collection of heavy weapons , demilitarization and the establishment of a national security force .  
Organizations of civil society have been praised for being flexible , responsive , representative and open to wide participation ; many function at the grass-roots level and provide vital opportunities for two-way communication with local communities .  
Fully convinced that an enlarged membership is desirable in order to take advantage of the current propitious international climate to negotiate and conclude , on the solid basis of a more representative participation , a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and other important agreements requiring universal adherence ,  
Other initiatives which his delegation was presenting to the General Assembly at the current session concerned the protection of minorities , which called for enhanced international cooperation to defuse conflict situations ; attention to the specific needs of children and juveniles in conflict with the law in the context of human rights in the administration of justice ; and the plight of internally displaced persons , in respect of which the work of the Secretary-General 's representative on that question had been crucial .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .

I am concerned about the imprudent behaviour of the south Korean representative , as it will lead to intensified confrontation between the north and the south of Korea and have a negative effect on international peace and security as a whole .  
To avoid alarmist or misleading awareness campaigns , they need reliable and representative information - e.g . , on various forest types ( boreal , temperate , tropical , wet , dry , natural , plantations , monocultures ) ; ( e ) The general public and media . 
Experience seems to recommend , however , on the one hand , the systematic designation , for all operations of whatever size , of a special representative of the Secretary-General having complete authority over the various components of the operation and , on the other hand , at least for peace-restoration and conflict-moderation operations , which almost inextricably link military tasks ( even including combat ) with negotiation and humanitarian aid activities , an integrated structure involving close cooperation between civilians and military personnel at all levels of command , including logistics .  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1996 or early 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative government and to freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;

These were cases in which an official received a gift from a representative of a foreign Government on the occasion of an official visit to the country concerned , if he or she received a gift from a community organization on a social occasion where the gift represented the work or an achievement of that organization ; or if he or she received a gift from other officers in the service on the occasion of his or her marriage , retirement , transfer or other celebratory occasion , if the present was approved by the Commissioner .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed the willingness of his Government to take immediate , active steps to promote crop substitution and rural development , in close cooperation with UNDCP and other States , by purchasing products such as wheat , cotton and rice from Afghan farmers at prices higher than they could obtain from illicit crops , by contributing to road construction , and by assisting in preventive education and public awareness campaigns for Afghan farmers .  
We note that the Permanent Representative of Lebanon , as reflected in document S / 1996 / 280 , requested that the Council convene an urgent meeting on the afternoon of Sunday , 14 April , given the grave developments in his country .  Speaking during the debate on Palestine held earlier today , the Malaysian representative referred to the worsening situation in the Middle East .  
At its 1st plenary meeting , on 5 February , after the representative of the United States of America raised a question to which the Chairman responded , the Preparatory Committee accredited to the Conference , and its preparatory process the international associations of local authorities listed in A / CONF . 165 / PC . 3 / 2 / Add . 2 ( see annex I , decision 3 / 2 ) .

Noticing that the 14-million eligible voters among the 21.3-million Republic of China citizens living in Taiwan , Penghu ( Pescadores ) , Kinmen ( Quemoy ) and Matsu area have , through universal , equal and direct suffrage and secret balloting , elected their first popularly elected president on 23 March 1996 as their genuine representative in the international community ,  
ANCELL , the representative of the Province of Santa Cruz ( Argentina ) in the National Congress of Argentina and a descendant of the native people of the Malvinas , said that territorial conquests by force had lost their currency and that the Committee had performed an outstanding task in liberating territories and returning them to their rightful owners .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
It was also suggested to include in the statute such specific grounds for the excusing and disqualification of judges as : that the judge is the injured party or a relative of the accused or of the injured party , or a national of a complainant State or of a State of which the accused is a national , or that the judge has acted as a witness , representative , counsel , public prosecutor or judge at the national level in the case involving the accused .  
In this regard , on Friday , 23 August , the Government published a statement in which it invites the entire international community , starting with Amnesty International , to immediately begin investigations of this monstrous allegation by the representative of Amnesty International in Burundi .  Today I received a copy of a message sent by the Government of Burundi to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , inviting them to increase the number of human rights observers , since the current Government ,  
By a letter dated 23 July 1996 ( A / 51 / 226-S / 1996 / 595 ) , the representative of Ukraine transmitted to the Secretary-General an aide-m \ x { 5e66 } oire on the position of Ukraine on the problems of implementation of the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council , in which it is stated , inter alia , that Ukraine has paid a high price for strict and consistent implementation of the sanctions .  
By a note verbale dated 30 August 1996 ( A / 51 / 330-S / 1996 / 721 and Corr . 1 ) , the representative of Bulgaria transmitted to the Secretary-General a national communication on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 50 / 58 E , in which it is pointed out , inter alia , that , by virtue of its geographic location and the outward nature of its economy , Bulgaria has been extremely vulnerable to the negative side effects of the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
The political leadership now has the opportunity to ensure that , in particular through the functioning of common institutions at the national level , all three communities can work towards the consolidation of a sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law , respect for the human rights of all peoples and the development of a representative democracy .  
Organizations of civil society are often flexible , responsive , representative and open to wide participation ; many function at grass-roots level and provide vital opportunities for two-way communication with local communities .  
That procedure is established in the collective agreements , with a view to protecting the worker ( requiring him to appear before a Disciplinary Council consisting of an equal number of the employer 's and workers ' representatives , and according him the right to present his defence in a written statement and to be assisted at the Disciplinary Council by a worker of his choice or by a representative of his trade union , and by lawyers ) .  
Mr . SERIWA ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that his delegation supported the statement on the question of ageing made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China . Despite the encouraging growth in the global economy , economic and social conditions in many developing countries , particularly in Africa , were still disturbing , owing to a large number of external factors such as an increased debt-burden .  
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .  
With regard to the requirement for a certified copy of the decision opening the foreign proceeding , the concern was expressed that the use of such an expression might exclude those cases in which the foreign representative was appointed , or the proceedings were commenced , without an actual decision or order of the court ( e.g . , by right pursuant to statutory authority , such as in a debtor-initiated voluntary proceeding ) .  
While agreeing with the principle that a foreign representative should be given the right to commence actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to creditors ( sometimes referred to as Paulian actions ) , the Working Group considered that it would be preferable to delete the reference to them in subparagraph ( b ) ( v ) .  
The attainment of that objective required good governance , which could be defined as government that was honest , open and equitable , that provided public institutions which were stable , responsive and reliable and that was transparent , representative , accountable and restrained .  
We are hopeful that the coming consultations will overcome these obstacles and embody the political will expressed by the leaders of the world during the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as their affirmation that the expansion of the Security Council is a basic condition for making its membership more representative and its working methods more transparent .  
Our ultimate objective in pursuing these reforms is to bring about a democratic , representative , dynamic and revitalized Security Council which will be more relevant to the common problems we all face .  
My delegation believes that our proposals on the size of the permanent membership and on the size and geographical composition of the non-permanent membership are a material and proper approach to the reform of the Security Council if the Council is to continue to have credibility as an institution which is representative of the international community as a whole and which therefore has the legal and moral authority to act on its behalf .

Refuting the so-called reliable sources of the Special Rapporteur as being linked to other States or in the pay of the United States secret services , the representative of Iraq said that the accusations concerning the violation of the political and civil rights of the Iraqi population by means of laws imposing cruel and inhuman penalties , which those sources had reported , were totally groundless since those laws had been repealed , as the Centre for Human Rights and other international bodies could confirm .  
The representative of Norway , a country with which Burundi had excellent cooperative relations , had , at a previous meeting , said that the coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at that had taken place in Burundi in 1995 had not improved the security or human rights situation but , on the contrary , had exacerbated the suffering of the people .  
The representative of Ireland , speaking for the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .

The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern that the Trade and Development Report 's forecast of slow world economic growth reflected the effects of the unequal access of developing countries to external lending and FDI .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
The representative of Australia complimented the secretariat on its analysis of factors contributing to dynamic growth in East Asia and noted that the Trade and Development Report 1996 pointed to the important role in the growth of economies in the region played by the rapid expansion of exports of labour _ intensive manufactures to major developed countries . 
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election and take part freely in a representative Government , and to freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
The representative of the European Commission said that it was likely that the number of transborder RBPs ( particularly cartels , abuses of dominance and mergers having international effects ) had increased in proportion with the considerable growth in international trade , in foreign direct investment , and in the size and number of transnational corporations .  
PRANDLER ( Hungary ) said that the word " ecosystems " should be defined in article 2 and that article 20 could be further strengthened by including three additional elements , namely : the prevention , reduction and control of pollution ; the need for ecologically sound and rational water management , conservation of water resources ( including freshwater systems ) and environmental protection ; and the conservation and , where necessary , the regeneration of the ecosystems of international watercourses , as already proposed by the Venezuelan representative with the support of others .  
The offer , promise or giving of any payment , gift or other advantage , directly or indirectly , by any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from a State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
The soliciting , demanding , accepting or receiving , directly or indirectly , by any public official or elected representative of a State from any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from another country of any payment , gift or other advantage , as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;

In this context , as requested in the draft resolution , the Special Mission would continue its efforts to facilitate national reconciliation and reconstruction in Afghanistan , in particular by mediating an end to the conflict and facilitating the implementation of a peaceful settlement by promoting a fully representative and broad-based transitional government which could control the national security force and create conditions for free and fair elections leading to a representative national Government .  
His delegation , which fully associated itself with the views expressed at a previous meeting by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union , was of the view that the court , though closely linked to the United Nations , should be an independent international institution established by a multilateral treaty .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on the respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
The world community must send a clear signal to the warring parties immediately to halt all hostilities , refrain from the use of force , set aside their differences and engage in political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation , a lasting political settlement to the conflict and the establishment of a completely representative and broad-based transitional Government of national unity .  
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under those objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
It was proposed that , within the context of article 15 ( 1 ) , the powers of the foreign representative or other person designated by the court should be limited to measures destined to preserve three categories of assets : perishable assets , assets susceptible of devaluation and assets otherwise in jeopardy , such as where there was an imminent danger of their being concealed or dissipated .  
The Commission , however , decided that the automatic stay should cover not only execution of claims but also the individual actions and proceedings conducted prior to execution ; that was considered necessary to allow the foreign representative the necessary temporary respite to organize the affairs of the debtor without having to participate in possibly numerous actions against the debtor .  
The Commission considered the question whether the Model Provisions should expressly provide that a foreign representative had procedural " standing " ( a concept in some procedural systems referred to by expressions such as " active procedural legitimation " , " active legitimation " or " legitimation " ) to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors ( such actions were sometimes referred to as " Paulian actions " ) .  
It was said that , if such standing was to be conferred on the foreign representative , it should extend only to actions that were available to the local insolvency administrator in the context of an insolvency proceeding opened in the enacting State ; care should be taken to avoid creating an impression that the foreign representative was equated with individual creditors , who under many legal systems had a right to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors .  
Emphasizing the importance of the democratic , efficient , transparent and representative governing structures of the United Nations Environment Programme , with a complementary , specific and distinct role and mandate for each of their components ,  
Considering the increased cooperation we have witnessed during the past year in support of Latin American and Caribbean Member States in the field of designing policies on social development including the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development on economic integration and on trends in the globalization process , our delegations are in favour of a further broadening and deepening of the mutual supporting activities between ECLAC and the Latin American Economic System , as expressed this morning by the representative of Peru .  
Mr . Yakovlev ( Russian Federation ) ( interpretation from Russian ) : The purposes set out in the statutes of the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) to unite parliamentarians to secure the broad participation of States in the strengthening of international peace and security , in the firm establishment of representative institutions and in the defence of human rights are largely consonant with the aspirations of the United Nations .  
Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy representative of its Group in that most important organ and to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy : the promotion of human rights , respect for international humanitarian law , respect for the principle of non-intervention , total compliance with the prohibition of the use of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal means of implementing the right of peoples to self-determination .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
In this context , the European Union wishes to express very warm thanks to Mr . Vranitzky , the personal representative of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office , for his remarkable efforts in the field and within international organizations to enable parliamentary elections to be held in acceptable conditions on 29 June 1997 .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
We must see to it that these trends are strengthened and that the way is cleared for specific , tangible steps that would make it possible to move to address in practical terms the question of the cessation of the armed conflict and the start of a political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation and the establishment in Afghanistan of a broad-based , fully representative government .  
The elimination of our armed forces and the demilitarization of our society have fostered a broad , pluralistic , representative system in the form of a democratic and social state of law , which is the legal structure representing the will for peace , conciliation and harmonious coexistence Costa Ricans have chosen .  
We welcome you as a high-ranking official and a professional of established authority , as well as a representative of Ukraine , a country with which Belarus maintains close and friendly relations and which is making a valuable contribution to international cooperation within the framework of the United Nations .  
The decision also served as a basis for an appeal from the Federation Council to legislative ( representative ) and executive organs of State power of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation that the situation regarding the provision of supplies and equipment to the Russian penal system which had deteriorated markedly in recent years ; the conditions of detention in remand centres ( sizos ) under the control of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MVD ) constituted flagrant violations of human rights and of the law and the international obligations of the Russian Federation .  
Independent , speedy and effective legal and / or administrative procedures for seeking redress , containing such features as fast-tracking for cases where the complainant is terminally ill , investigatory powers to address systemic cases of discrimination in policies and procedures , ability to bring cases under pseudonym and representative complaints , including the possibility of public interest organizations bringing cases on behalf of people living with HIV / AIDS ;  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
The Office 's special programmes and projects shall consist of specialized activities concerning , inter alia , displaced persons , the rights of women , the rights of children and adolescents , the penal and prison systems , indigenous communities , disabled persons and other sectors in need of special protection .  22 .  The representative of the National Observatory for Human Rights of Algeria advised that the Observatory was based on the principle of institutional and cultural pluralism .  
The representative of the National Commission on Human Rights of Cameroon stated that at the regional level , other African national human rights institutions had entrusted Cameroon 's National Commission with the task of planning , preparing and hosting the first African Regional Conference of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights with the objective , among others , of encouraging States in the region to create their own national institutions ( see also paras .  25 _ 27 ) .  
However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .  
It was pointed out that many if not all national procedural laws contemplated cases where a party ( the foreign representative in the current provision ) who demonstrated a legal interest in the outcome of a dispute between two other parties was permitted by the court deciding the dispute to be heard in the proceedings .  
However , the view was also expressed that , for those legal systems where the words " to intervene " were not well understood , those words might be given a different interpretation , and in particular that they might carry the meaning that the foreign representative might substitute for the debtor in judicial actions .  
The representative explained that the definition of child sex tourism as presently worded was too broad and too vague and thus presented difficulties as regards its application at the national legislative level , particularly in her country which provided for the direct application of international standards .  
The representative of Uruguay supported by the observer for Costa Rica , stressed the importance of preventive measures and international cooperation in eradicating basic problems such as socio _ economic ones , which made children more vulnerable to such practices . 
First of all , in the view of ACC members , the report does not take sufficient account of the broad variety of NGOs , whose roles , operational procedures and financial requirements are quite different , ranging from large international organizations to national support NGOs and representative peoples ' organizations .  
They also try to ensure that the guidelines include the main criteria to be fulfilled by NGOs applying for consultative status , such as being of a representative character and having a recognized standing , as well as having an established record in areas falling within the competence of a given agency .  
The continued preference of some of the warring Afghan parties for the military option , and their intransigence and lack of responsiveness to the strenuous efforts of the special representative to achieve a comprehensive settlement , confirm the need to develop the efforts currently being made by the United Nations and to direct these efforts to more practical steps leading to the creation of the climate necessary for the implementation of the proposals made to date and of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject .  
Despite strenuous diplomatic efforts , in particular by the Secretary-General and his special representative , Mr . Nobert Holl , to broker a ceasefire and engage the warring parties in a peace process , the fighting has been raging unabated , with even greater intensity in recent months . 
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Consequently , it is the individual concerned , the citizen , who is fully entitled , directly or indirectly , to choose those who exercise the governmental , representative or legislative function , and who renews or withdraws his trust _ or rather his delegation of authority _ at predetermined intervals and in accordance with rules that protect his freedom of choice and punish any attempt to vitiate or divert it .  
On anti _ personnel landmines , we have heard a rather dramatic reference made in the statement of the distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal and the representative of Kenya to the importance of the issue in some regions , and the importance of rapid and effective humanitarian action , but also I think that the significant reflection of these and other statements is that the issue is an issue of importance for the Conference on Disarmament and that we await a pronouncement in this regard .  
When the Human Rights Committee considered France 's report in 1983 , an extremely instructive debate took place on the validity of the reservations made by France to article 4 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 35 The expert from the German Democratic Republic asserted that France had confirmed that reservations to article 4 were permissible , in response to which the representative of France said that the reservations were limited to paragraph 1 of that article . 
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under these objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
The representative informed the Committee that plans now in place to allow pregnant teenagers to continue their education included working with fathers as appropriate and the provision of functional literacy skills programmes , skills training , parenting classes and family life education , which involved family planning and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) education . 
In view of the current situation in Haiti , so ably described today by the representative of Haiti , we can not but conclude that the primary objective of UNSMIH 's mandate has not yet been fully accomplished , and that sustained international assistance remains essential .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc . 
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc .  3 .  Recommendations to Governments :  
In the broad context of the complicated general situation in Africa , the Security Council decided to devote special attention to the situation in the Republic of Sierra Leone , as part of the international community 's effort over the past three years through the United Nations , in coordination with the Organization of African Unity , subregional organizations and the Governments of the region to restore pluralistic and representative democracy , and promote respect for human rights and peace and national reconciliation in that country . 
With its unique nature , its special mandate and its open-ended composition it could contribute greatly to the process of restructuring the Organization , giving an enhanced role to the General Assembly as the most representative body and increasing the representativeness of the Security Council by expanding the participation of developing countries , in conformity with the principle of sovereign equality as well as equitable geographical representation .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
In situations where political mediation , peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian relief are carried out simultaneously , the special representative of the Secretary-General helps secure a cohesive overall approach by ensuring that activities are mutually reinforcing and that the respective tasks to be performed are clearly defined .  
While there was no simple solution to pursuing development goals in an increasingly competitive and globalized world and even though economic growth was not automatic , notable strides had been made by those who embraced credible macro-economic settings ; those who addressed the social dimension of development in tandem with the pursuit of economic growth ; those who fostered domestic private sector development ; and those who pursued representative , open and accountable governance .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
In his reports to the Commission and the General Assembly , the representative has provided information on the magnitude of internal displacement worldwide , has identified specific needs of the internally displaced for protection and assistance , including highlighting the particular problems faced by women and children , has assessed the extent to which those needs are being met under existing normative and institutional frameworks and has reported in detail on specific country situations that he , through his country visits , has studied first-hand .  
It is symbolic that a representative of a renewed democracy which is living through a period of fundamental social , economic and political reforms , has become President of the General Assembly at a time when the issue of United Nations reform tops its agenda .  
Many a representative has drawn attention to the continued and widespread growth of the global economy as we move towards the close of the century and to the broadening of the reach of economic growth in developing countries to include an increasing number of low-income countries .  
The Dominican Republic attaches special importance to the ongoing reform process , given that it is capable , while respecting the principles and purposes that gave birth to the Organization , of ensuring a more democratic , transparent , representative and efficient system capable of facing the current challenges , especially those of peace and the problems of poverty that affect the peoples of the world .  
Each must agree to subordinate its individual decision and discretion to a global political will , manifested through truly democratic and representative organs of the United Nations , reflecting the authentic judgement of the world community of States .  
In the United States , we have raised the minimum wage , expanded tax credits for working families and reduced the federal deficit , all of which provide the basis for investment , growth and job creation .  The lesson we have learned is that a flexible job market that facilitates mobility , an economy open to competition and sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a Government that is representative , transparent and accountable , all contribute to the creation of jobs .  
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
My delegation wishes to emphasize that current realities of the post-cold-war era the diffusion of political , economic and military power among diverse regions of the world require that decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security be made in a more representative and democratic manner , mindful of the sovereign equality of all States .  
In conclusion , my delegation pledges its support to you , Mr . President , including in your capacity as Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group , to take our work forward in a practical and constructive manner towards an outcome which will result in an expanded , more representative , more transparent Security Council , better equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century .  
I am especially pleased that the General Assembly has elected to this very responsible function a very competent representative from Ukraine , a friendly country with which the Republic of Macedonia is developing successful cooperation .  
That global programme set up through United Nations inter-agency cooperation and underpinned by strong support at the national level in many countries , facilitated the establishment of a network of representative basins , improving understanding of hydrology and water resource management .  
The Secretary-General has the honour to submit to the Council for confirmation , pursuant to rule 11 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , an additional name of a representative of the member of the functional commission listed below that has been received since the close of the organizational session for 1996 .  
As a representative of national organizations which remained in place after international organizations had completed their work , the Federation trusted that more governments would take steps to create an environment conducive to a constructive dialogue and effective cooperation , so that non-governmental organizations could function effectively . 
My delegation is delighted to see the Chair of the CD occupied by a representative of Romania , a country with which Poland is linked by traditional bonds of friendship , which _ as confirmed during the recent visit of the President of Romania , Emil Constantinescu , to Warsaw _ is firmly based on shared values and aspirations .  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country and , to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
The representative of Ireland , speaking on behalf of the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
I am delighted to see you in the Chair of this distinguished assembly , as the representative of a country with which Italy has maintained , through centuries , deep relations of cooperation and cultural exchanges of which I , myself , had the privilege , in a previous professional experience , to be a witness and a promoter . 
The representative of the Netherlands also expressed the view that the consolidated text was acceptable as a bare minimum , and that , after resolving the remaining issue , it should be adopted by the Working Group without substantial debate and changes .  
With regard to new article W , the representative of Germany stated that his delegation placed mental brackets on the adoption by consensus of new article W . His delegation reserved its final position with the understanding that either lawfully and openly or from a legitimate source would be removed from the present wording . 
The representative of the Netherlands felt that a provision for resource mobilization as proposed by the representative of South Africa should not include a reference to the single general domestic legislation clause , because it would be redundant and might set a bad precedent for the inclusion of similar restrictions in other provisions contained in the consolidated text .  
The representative of the United Kingdom found the original proposal of the representative of South Africa for a new article W acceptable to his delegation , because it maintained the status quo ( i.e . funding of human rights defenders being subject to national legislation consistent with applicable international law ) .  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi _ party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative Government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
The question of displaced persons was settled by agreement between the two sides at the third round of the intercommunal talks held at Vienna between 31 July and 2 August 1975 , whereby the two sides agreed on a voluntary ( not forcible expulsion , as the Greek Cypriot representative alleges ) regrouping of populations in their own respective territory , the Turkish Cypriots in the North and the Greek Cypriots in the South , paving the way for a bi-zonal settlement of the Cyprus question . 
The indicators meet certain essential criteria : they are considered to be ethical , useful , scientifically robust , representative , understandable and accessible .  
Mr . Al-Humaimidi ( Iraq ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the comments made by the United States representative following the introduction of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq had been motivated by that countrys desire to prevent the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq , despite Iraqs full compliance with the relevant Security Council resolution and contrary to the views of most members of the international community . 
It was suggested that the surveys might be focused only on urban areas or on a selected number of representative administrative and territorial units within the national territory of a State for which the most complete and reliable data were available .  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi _ party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative Government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
These facts have not been enough to persuade the representative of the United States of America to desist from using irresponsible methods to prevent thousands of sick children , older persons and women from obtaining the medicines they need to alleviate the suffering brought on by the diseases they have contracted as a result of the maintenance of the unjust embargo against Iraq , which has taken on a political and biased character and which has the goal of undermining the national political regime in Iraq .  
These facts have not been enough to persuade the representative of the United States of America to desist from using irresponsible methods to prevent thousands of sick children , older persons and women from obtaining the drugs they need to alleviate the suffering brought on by the diseases they have contracted as a result of the maintenance of the unjust embargo against Iraq , which has taken on a political and biased character and which has the goal of undermining the national political regime in Iraq . 
While there is no commonly accepted definition of what good governance , or " capable " government , means in operational terms , at the very least it signifies the existence of a stable and relatively open and transparent political framework that is representative of , and responsive to , the will of the people .  
I should like to call your attention to the fact that , during the initial 180-day period the Memorandum of Understanding has been in effect , the representative of the United States of America in the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) has deliberately obstructed and delayed the processing of contracts in the Committee for odious political reasons inimical to the people of Iraq .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on the respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
Noting that Canada faced new domestic and global socio-economic challenges , the representative emphasized that Canada had taken decisive steps to provide women with an effective legal framework against discrimination . 
However , as the representative of Zaire arrived in New York expecting to present the State party 's initial report , the Committee instead agreed that the representative of Zaire would make an oral report on an exceptional basis on the situation of women in Zaire . The Committee agreed on the understanding that the regular report of Zaire would be rescheduled for consideration by the Committee at a future date .  
She hoped , however , that the international community would not limit its efforts to the application of that initiative but would also propose solutions that were suitable to the developing countries , especially the least developed ones , so that they could use their national financial resources to undertake economic reforms that were vital for their development .  85 .  Mr . OUCH ( Cambodia ) said that he fully supported the statement made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent and representative , and it should influence both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners , and it must occur at all appropriate levels of government .  
Although she would have preferred the word economic to be retained , the representative of Cuba , with a view to achieving a consensus , interpreted such assistance as being included within social assistance and accepted that understanding .  
The representative stated that women living in rural areas , particularly those belonging to indigenous groups , remained marginalized and had higher rates of maternal mortality , adolescent pregnancy and illiteracy than women living in Perus urban centres .  
As the most representative of the existing multilateral institutions , the United Nations must be involved in all aspects of a process that had such broad economic , financial , political and social implications .  
Another indigenous representative from Oceania recognized that , despite difficulties , some progress had been made in indigenous health conditions and that traditional cultural , social and spiritual needs were addressed in close cooperation with local groups .  
The representative of Cuba said that orthodox liberalization and deregulation policies had been catastrophic for the East Asian economies , which were as vulnerable to external factors as they were attractive for international capital flows . 
The selection and management of additional protected forest areas should be based on their value as representative or unique forest types ; their potential to generate information on ecological processes ; the conservation of biological diversity and ecosystem services ; and due consideration to the livelihoods of the communities depending on them .  
We believe that the establishment of a reliable system for European security and stability is possible only on a common European basis with unswerving observance of international law and by making use of the potential of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) as the most representative and universal common European organization capable of dealing with all the challenges of the twenty-first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian ones .  
While other agencies had long faced problems in choosing legitimate or representative partners in the private sector , those partners were usually non-profit bodies , whereas working on operational projects with profit-seeking partners was clearly more problematic ; association with the United Nations could be interpreted as giving an unfair commercial advantage over its competitors , national and international . 
At a meeting with me , on 11 December 1998 , an ECOWAS ministerial delegation on the Guinea-Bissau issues reiterated that ECOWAS needed logistical and financial support in order to proceed with the speedy deployment of the ECOMOG interposition force , the key operational support instrument for the implementation of the Agreement on the ground .  The delegation emphasized the importance of United Nations / ECOWAS collaboration and asked me to appoint a representative in that country .  
We are convinced that the construction of a reliable system of European security and stability is possible only on a pan _ European basis , in a context of unswerving respect for international law , and using the potential of OSCE as the most representative and universal all _ European organization which can address all the challenges of the twenty _ first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian .

The provision would cover the costs of : ( a ) attendance by the Chairman and 33 members at the annual session at Geneva ; ( b ) attendance by the Chairman at the regular sessions of the Assembly during consideration of the Commissions reports ; and ( c ) attendance by the Chairman or another representative of the Commission at the sessions of the four regional legal intergovernmental bodies ( two weeks each ) with which the Commission , pursuant to its statute , has established links of cooperation .  
In her introduction , the representative of Kyrgyzstan informed the Committee that the initial report had been prepared by a special commission established for that purpose that included governmental and legal officials .  
The Committee expresses its appreciation to the Government of Thailand for its candid and comprehensive report , a supplementary report , as well as the additional information and written responses to the numerous questions put forward by the pre-session working group , as well as the clear responses provided in the oral presentation made by the representative of Thailand .  
Mr . RENGER ( Germany ) , referring to the suggestion made by the representative of Spain that paragraph 53 should be redrafted as several separate paragraphs , said that if that proposal was accepted he would suggest the inclusion of a further clarification , namely , whether lenders were entitled to keep the payments received during the critical period prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings .  The meeting rose at 6 p.m .  
In many countries , the United Nations ( resident coordinator / UNDP resident representative ) , the World Bank or often the two together convene meetings with donor and national government representatives to exchange information on current and planned programmes and discuss critical policy issues .  In some countries which use the consultative group mechanism , the resident coordinator chairs regular meetings of locally represented donors , while the World Bank convenes the consultative group itself .  
COSPARs record as the most representative international scientific organization on all matters related to research in space puts it in the position of a well-tested machine , instrumental for efficient and rapid dissemination of the newest results pertaining to all areas of space research and able to promote a truly unbiased and global assessment of proposed programmes of exploration in space .

Any suspension shall be limited to a specific and stated purpose and to the period required to achieve it .  
The Advisory Group wishes to express its deep gratitude to all the entities at the multilateral and bilateral levels involved in assisting Haiti in completing its task , in particular the World Bank , the office of the representative of the Secretary-General in Haiti , and the office of the resident coordinator in Haiti .  
The principal United Nations humanitarian agencies UNHCR , the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , UNICEF and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as well as the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , ICRC and the International Federation of the Red Cross ( IFRC ) have established representative offices at Pristina and are operating in all regions .  Over 45 NGOs , along with major bilateral donors , have committed personnel and resources to meet the immediate relief needs of the people of Kosovo .  
The improvement of the overall human rights situation would require the emergence of a framework for building peace through an inclusive participatory process involving continuing consultations with all segments of the Afghan people , aimed at establishing a broad _ based , multi _ ethnic and fully representative government .  
The Special Rapporteur stressed that in order for a legal act to be valid under international law , it must be attributable to a State , the representative of that State must have the capacity to engage it at the international level , the act must be the expression of its will and free of irregularities and it must be formulated in the proper manner .

An indigenous representative from Manipur in India said that recent developments in India indicated that existing domestic and international mechanisms to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples , including children , and to conserve vital wetlands and sensitive eco-zones of spiritual value had failed to fulfil their objectives , despite strong efforts by the indigenous peoples in Manipur to protect their human rights .  
At the same meeting , following a statement by the representative of the Secretariat , the Commission acting as preparatory body approved and recommended to the General Assembly the provisional agenda and organizational arrangements contained in document E / CN . 17 / 1999 / PC / CRP . 1 for adoption at the special session , as amended ( see chap .  V , sect .

As a representative of a State subjected to an unprecedented humanitarian disaster due to the sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the aggression carried out daily by two permanent Council Members , I launch an appeal to the Council to abandon the double standard and to be true to the role assigned to it in the Charter .  
The representative of CSI acknowledged that the incident in question included a number of procedural errors as detailed in the formal written response submitted to the Committee .  
The representative further stated that it would be a great misfortune for the defenders of human rights if a precedent was set whereby any non-governmental organization involved in a technical-procedural error was to be punished unduly on the basis of one specific case .  
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
Police restructuring involves reducing the number of excess police and ensuring that the rationalized police forces are representative of the ethnic composition of the community they serve and that they work within legitimate , transparent , accountable and professional organizational structures .

The Presidents of the two countries , General Pervez Musharraf and Mr . Mohammad Khatami , assured me in no uncertain terms that , because the see the establishment of a stable and representative Government accountable to all Afghans to be in their own national interests , they would like the United Nations to play a pivotal role in the process of finding a political solution .  
It consists of the need to help the people of Afghanistan establish a responsible , representative , accountable and stable Government which enjoys internal and external legitimacy ; is committed to respecting and promoting the rights of all its men , women and children ; enjoys peaceful and friendly relations with all its neighbours ; and is able to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be used as a breeding and staging ground for terrorists or drug-traffickers .

Secondly , the meeting would suggest concrete steps for the convening of a provisional council , which would be composed of a fairly large and representative group of Afghans drawn from all ethnic and regional communities .  
The overall goal is to find what Mr . Brahimi called a home-grown solution one which is credible , legitimate and sustainable and leads to a broad-based Government which is responsible , representative , stable and accountable ; enjoys both internal and external stability ; respects the human rights of the Afghan people ; and will never again allow the country to be used as a breeding ground for terror or drug trafficking .

The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , reiterated the importance attached by his Group to the question of the financing of experts in UNCTAD expert meetings and the need for funding in that respect .
