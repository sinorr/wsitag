Even if it were assumed that globalization was an integral aspect of the normative structure of the established international economic system , the concerns expressed by the Group of 77 and others would seem to require additional antidotes , such as the establishment , for preventative purposes , of sound fiscal and monetary policies and early-warning systems , or normative counter-weights .

Regarding the financial aspects of this project , it is anticipated that although the revised project cost of construction will exceed the amount approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , the additional requirement , excluding claims , could be covered , with the approval of the General Assembly , by interest earned on the construction-in-progress funds and , therefore , no additional appropriation would be required under the regular budget beyond the amount of $ 107,576,900 originally approved .  
As indicated in paragraph 12 of the Secretary-General 's report , the contingency fund , approved at 0.75 per cent of the overall level of resources for the first outline , has been maintained at that level for all subsequent ones ; it has always proved to be adequate to accommodate additional expenditures derived from legislative mandates not provided for in the proposed programme budget , as defined in resolutions 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 and subsequent resolutions on the subject .

While we recognized that the right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations , it was also recognized that meeting the environmental objectives in Agenda 21 would place additional , even onerous , burdens on developing countries .  
The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .

These negotiations will have special importance for the future work of the GEF , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national level .  
While the number of personnel requiring rations is lower than in the prior period , the increase is attributable to the higher cost of bottled water ( $ 0.57 ) than in the previous period ( $ 0.50 ) and the additional requirement for bottled water for the team sites for cooking purposes , consumption by visiting flight crews and its use for generators to prevent potential damage to the equipment by the high salt and mineral content of local water . ( e ) Daily allowance .

The Israeli Government decision to establish new Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem runs counter to the spirit of peace that now prevails in the region , and constitutes an additional obstacle to the creation of a climate of understanding , reconciliation and religious tolerance in that age-old holy city held so dear by the world 's three great monotheistic religions .  
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
It reiterated the need for external support through ODA and the provision of new and additional financial resources , and emphasized the need to mobilize new , innovative and additional forms of finance at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels .  
Efforts in developing countries to secure additional financial resources and technology at domestic level need to be strengthened , and should be supplemented from international sources .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,

Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
A major strategic study carried out jointly by UNDP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) indicates that under current conditions a significant portion of the beneficiaries farming systems will be viable over the next five years only if they receive an additional , medium-term programme of support that includes locally based technical assistance , timely credit with special conditions , and social and productive infrastructure .  
This action has received increased support from different donor sources ; however , additional and increased development assistance is to be directed towards the basic social services with a view to improving primary and reproductive health care , basic education , skills development and literacy in priority , to at least meet the targets set by recent international conferences . 
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .

The idea was also raised that building up a domestic institutional investor base could help provide additional local private demand for marketable securities .  
At the national level , review arrangements , such as the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups , organized by the least developed countries with the support of the respective organizations , have been further consolidated during the early 1990s , with additional countries joining or rejoining the process and meetings taking place more frequently and on a more regular basis .

In taking this step , I have considered the prevailing precarious situation in Angola , the incomplete nature of the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol , the need to give the parties an additional chance to complete the peace process , as well as the need to ensure the security of United Nations and other international personnel in Angola .  
It is based on the contributions requested by the Division for the Advancement of Women , which focused on additional action taken by the relevant entities in support of the implementation of the Platform for Action since the submission of the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / 51 / 322 ) and on means of implementation , including new human resources , financial means and structural changes .

The Secretary stressed that the urgent need for , and potential costs of , additional office space would be among the most important matters to be addressed during the remainder of 1997 and in the long-term concept paper on administrative arrangements to be presented to the Board in 1998 .  31 .  The Secretary also indicated that the inevitable result of changing significantly the administrative arrangements between the Fund and the United Nations would be a substantial increase in the administrative expenses to be charged against the resources of the Fund .

The objective in this thematic area is to provide Arab societies with additional capacity for pro-poor strategy , policy and programme development and implementation by increasing their ability to effectively formulate pro-poor policies and programmes and enhancing the performance of institutions ( public , private , civil society ) that deal with services for social development and especially for poverty eradication .  
Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
During the same period , in 1994 , additional work and project changes were requested by ECA , which , inter alia , included electrical , mechanical and special system requirements such as additional and uninterruptible power supply , building automated control system and anti-intrusion security .  Some of these changes were the result of modified user requirements , or for greater operational efficiency , and to take advantage of changes in technology since the original design was drawn , for example innovations in fibre optics .  
He underscored the importance of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries and said that additional resources were needed in support of such cooperation from the United Nations system , international financial institutions and other public and private sources .

While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
Paragraph 4 indicated that the net reduction of $ 25.1-million reflected the combined effect of projected additional requirements of $ 31.6-million due to changes in inflation assumptions , commitments entered into under resolution 50 / 217 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses and commitments authorized by the General Assembly ; a $ 28.7-million decrease in income ; and an anticipated reduction of $ 85.4-million due to changes in exchange rate assumptions , variations in post and common staff costs and adjustments to objects of expenditure other than posts .

The emergence of an active biochemical prospecting market can provide an additional means of converting the potential future value of biodiversity into current income for those most responsible for , and most affected by , the preservation of biologically diverse ecosystems .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) .

While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
United Nations observations conducted in 87 schools and a detailed infrastructure survey by UNICEF in mid-1997 of an additional 150 schools showed a severe shortage of desks , resulting in an average of four pupils sharing a desk for two and approximately 50 per cent of the students sitting on the floor , lack of teaching aids , buildings in dilapidated condition and a lack of operational water and sanitation facilities .

In this connection , some Governments have argued that the acceptance of gratis personnel performing mandated activities would not , therefore , involve additional financial liability for the Organization since support costs have already been included in the budgets ; this argument is valid only if the gratis personnel are to be considered a substitute for staff to be recruited against authorized posts for the implementation of the approved activities .  
Although the Advisory Committee appreciated that the overall level of peacekeeping activity would decline as more and more missions were liquidated , it had concluded that there were a number of shortcomings in the Secretariat 's analysis of the workload of peacekeeping missions , for it had had difficulty relating the Secretary-General 's proposals for net additional posts to the actual or projected workload .

Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;

The assessment provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas to contribute to the achievement of national objectives and , by ensuring coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors , sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
Such a situation would create additional pressure on developing countries , including small island developing States , to meet their growing domestic demand for fish as food on the one hand a problem likely to be aggravated by declining productivity of coastal fisheries due to coral reef degradation , as previously discussed and to increase their share of international markets on the other .  
The Controller had informed the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in a letter dated 26 September 1997 that the cost of a few additional officers specialized in political , civil and legal affairs would be provided under general temporary assistance ( equivalent to 1 P-5 , 2-P-4 , 2 General Service and 1 Field Service ) from within approved resources .

If , for those reasons , such specific form requirements were to remain outside the scope of the Uniform Rules , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be further clarified , possibly in the context of draft article B . The Working Group agreed that discussion as to that issue might need to be reopened at a later stage . 
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continuing coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross-purposes ;  
Even the initial analysis of the recommendations and proposals made by several United Nations bodies and mechanisms active in the field of human rights makes it possible to single out a number of major themes that could be considered by the World Conference with a view to formulating recommendations for the adoption of additional measures to combat racism at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Peruvian Government , for its part , considered that the World Conference should formulate concrete recommendations making it possible to increase the effectiveness of existing machinery used to combat racial discrimination and to adopt additional measures at the national , regional and international levels to strengthen those already in place .

Considers intolerable that more than 800-million people , especially women and children , throughout the world , and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas ;  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .

At its 60th meeting , on 28 April 1999 , the Commission on Human Rights , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on its agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's requests for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ fifth session , decided , without a vote : 
The Committee congratulates the Government for the high level and large size of its delegation , headed by the Permanent Representative to the United Nations , which established a constructive , open and sincere dialogue with members of the Committee , and in its oral presentation gave additional specific and objective information as well as statistical data enabling the Committee to understand the de jure and de facto situation of Algerian women .  
The Committee expresses its appreciation to the Government of Thailand for its candid and comprehensive report , a supplementary report , as well as the additional information and written responses to the numerous questions put forward by the pre-session working group , as well as the clear responses provided in the oral presentation made by the representative of Thailand .  
Requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of funds from the regular budget or extrabudgetary resources , to arrange for additional meetings to be scheduled for negotiation of the protocols , with a view to enhancing the potential for the expeditious and simultaneous completion of the convention against transnational organized crime and the protocols thereto ;  
Pursuant to resolution 1201 ( 1998 ) , by which the Security Council mandated MINURCA to support the conduct of legislative elections in the Central African Republic in November and December 1998 , operational plans developed by MINURCA called for the deployment for a period of 2.5 months of an additional 21 international and 18 local staff , 94 medium and short-term electoral observers and for the provision of related additional air , transportation and communications assets .  
The GEF with its focus on additional concessional funding to meet incremental costs of projects of global benefits in the four focal areas of climate change , biological diversity , the ozone layer and international waters has a special and growing role .  
Moreover , although related costs for international salaries and common staff costs were calculated on the basis of 50 per cent of staff on appointments of limited duration , mission appointees ranged from 75 to 80 per cent of the total , contributing to additional savings under civilian personnel costs . 
The unencumbered balance of $ 4,571,900 gross ( $ 4,275,100 net ) resulted from reduced requirements as follows : military personnel costs ( $ 83,000 ) , civilian personnel costs ( $ 4,368,400 ) , operational costs ( $ 2,247,300 ) and staff assessment ( $ 296,800 ) ; these were offset by additional requirements amounting to $ 2,423,600 as follows : other programmes ( $ 19,300 ) and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ( $ 2,404,300 ) ( A / 53 / 908 , annex II ) .  
Thus , the international community , especially the United Nations , must step up its activities to end the humanitarian suffering of the victims of the situation and of those States that have sheltered a large number of refugees and displaced persons , thereby assuming a significant additional material and logistical burden .  
In conclusion , the Committees proposal for an additional regular session to be held in New York is driven by a commitment to the interdependence and indivisibility of all rights , as well as a recognition of the renewed interest in economic , social and cultural rights which is evident in the work of the United Nations human rights system .  
The Secretary-General may , in exceptional and compelling circumstances , authorize a reasonable increase in the travel subsistence allowance to be paid to a staff member who is required to accompany a senior official and whose official duties while in travel status require that his or her additional living expense be established at a rate substantially higher than that contemplated in setting the allowance rate for his or her level .  
Internationally recruited staff members serving at designated duty stations having very difficult conditions of life and work shall be granted once a year , under conditions established by the Secretary-General , an additional shipment entitlement to the duty station by the most economical means of up to 50 kilograms or 0.31 cubic metres , in respect of the staff member and each eligible family member for whom the Organization has paid travel costs to the duty station .  
Affirming that , in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements5 it was recognized , inter alia , that the Habitat Agenda could only be effectively implemented if the role and functions of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) were strengthened and adequate financial resources , including new and additional resources from all sources , were mobilized at the national and international levels ,  
The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list , in the light of additional information that may become available , for the purposes of identifying items that are subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .  
An entire new cluster of WHO technical programmes has also been established to promote health in the context of sustainable human development , including a renewed emphasis on reducing malnutrition and improving management of environmental risks to human health , integrating health dimensions into poverty reduction programmes and protecting vulnerable populations in situations of crisis and post-crisis ; promoting the synergy between health and human rights constitutes an additional priority .  
The Group of Experts was aware that an efficient and effective revenue administration can help developing countries and transitional economies to mobilize additional revenue resources and achieve greater financial self-reliance in facilitating and achieving sustainable economic development .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .  
Consideration of additional international legal instruments : 3 .  States Parties shall foster development programmes and cooperation at the national , regional and international levels , paying special attention to economically and socially depressed areas , in order to combat the root socio-economic causes of the trafficking of migrants .  
Since this was likely to prove particularly difficult at the international level and be of limited relevance to international commercial transactions , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be clarified .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
This calls for new and additional resources from donor countries and international financial institutions to complement national efforts and resources for the further implementation of the noble principles of the ICPD Programme of Action and to reverse the current decline in overall official development assistance .  
To be effective , such a policy initiative would need to backed by funds which are additional to current aid flows , and it should be accompanied by measures in the form of technical and other assistance to ensure that national administrations are in a position to effectively undertake expenditure devoted to social purposes .  
While the transparency commitments made under the SPS Agreement had improved the flow of information on SPS-related regulations of WTO member countries , an application of country-specific SPS requirements beyond what was recommended as an international standard saddled developing country producers and exporters with additional costs to meet disparate SPS measures on the same product in different markets .  
Targeted sanctions are a less blunt instrument than comprehensive sanctions , thereby minimizing humanitarian costs , the disruption of non-military trade , the likelihood of a black market emerging , additional humanitarian aid requirements and a negative impact on social infrastructures .  
Accelerating current initiatives and [ taking / adopting United States ] additional actions to reduce substantially the debts of [ developing countries , particularly United States would delete ] the heavily indebted low-income countries , [ by speeding up the process , by relaxing the eligibility criteria and by broadening and deepening / improving and enhancing existing measures within the current framework of Japan ] the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) initiative ;  
In view of the low level of voluntary contributions , the small proportion of the regular budget allocated to technical cooperation , and a fluctuating and inadequate operational budget , additional resources were urgently needed .  
This provides for the gradual phasing in of an additional 140 military observers , the establishment of a second-line medical capability with 35 medical personnel and the expansion of the Observer Mission by 59 international civilian and 21 local staff as well as for the required logistical support .  
Finally , the Council agreed that the international community has a key role to play in supporting efforts to eradicate poverty , promote productive employment and achieve gender equality , and that the mobilization of new and additional financial resources from all sources , national and international , is required .  
Call on the international community to provide effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21 , to support small island developing States [ , in particular the least developed amongst them ] in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ;  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
The European Union has expressed support for the creation of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East , and emphasized the importance of additional protocols to safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency as an effective measure to prevent nuclear proliferation and foster mutual confidence .  
The international community and its organizations and , in particular , the Conference on Disarmament , must make genuine endeavours to agree to an international convention on the prohibition of the production and use of depleted uranium for military purposes , and the existing international conventions relating to environmental protection must be strengthened by additional measures to deter parties from failing to respect environmental laws .  
The provision to the effect that the revenues and budgets of all physical and legal persons will be made in foreign currencies is along the same lines , as well as the paradoxical provision that a compulsory payment may be paid in dinars with a charge of " an additional administrative fee to cover handling and transaction costs " .  
Further , additional financial resources will be decentralized to country offices to provide greater flexibility in providing short advisory services to member States and to facilitate regular public and private sector policy dialogue .  
Member States are encouraged to continue supporting the efforts of the Office in this area and to provide additional financial resources as part of their contributions to the programme of advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights , to enable the Office to further extend its activities in support of Member States that request assistance in establishing national institutions and also to support such institutions in their work .  
UNDP / GEF seed resources will be matched by additional co-financing from the countries of the region and from bilateral and multilateral organizations directed towards the global FOCADES account or to specific thematic accounts .  
On that basis , the Secretary-General requested and obtained from the Advisory Committee a commitment authority in an amount not exceeding $ 1,897,300 gross ( $ 1,600,500 net ) to meet the revised phase I requirements of UNAMET for the additional month of September 1999 , pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 52 / 223 of 22 December 1997 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
While welcoming the Government 's proposed modest increase in the target caloric value of the food basket to 2,200 kilocalories per person per day , in view of the additional funds available , the Secretary-General recommends that the caloric value of the food basket should be increased at the minimum to 2,300 kilocalories per person per day country-wide , which was the level approved for the enhanced distribution plan for phase IV ( S / 1998 / 446 ) .  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
In April 1998 , the Interim Committee proposed a broadening of SDDS , so that the system would also cover additional financial data such as net reserves ( after allowance for central banks liabilities under forward or derivative transactions ) , the debt ( in particular the short-term debt ) of economic agents and other indicators bearing on the stability of the financial sector .  
Owing to the location of the Tribunal headquarters , an effective and safe communications infrastructure is essential for the Tribunal staff at different locations : pouch services ; an enhanced satellite communications service including the Internet ; additional telephone / fax lines to distribute incoming documents on urgent and confidential matters more quickly and safely ; and for connecting an additional number of off-site locations to the central system . 
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
Moreover , the subsequent establishment and effective functioning of related organs such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea constituted an additional and specialized forum for the peaceful settlement of disputes in parallel with the International Court of Justice .  
Providing organizations the opportunity to indicate whether they could absorb the costs of the activities being requested within current and / or successive programmes of work and budget , or whether such activities could only be carried out if additional financing was provided , would avoid the risk of diversion of resources or staff time from the programme of work and budget approved by its governing bodies , while contributing to more consistent and coherent governance by Member States .  
The main suggestions and recommendations made were as follows : ( a ) the digital image processing and GIS parts of the programme should be expanded ; ( b ) additional training in advanced technologies and microwave remote sensing would be useful in order to enable participants to improve educational curricula in their respective institutions ; and ( c ) access to satellite images and teaching materials should be improved .

He also drew attention to some remaining difficulties such as the possible additional resources that Conference Services would need for the editing , translation and printing of the supplement , the heavy burden that the concentration of the review work within a single division would place on that division and the priority to be given to other urgent responsibilities in the current period of financial crisis and diminishing resources .

The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .

In view of the politico-economic environment in which well over half the 1995 expenditure was incurred , it is still considered that the additional resources , both human and financial , which would be required to analyse and forecast the inflation and exchange rate variation factors with any degree of reliability would be costly to UNHCR , the degree of reliability would most probably not be reached , and the added value to UNHCR would most probably be minimal .

Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .

Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,

The idea was also raised that building up a domestic institutional investor base could help provide additional local private demand for marketable securities .  
At the national level , review arrangements , such as the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups , organized by the least developed countries with the support of the respective organizations , have been further consolidated during the early 1990s , with additional countries joining or rejoining the process and meetings taking place more frequently and on a more regular basis .

Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
During the same period , in 1994 , additional work and project changes were requested by ECA , which , inter alia , included electrical , mechanical and special system requirements such as additional and uninterruptible power supply , building automated control system and anti-intrusion security .

While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
Paragraph 4 indicated that the net reduction of $ 25.1-million reflected the combined effect of projected additional requirements of $ 31.6-million due to changes in inflation assumptions , commitments entered into under resolution 50 / 217 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses and commitments authorized by the General Assembly ; a $ 28.7-million decrease in income ; and an anticipated reduction of $ 85.4-million due to changes in exchange rate assumptions , variations in post and common staff costs and adjustments to objects of expenditure other than posts .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
Similarly , it is recognized that implementation of the Summit 's Declaration and Programme of Action will require the mobilization of financial resources at the national and international levels and that the specific cases of Africa and the least developed countries will need additional resources and more effective development cooperation and assistance .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
The attention of the Commission is also drawn to Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 295 of 24 July 1996 , by which the Council , taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1996 / 111 of 23 April 1996 , decided to authorize , if possible within existing financial resources , 40 fully serviced additional meetings , including summary records , in accordance with rules 29 and 31 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , for the Commission 's fifty _ third session .  
Projections regarding future water demand and availability are highly uncertain , being dependent on assumptions about population and economic growth , investment in additional water supply , relative demand from different consuming sectors , the development and adoption of new technologies and the extent to which existing supplies become contaminated .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
The main objectives of chapter 33 of Agenda 21 are ( a ) to establish measures concerning financial resources and mechanisms for the implementation of Agenda 21 ; ( b ) to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable ; and ( c ) to seek the full use and continuing qualitative improvement of funding mechanisms to be utilized for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Given the current scarcity of public resources , additional funds need to be mobilized through increased use of economic instruments ( general tax reforms , eco-taxes , subsidy reduction and tradeable permit schemes ) , increased private-sector involvement , national environmental funds and innovative international financial mechanisms .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
The Secretary-General has the honour to submit to the Council for confirmation , pursuant to rule 11 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , an additional name of a representative of the member of the functional commission listed below that has been received since the close of the organizational session for 1996 .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
The emergence of an active biochemical prospecting market can provide an additional means of converting the potential future value of biodiversity into current income for those most responsible for , and most affected by , the preservation of biologically diverse ecosystems .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
The subsequent report provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas and contribute to the achievement of national objectives , ensures coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors and sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
Contributing to the total additional requirements of $ 162,600 under the meal and accommodation budget line item were daily subsistence allowance payments to military contingent personnel ( $ 16,700 ) recorded in part , under this budget line item ( see para . 10 below ) , and charges for meal allowance paid in the preceding mandate period ( $ 48,600 ) .  
A thorough assessment by the IPTF Commissioner has now determined that in order to carry out , in a satisfactory manner , the additional and existing tasks relating to human rights investigation , monitoring of the local police , strengthening of police training , police restructuring and the development of guidelines for democratic principles , IPTF will have to move from a police force with primarily generalist functions to one with a substantial number of police experts in specialized fields .  
Negotiations for the replenishment of GEF will have special importance for its future work , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national levels .  
While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
United Nations observations conducted in 87 schools and a detailed infrastructure survey by UNICEF in mid-1997 of an additional 150 schools showed a severe shortage of desks , resulting in an average of four pupils sharing a desk for two and approximately 50 per cent of the students sitting on the floor , lack of teaching aids , buildings in dilapidated condition and a lack of operational water and sanitation facilities .  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in support of national efforts in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Another school of thought , while recognizing the responsibility of the State to protect those living in its territory , held that the international community should also hold private individuals who perpetrated violence accountable , under the Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions , especially Protocol II , and that ethical and legal position had been gaining ground . 
The Advisory Committee was not satisfied with the explanation of the overrun of $ 462,500 under budget line " International contractual personnel " and was informed , upon inquiry , that although the actual deployment of such personnel in UNPF was lower than anticipated ( which resulted in savings of $ 1,788,100 ) , payments for overtime and commutation of leave resulted in additional expenditures of $ 1,857,400 , exceeding the saving by $ 69,300 .  
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on the operational requirements that necessitated the increase in troops over the authorized level and was informed that the average troop strength exceeded authorized strength by 166 in May 1996 and by 132 in June 1996 owing to the fact that the repatriation of the former UNCRO engineering battalion had to be postponed to the end of June 1996 , since engineering support was needed to complete the installation of military camps . 
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on the proposed requirements of $ 1.1-million for claims and adjustments under budget line 10 , " Supplies and services " , and was informed that the requirements were estimated at the same monthly rate ( $ 91,000 ) as in the initial cost estimates contained in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 and that , as at 2 April 1997 , a total of 78 third-party liability claims amounting to $ 400,000 had been received by UNTAES .  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on the agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's request for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ third sessions , decided , without a vote :  
In this connection , some Governments have argued that the acceptance of gratis personnel performing mandated activities would not , therefore , involve additional financial liability for the Organization since support costs have already been included in the budgets ; this argument is valid only if the gratis personnel are to be considered a substitute for staff to be recruited against authorized posts for the implementation of the approved activities .  
Although the Advisory Committee appreciated that the overall level of peacekeeping activity would decline as more and more missions were liquidated , it had concluded that there were a number of shortcomings in the Secretariat 's analysis of the workload of peacekeeping missions , for it had had difficulty relating the Secretary-General 's proposals for net additional posts to the actual or projected workload .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .

If the number of candidates obtaining such majority is less than the number of persons or delegations to be elected , there shall be additional ballots to fill the remaining places , the voting being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in the previous ballot , to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled , provided that , after the third inconclusive ballot , votes may be cast for any eligible person or delegation .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
Accordingly , the developing countries committed themselves to doing everything to preserve and protect the environment , while the developed countries , beyond their ecological obligations , were to provide new and additional financial resources in order to create an international economic environment conducive to the struggle against poverty .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
The implementation of the programmes as planned requires additional resources , which to an extent the Government of Lebanon has been forthcoming to make available through cost _ sharing ; a similar effort is required through increased mobilization of resources from bilateral donors and international institutions for United Nations system _ supported national programmes .

Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
As established in Agenda 21 , the global partnership for sustainable development must be based on the transfer of new and additional resources to developing countries to meet their immense needs and enable them to achieve sustainable development .  
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .

In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
The assessment provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas to contribute to the achievement of national objectives and , by ensuring coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors , sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
Such a situation would create additional pressure on developing countries , including small island developing States , to meet their growing domestic demand for fish as food on the one hand a problem likely to be aggravated by declining productivity of coastal fisheries due to coral reef degradation , as previously discussed and to increase their share of international markets on the other .  
The Controller had informed the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in a letter dated 26 September 1997 that the cost of a few additional officers specialized in political , civil and legal affairs would be provided under general temporary assistance ( equivalent to 1 P-5 , 2-P-4 , 2 General Service and 1 Field Service ) from within approved resources .

The Assembly decided that the preliminary estimate of resources for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 should therefore include a provision for special political missions , in the amount of $ 86.2-million at revised 19981999 rates , which should be reflected in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 ; and that additional requirements shall continue to be treated in accordance with the provisions of Assembly resolution 41 / 213 .  
The Committee also recommended that efforts be intensified in order to establish a vigorous plan of increased mobilization of resources directed at the eradication of poverty , economic development , substantial reduction of debt , institution of partnership innovations , market access and trade opportunities , mobilization of domestic resources and allocation of additional resources .  
Upon instructions from my Government and further to my previous letters , the latest dated 5 October 1998 ( A / 53 / 460-S / 1998 / 917 ) I have the honour to bring to your attention the following additional documented information regarding the continuous and systematic plundering of the religious , historical and cultural identity of the Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus .  
The selection and management of additional protected forest areas should be based on their value as representative or unique forest types ; their potential to generate information on ecological processes ; the conservation of biological diversity and ecosystem services ; and due consideration to the livelihoods of the communities depending on them .  
If , for those reasons , such specific form requirements were to remain outside the scope of the Uniform Rules , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be further clarified , possibly in the context of draft article B . The Working Group agreed that discussion as to that issue might need to be reopened at a later stage . 
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continuing coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross-purposes ;  
Even the initial analysis of the recommendations and proposals made by several United Nations bodies and mechanisms active in the field of human rights makes it possible to single out a number of major themes that could be considered by the World Conference with a view to formulating recommendations for the adoption of additional measures to combat racism at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Peruvian Government , for its part , considered that the World Conference should formulate concrete recommendations making it possible to increase the effectiveness of existing machinery used to combat racial discrimination and to adopt additional measures at the national , regional and international levels to strengthen those already in place .  
In order for developing countries to create an environment that would make it possible for everyone to attain quality education , a high standard of health and access to safe water the international community should support all the efforts currently being made by providing additional resources , enhancing debt reduction mechanisms , improving terms of trade and increasing the flow of foreign direct investment .

Considers intolerable that more than 800-million people , especially women and children , throughout the world , and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas ;  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
The resources proposed reflect a net growth of $ 701,400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .

At its 60th meeting , on 28 April 1999 , the Commission on Human Rights , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on its agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's requests for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ fifth session , decided , without a vote : 
The Committee congratulates the Government for the high level and large size of its delegation , headed by the Permanent Representative to the United Nations , which established a constructive , open and sincere dialogue with members of the Committee , and in its oral presentation gave additional specific and objective information as well as statistical data enabling the Committee to understand the de jure and de facto situation of Algerian women .  
The Committee expresses its appreciation to the Government of Thailand for its candid and comprehensive report , a supplementary report , as well as the additional information and written responses to the numerous questions put forward by the pre-session working group , as well as the clear responses provided in the oral presentation made by the representative of Thailand .  
Requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of funds from the regular budget or extrabudgetary resources , to arrange for additional meetings to be scheduled for negotiation of the protocols , with a view to enhancing the potential for the expeditious and simultaneous completion of the convention against transnational organized crime and the protocols thereto ;  
Pursuant to resolution 1201 ( 1998 ) , by which the Security Council mandated MINURCA to support the conduct of legislative elections in the Central African Republic in November and December 1998 , operational plans developed by MINURCA called for the deployment for a period of 2.5 months of an additional 21 international and 18 local staff , 94 medium and short-term electoral observers and for the provision of related additional air , transportation and communications assets .  
The GEF with its focus on additional concessional funding to meet incremental costs of projects of global benefits in the four focal areas of climate change , biological diversity , the ozone layer and international waters has a special and growing role .  
Moreover , although related costs for international salaries and common staff costs were calculated on the basis of 50 per cent of staff on appointments of limited duration , mission appointees ranged from 75 to 80 per cent of the total , contributing to additional savings under civilian personnel costs . 
The unencumbered balance of $ 4,571,900 gross ( $ 4,275,100 net ) resulted from reduced requirements as follows : military personnel costs ( $ 83,000 ) , civilian personnel costs ( $ 4,368,400 ) , operational costs ( $ 2,247,300 ) and staff assessment ( $ 296,800 ) ; these were offset by additional requirements amounting to $ 2,423,600 as follows : other programmes ( $ 19,300 ) and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ( $ 2,404,300 ) ( A / 53 / 908 , annex II ) .  
Thus , the international community , especially the United Nations , must step up its activities to end the humanitarian suffering of the victims of the situation and of those States that have sheltered a large number of refugees and displaced persons , thereby assuming a significant additional material and logistical burden .  
In conclusion , the Committees proposal for an additional regular session to be held in New York is driven by a commitment to the interdependence and indivisibility of all rights , as well as a recognition of the renewed interest in economic , social and cultural rights which is evident in the work of the United Nations human rights system .  
The Secretary-General may , in exceptional and compelling circumstances , authorize a reasonable increase in the travel subsistence allowance to be paid to a staff member who is required to accompany a senior official and whose official duties while in travel status require that his or her additional living expense be established at a rate substantially higher than that contemplated in setting the allowance rate for his or her level .

The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list , in the light of additional information that may become available , for the purposes of identifying items that are subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .  
An entire new cluster of WHO technical programmes has also been established to promote health in the context of sustainable human development , including a renewed emphasis on reducing malnutrition and improving management of environmental risks to human health , integrating health dimensions into poverty reduction programmes and protecting vulnerable populations in situations of crisis and post-crisis ; promoting the synergy between health and human rights constitutes an additional priority .  
The Group of Experts was aware that an efficient and effective revenue administration can help developing countries and transitional economies to mobilize additional revenue resources and achieve greater financial self-reliance in facilitating and achieving sustainable economic development .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .
