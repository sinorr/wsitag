Four years ago the villagers of Ssumakussu found a grove of sacred red cypress trees , the largest of which required a chain of 20 people to encircle it . The tree resembles a giant whose powerful arms are raised and open , and its discoverer , neighborhood chief Tseng Chen-chuan , has named it " Ta Lao Ye , " which means " big old gentleman . "  
Kwong Chi-hung , general manager of the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company , believes that only technical adjustments will be needed in textbooks to cope with political changes . Phrases that smack of colonialism can be altered . For example , the Chinese title of the highest ranking official can be changed from zongdu ( a term corresponding to the English title " governor , " but which in Chinese carries the feeling of " viceroy " or " imperial official " ) to " chief executive . "  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
Li describes a six-hour procedure in which he participated : The patient was suffering from a malignant tumor on the common bile duct , which connects to the hepatic duct , bile duct , and pancreatic duct . Because it affected so many organs , the surgery was extremely difficult . Seven persons-the assistant chief of the hospital , a chief resident , a resident , an anesthe-siologist , and three nurses-labored for those six hours to complete the job .  
Chen Chienchun , chief chef for vegetarian dishes , points out that not only do fungi have a fresh and distinct taste , they are very nutritious , and many rare types effectively promote longevity .

In looking toward all of the preparations for the handover , those relating to government-including the establishment of the Basic Law and the holding of elections , the building of the airport , and even the appointment of the special administrative region 's chief executive and the arrival of the People 's Liberation Army-all have been accomplished . People 's private responses to the turnover-including the rush to get second passports , the return flow of emigrants , the real-estate boom-these too have already happened . Will there be big changes in the future ?  
In the days leading up to the takeover , one periodically reads of incoming chief executive Tung Chee-hwa admonishing Hong Kong people : Confucian culture must be strengthened , civic education is very valuable , family values must be reconstructed .  
According to Hsieh Shun-ching 's analysis , increasing grain production is of chief importance in the African and Southern Pacific regions ; raising the overall level of " agricultural-entrepreneurial development " in the agricultural industry is most important in Southeast Asia ; for the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean , the most numerous group , the key to development is crops that possess either high economic value or export potential .  
For the Rukai , living at the foot of the mountains , land belonged to the tribal chief , who was responsible for looking after the old and weak . But hunting land rights were determined by general agreement .

Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .  
The economic basis of the Li clan 's livelihood had been laid down by Li Qingshui 's gradually buying up a huge area of farmland , but because the family suffered harassment from local tyrants , the seven brothers of the third generation decided to support the naturally gifted Li Shuhua , to allow him to devote himself completely to study . Shuhua really did pass the imperial examinations , and later became chief examining officer for the initial xiucai grade civil service exams for the whole of Taiwan .  
In order to achieve its new goals , the PRC has been buying or developing ( with the help of hired Russian experts ) SU-27 fighters , inter-continental ballistic missiles , and cruise missiles , and is forming a naval task force capable of independent operational capability . General Tang Fei , chief of the ROC general staff , judges that there are a number of objectives behind the PRC 's transformation of its military strategy .  
The chief culprit is suspected to be poor drainage at a disused military firing range on top of the hill . The Shihlin District Prosecutor 's Office is carrying out an investigation , and has not ruled out other possible causes , such as illegal logging , or that the drainage system for the whole area is inadequate .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
Whether lower-level measures related to localization of government can be implemented smoothly remains to be seen . These lower-level measures include the consensus reached by the National Development Conference on downsizing the TPG , making the jobs of village chief and township chief into positions appointed by the central government rather than elected by the public , and ending elections for village and township councils . Many are worried that parochialism may become more apparent when tasks that were originally handled by the TPG are handed over to local governments .  
With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government . In 1967 , the city of Taipei came under the direct jurisdiction of the central government , whereas before it had been under the provincial government . In cities under the provincial government , the chief administrators of municipal districts , who had formerly been chosen by direct elections , also began to be appointed . The locals rule  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
If a big clan lived in a traditional compound centered around their own courtyard , anyone that was sick or out of work could recuperate under the protective wings of the extended family , " says Taipei County deputy chief Lin Wan-yi , who is currently planning the county 's social welfare system . Within a single generation , the functions of the family declined greatly .  
In his Master 's thesis entitled War and the Taiwanese , Li Kuo-sheng states that the system first appeared after the January 28th Incident of 1932 , when the Japanese attempted unsuccessfully to invade the lower Yangtze valley from their concession in Shanghai . Okamura Yasuji , chief of staff of the Japanese Imperial Army , was anxious to bring an end to the endless patronizing of local prostitutes by Japanese soldiers . To this end he ordered the establishment of military " comfort stations " where the soldiers could take care of their sexual needs .  
Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
When senior Macau officials are asked about having studied in Taiwan , they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in Macau , Lisbon , or mainland China . " It 's called sanitizing your record ! " quips Tan Zhiqiang , Hong Kong and Macau bureau chief for the China Times , who was born and raised in Macau and wrote his doctoral dissertation on " The Question of Macau 's Sovereignty . "  
The whole time they have been putting forth competing policy proposals , Soong and the KMT have been engaged in a furious behind-the-scenes struggle to win the allegiance of local politicos who wield great influence over voting at the grassroots level . The Chung Hsing Bills scandal has brought Soong nothing but bad news on this front . Heavyweight politicians who had been sitting the fence have now returned to the KMT fold , including Hakka leader Wu Poh-hsiung and Yunlin 's county chief Chang Jung-wei .  
Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course . After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience . Unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in Taiwan . Thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
On April 24 the National Assembly finalized the chief task of the sixth round of constitutional revisions during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency : its own demobilization .

In particular , the group lambasted the government for the NT $ 200 million it had spent in vain on a reconstruction plan designed by academics that was impossible to implement . They argued that the new government 's chief concerns should instead be with practical measures such as instituting work management controls and tracking down how reconstruction money was embezzled after the quake . It called upon the government to put an end to the tradition of plans that are unfeasible and good for nothing but creating a lot of hot air .  
" The approach adopted now at chinatimes.com is to integrate a number of e-papers and mail these out to members .

By working with businesses , treating the e-paper platform as a giant shopping center , and using integrated operations , not only can a news-oriented e-paper survive , its professional reputation can be a guarantee of reliability to consumers .  
" As far as the explosive power of volcanoes goes , the lava eruption was much more moderate , " says Tsao Shuh-jong , section chief of the Division of Original Geology in the Central Geological Survey . In addition , basaltic lava has a relatively low silicon dioxide content , so it is correspondingly less sticky . Flowing basalt thus forms very different shapes from the lava of a typical volcanic eruption .  
Li Tung-liang , a director of the Chaoyang Lukang Association , points out that in the early years of the Guangxu reign period ( 1871-1908 ) of the Qing dynasty , the Quanzhou woodcarving master Li Ko-chiu moved to Lukang , where he gathered together all the local wood sculptors and organized a guild . Today , a century later , its namesake organization selects an annual chief organizer by casting for divination sticks ; this individual is then responsible for arranging the ceremony honoring Lu Ban .  
Academia Sinica professor Chen Kuo-tung , who served as chief editor of Leaves in the Wind , is quick to concede that the historical materials in the book have to be taken with a grain of salt , but argues that it makes a valuable contribution by bringing together scattered impressions of Taiwan that Westerners have had over a span of more than three centuries , thus giving local readers a chance to understand what their homeland has looked like to foreigners .  
But chief editor Chuang Hui-chiu has done a masterful job of just that , spinning a broad tapestry that shows the interplay between individual emotions and collective experience . This she achieves by inviting contributions from over 30 persons from all walks of life who have played prominent roles in the gay movement over the past decade . By allowing each writer their own individual perspective , the book avoids the difficulties of historiography while providing students of social movements with a rigorous yet creative presentation of the facts .

Vincent Hsieh , the chief operations officer ( COO ) at PC Home Online , which crossed over into online marketing three years ago , says that SARS definitely boosted Internet sales of things like surgical masks , thermometers , disinfectant , and air purifiers .

Therefore he thinks that online selling is attractive enough in itself that it will not experience any sharp falloff now that the epidemic is over .  
The Japanese faced fierce resistance in the early years of the colonial period , especially in the central and southern parts of the island . Many administrative orders went ignored outside of Taipei 's walled district where the colonial government was headquartered , and the post of governor-general changed hands in rapid succession .

The building housing today 's Taiwan Museum was originally built in memory of these two men .

" Falungong " is a cult .  This is not determined by the " will of the chief executive " , nor is it the central government 's subjective " decision " .  It is an iron-clad fact based on innumerable instances , and the conclusion is based on foreign governments ' legislation experiences .  
Long Yongtu , vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation and the ministry 's chief WTO negotiator , once flew into a rage over an unreasonable demand by some developed member nations that China protect its agricultural products at the 5 percent level , as do the developed countries .

As early as in the eighties , Deng Xiaoping , the chief architect of China 's reform and opening up program , already put forth the concept of coordinating the nation 's economic development .  According to the concept , central and western China should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .

Therefore , one of important tasks for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland was to find out a chief executive who truly loves the country and Hong Kong and who can shoulder the heavy duties at a historic turning point .  The election of Tung Chee-hwa was widely acclaimed by people at home and abroad as well as by people of the central government and the international community .  Hong Kong residents also are happy to have such a person as their chief executive .  
Under the main orientation of orderly and gradual development of Hong Kong 's democratic political system , the Basic Law lays down the method for producing the chief executive and legislative organs of the SAR , and there are clear regulations on the emergence and appointment of the chief executive and the leading officials .

The Central Discipline Committee heard " two fixes " confession of standing deputy governor of Hebei Cong Fukui at the end of last month .  
It is reported that provincial State Administration of Taxation bureau chief Li Zhen and two other deputy bureau chiefs are involved in bribery , tax evasion , money laundering in China and overseas , and other economic crimes .

The chief justice will directly sign the final document according to the law .  
The selection of the chief justice will be conducive to building a contingent of high quality judges and establishing a scientific judge system .  According to open , equal , competitive and selective principles , outstanding judges of high quality will be selected and appointed as the chief justice .  
The chief justice will receive a special allowance according to the regulations and special consideration in time of promotion .  The system can thus create favorable conditions for enabling high quality judges to be discovered and become eminent .  It will fully whip up the working enthusiasm of all judicial personnel , enhance their interests in work and sense of responsibility , and also have a positive influence on improving the quality of all judges .  
According to the law , in the trial of a legal case , the principle of the minority being subordinate to the majority should be followed .  The chief justice can not use his own opinion to replace the opinion of the majority of members of the collegial panel .  When there is a major difference between the chief justice and other members of the collegial panel , the matter should be reported to the court president for discussion and final judgment by the judicial council .  
It is a complicated and long-term task to correctly appraise the social situation and the will of the people .  The SAR Government and all people loving the country and Hong Kong must build firm confidence .

The chief executive and the SAR Government have done substantial and effective work .  Local economic discovery is under way .  Our society is now stable and united .

This bloody self-immolation further proved that " Falungong " is an out-and-out cult bearing all the characteristics of cults in the world , such as demanding absolute loyalty to the cult chief , fabricating antiscientific fallacies , exercising spiritual control over their followers , having mysterious and strict organization , being strongly exclusive and antisocial , irregularly spreading the " theory of world 's doomsday , " and creating the tragedy of " rise to heaven for full accomplishment . "  
The appointment of Donald Tsang , who is familiar with government operations , as chief secretary for administration , and the appointment of Antony Leung , who is a member of the Executive Council and a financier , as financial secretary , however , avoided a great change in the positions of senior officials , and showed the possibility of bringing qualified people in the private sector into the civil service system , thus strengthening the government .  The appointments are laudable .  
While acting as the financial secretary , he personally understood the principle of " one country , two systems " was fully put into effect , and thus enhanced his faith in serving the SAR Government and contributing to the implementation of the principle .  On the recommendation of the chief executive , the State Council appointed Donald Tsang as chief secretary for administration to coordinate government operations and lead 180,000 civil servants .  
It has been proven by facts in the entire process , chief executive Tung Chee-hwa , the SAR government , central institutions stationed in Hong Kong , and people from all circles have never doubted and criticized the nature and activities of other religions .  On the contrary , they have recommended upright religious activities as positive forces for stabilizing the society and guiding people toward benevolence .  
At a time when Donald Tsang Yam-kuen is about to be relieved of his post as financial secretary and to take up a more important new post as chief secretary for administration , the Hong Kong people should commend his performance since Hong Kong 's return to China and should hope the principle of prudently handling financial affairs and keeping expenditures within the limits of revenue enshrined in the Basic Law will continue to be implemented and developed in the financial work of the special administrative region in the future .

Taking into account comments of the Bills Committee and the Hong Kong Association of Banks , as the amended definition of " manager " may be inconsistent with the existing penalty provision , we propose to clarify the provision to the effect that any reference in this Ordinance to the commission of an offence for which every director , chief executive or manager of an authorized institution shall be held liable means that one or more than one of any such person may be prosecuted .

However as I said earlier , the HKMA may , in certain cases , complete the vetting and approval process of senior management changes in banks within a few days .  The time required in the case of BOC Hong Kong 's chief executive post was about the same as that required in similar cases .

But the historical drama played out on this beautiful stage during the following century , in which the chief actors were the Chinese , the Dutch , the Spanish , and the Japanese , has nearly vanished into the mists of antiquity .

Television is the chief adversary of radio among the broadcast media , but surveys reveal that the most popular radio presenter over the last two years has been Lo Hsiao-yun , whose program Intimate Listening airs six evenings a week from eight to ten o'clock - - which happens to be television 's prime time .  
Wu Kuang-ting , for many years secretary of overseas Chinese affairs at the ROC embassy , explains : " There are three such chief justices in Panama , each nominated by the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government respectively .

Capt . Wang Feng-tien , chief of the supervisory office for second-generation warships says : " The weaponry and electronic warfare systems aboard a warship are varied and complicated . Everything has to be more precise than on merchant ships , from pipe-fitting to welding .

Hung Chia-li , a matchmaker at the I Hsuan Agency , says that some women deliberately " downgrade " themselves on their personal information cards , changing a master 's degree to a bachelor 's degree or a bureau chief position to a section head , because they 're afraid of scaring men off . Statistics show that more than half of all women with a college education or higher have married husbands less well educated than they are .  
Wang Hsing-ching observes that most people are far less ready to accept an aboriginal at the head of an administration than as a councillor , provincial assembly member or other elected representative , " for such representatives only represent their minority community , but the local chief executive represents a whole county or city , including the Han Chinese as well as the ' native people . ' '  
A learning processNevertheless , despite the fact that doctors were indeed respected in the Japanese occupation era , and in the old society local gentry always had the obligation to play a role in determining public policy , under the Japanese local elites only had the opportunity to occupy low level administrative posts like neighborhood chief , assistant , or secretary , or else the nominal " assemblymen " at various levels who had no power to pass legislation or even resolutions .  
The section chief of the division for agricultural weather forecasts , Liu Fu-cheng , nicknamed " the old turtle , " has known Jen Li-yu for thirty years as classmate , fellow conscript , and colleague .

After being returned to China , Taiwan was kept apart and given a special status because the mainland had not returned to a state of normalcy . Administration was placed in the hands of a single " hsing-cheng chang-kuan " appointed by the central government . This term is generally rendered into English as " governor , " but its literal translation is " chief executive official . " Meanwhile , other aspects of life in Taiwan - - such as the currency , rationing , and so on - - were also different from the mainland .  
Community chief Tseng Chen-chuan describes how in the past , when village elders were happily drunk , they would sing a traditional ballad recounting tribal history , the gist of which was : " Our ancestors were born from the rocks , and came here from their place of origin on the other side of Tapachien Mountain . Ssumakussu was the first place they made home on the north side of the mountain , and when the population of the tribe increased they branched out to Hsiuluan , Tienpu , Hsinkuang and elsewhere . "  
Four years ago the villagers of Ssumakussu found a grove of sacred red cypress trees , the largest of which required a chain of 20 people to encircle it . The tree resembles a giant whose powerful arms are raised and open , and its discoverer , neighborhood chief Tseng Chen-chuan , has named it " Ta Lao Ye , " which means " big old gentleman . "  
Kwong Chi-hung , general manager of the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company , believes that only technical adjustments will be needed in textbooks to cope with political changes . Phrases that smack of colonialism can be altered .

"  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
Li describes a six-hour procedure in which he participated : The patient was suffering from a malignant tumor on the common bile duct , which connects to the hepatic duct , bile duct , and pancreatic duct . Because it affected so many organs , the surgery was extremely difficult .

Chen Chienchun , chief chef for vegetarian dishes , points out that not only do fungi have a fresh and distinct taste , they are very nutritious , and many rare types effectively promote longevity .

In looking toward all of the preparations for the handover , those relating to government-including the establishment of the Basic Law and the holding of elections , the building of the airport , and even the appointment of the special administrative region 's chief executive and the arrival of the People 's Liberation Army-all have been accomplished . People 's private responses to the turnover-including the rush to get second passports , the return flow of emigrants , the real-estate boom-these too have already happened . Will there be big changes in the future ?

According to Hsieh Shun-ching 's analysis , increasing grain production is of chief importance in the African and Southern Pacific regions ; raising the overall level of " agricultural-entrepreneurial development " in the agricultural industry is most important in Southeast Asia ; for the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean , the most numerous group , the key to development is crops that possess either high economic value or export potential .  
For the Rukai , living at the foot of the mountains , land belonged to the tribal chief , who was responsible for looking after the old and weak .

Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .  
The economic basis of the Li clan 's livelihood had been laid down by Li Qingshui 's gradually buying up a huge area of farmland , but because the family suffered harassment from local tyrants , the seven brothers of the third generation decided to support the naturally gifted Li Shuhua , to allow him to devote himself completely to study . Shuhua really did pass the imperial examinations , and later became chief examining officer for the initial xiucai grade civil service exams for the whole of Taiwan .  
In order to achieve its new goals , the PRC has been buying or developing ( with the help of hired Russian experts ) SU-27 fighters , inter-continental ballistic missiles , and cruise missiles , and is forming a naval task force capable of independent operational capability . General Tang Fei , chief of the ROC general staff , judges that there are a number of objectives behind the PRC 's transformation of its military strategy .  
The chief culprit is suspected to be poor drainage at a disused military firing range on top of the hill . The Shihlin District Prosecutor 's Office is carrying out an investigation , and has not ruled out other possible causes , such as illegal logging , or that the drainage system for the whole area is inadequate .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
Whether lower-level measures related to localization of government can be implemented smoothly remains to be seen . These lower-level measures include the consensus reached by the National Development Conference on downsizing the TPG , making the jobs of village chief and township chief into positions appointed by the central government rather than elected by the public , and ending elections for village and township councils . Many are worried that parochialism may become more apparent when tasks that were originally handled by the TPG are handed over to local governments .  
With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government . In 1967 , the city of Taipei came under the direct jurisdiction of the central government , whereas before it had been under the provincial government . In cities under the provincial government , the chief administrators of municipal districts , who had formerly been chosen by direct elections , also began to be appointed . The locals rule  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
If a big clan lived in a traditional compound centered around their own courtyard , anyone that was sick or out of work could recuperate under the protective wings of the extended family , " says Taipei County deputy chief Lin Wan-yi , who is currently planning the county 's social welfare system . Within a single generation , the functions of the family declined greatly .  
In his Master 's thesis entitled War and the Taiwanese , Li Kuo-sheng states that the system first appeared after the January 28th Incident of 1932 , when the Japanese attempted unsuccessfully to invade the lower Yangtze valley from their concession in Shanghai . Okamura Yasuji , chief of staff of the Japanese Imperial Army , was anxious to bring an end to the endless patronizing of local prostitutes by Japanese soldiers . To this end he ordered the establishment of military " comfort stations " where the soldiers could take care of their sexual needs .  
Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
When senior Macau officials are asked about having studied in Taiwan , they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in Macau , Lisbon , or mainland China .

" quips Tan Zhiqiang , Hong Kong and Macau bureau chief for the China Times , who was born and raised in Macau and wrote his doctoral dissertation on " The Question of Macau 's Sovereignty . "  
The whole time they have been putting forth competing policy proposals , Soong and the KMT have been engaged in a furious behind-the-scenes struggle to win the allegiance of local politicos who wield great influence over voting at the grassroots level . The Chung Hsing Bills scandal has brought Soong nothing but bad news on this front . Heavyweight politicians who had been sitting the fence have now returned to the KMT fold , including Hakka leader Wu Poh-hsiung and Yunlin 's county chief Chang Jung-wei .  
Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course . After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience . Unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in Taiwan . Thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .
