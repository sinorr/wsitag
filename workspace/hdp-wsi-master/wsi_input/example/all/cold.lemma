He Xiaohong , a senior engineer with the autonomous region 's meteorological bureau , said such weather phenomenon was formed due to a recent significant cold air current coming southward down from the north of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau . When it merged with the warm northward up current from the Indian Ocean between the Mount Nyainqentanglha and the Himalayas , rain or sleet was formed .  
After the end of the cold war , ASEAN confronted new international and regional situations and comprehensively adjusted its development strategy and foreign relations strategy , and increasingly became a cooperative organization in the southeast Asia region based on economic cooperation and integrating politics , economy and security .  
On the firing practice field , a group of soldiers in camouflage uniform quietly lied prostrate in the cold wind .  The three greenish black " Hongjian " antitank missiles settled on the missile-support strut stood straight up , alert and ready , and the warheads glared like a tiger at the white target several thousand meters away .  
As far as military strategy was concerned , the United States had adopted a new set of operational methods for high-technology limited warfare following the end of the cold war , but NATO 's operational methods and command systems had not departed completely from the operational approach designed for the prospect of fighting big battles with the Soviet Union . Therefore , there was a lack of coordination between them in the operations .  
In the agreement reached on the summit meeting , both sides reaffirmed the three major principles of independence , peaceful reunification , and great national unity , which are not only conducive to both sides improving relations through dialogue , to realizing reconciliation , and to ultimately realizing peaceful reunification , but also in accord with the current requirements of the times for peace and development and are conducive to dispelling the cloud of a cold war over the peninsula and to maintaining peace in northeast Asia .  
After the cold war ended , the U.S . military 's traditional opponent has gone out of existence .  Driven by its strategic need to assert sole hegemony over the globe with its " new cold-war thinking " and its narrow interest in expanding the increasingly shrinking survival space for military forces , the U.S . military has always been concocting a virtual opponent .  
It has made one innovation after another and has developed " tools for cooking and distributing hot foods " , " water filters for camp and field training " , " mobile barracks on vehicles " , and " oil heaters for cold areas on plateaus " .  It has laid a solid foundation for solving difficult problems that restrain long distance mobile support for the armed forces .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
In the 1990 ' s , after the end of the cold war , under international disarmament pressure and opposition from peace forces in Japan , Japan instituted the guideline of " reducing armaments on the one hand while improving the quality on the other " in its military building , and worked to build modern armed forces of " the right scale and ample quality . "  
Since the cold war , Japan has been more active in pursuing its diplomatic line in seeking to become a world political power ; in military affairs , therefore , it has gradually changed its relatively passive and inward-looking military strategy and army building guidelines of the cold war period , in order to shake off Japan 's international image as a country with imbalance of economic , political , and military status , in a bid to play a greater role in a multipolar world .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States has indeed enjoyed nearly 10 years of sustained economic growth , but in respect of citizens ' rights of existence , the gap between rich and poor in American society is growing and the population living in poverty is increasing .  
Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .  
They even slept near the door to fence off cold winds for their comrades .  In peaceful times , Party members took the lead in answering the call of the Party , executing Party lines and completing urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks .  
make proper arrangements for the basic livelihood of the people of disaster areas ; and make sure that earthquake victims will not suffer from hunger and cold and will receive medical treatment when falling ill , and epidemic diseases are prevented from occurring .  Efforts should be made to mobilize and organize cadres and the masses of the people to display the spirit of self-reliance and hard work , enthusiastically carry out self-help production projects , pull together tide over difficulties , resume production as quickly as possible , and prevent spring production from being neglected .  
The DPRK Nodong Sinmun published a commentary condemning the US-ROK joint military exercise as a " strategic provocation . "  It pointed out that the United States is attempting to continue to carry out its hostile policy of strangling the DPRK " by power , " and the US adventurist actions have poured cold water on the people of the Korean peninsula who earnestly desire national self-determination and reunification and a beautiful future .  
As the strategic turning point in China strategy , 1989 , the year when the Soviet Union broke up and the cold war ended [ as received ] , completely changed the status of US global strategy : Its powerful opponent collapsed overnight , and the United States , which was in the most favorable situation , very quickly started to change its China policy from " soft " to " pushing for change . "  
Seeing that the US MD plan was getting the cold shoulder throughout international society , with even NATO unable to reach unanimous agreement on supporting US implementation of the plan , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi hastened to make some major changes in his previous attitude , that the US missile plan was " very meaningful research . "  
In that period , China just witnessed the feudal dynasty 's surrendering of the nation 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the imperialist foreign powers ' despotic and domineering practice on its land , unceasing social turbulences , and the people 's miserable lives of suffering from hunger and cold . 
In the first 80-year period , the feudal rulers surrendered the country 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the whole society was thrown into utter chaos caused by wars , the country became impoverished and weak and the people lived in hunger and cold .  
Clinton handed over to Bush the quite good relationship with China which prevailed during the latter part of his presidency , but when Bush took office the majority of those he employed were Republican conservatives and cold warriors , and moreover they had been absent from the political arena for many years and their understanding of current world issues was markedly backward .  As a result US relations with many countries have become deadlocked in less than half a year after Bush took office .  
Still more important , following the reliable legal guarantee for all-round development of bilateral relations provided by the " Sino-Russian Treaty of Good neighborly Friendship and Cooperation , " a new page will be turned in this relationship in the new century , and in the face of the new-style state relations of mutual trust and benefit established by China and Russia , the disintegration strategy pushed by the sole superpower in combination with its cold war mentality unilateralism will be of no avail .  
The " Sino-Russian Treaty of Good neighborly friendship and Cooperation " sets down in legal form the aspirations and resolve of China and Russia to be forever good neighbors , good partners , and good friends , and totally discards the cold war mentality of being either in alliance or confrontation ; it is an expression of the new-style interstate relations of seeking security through trust and cooperation through mutual benefit , and is a programmatic document guiding the healthy and steady development of Sino-Russian relations in the new century .  
After the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia in 1991 , President Jiang Zemin and Russia 's first President Yeltsin profoundly summed up the experiences and lessons of history ; based on the strategic requirements of their countries ' national construction and development , and in accordance with the new characteristics and trends of changes in the international situation , they decided to establish a new style of interstate relationship completely different from the cold war period .  
Second , this treaty discards the old mentality and pattern of the cold war period by which interstate relations were either in alliance or confrontational , and has laid down for Sino-Russian relations the properties of being nonaligned , non-confrontational , and not being aimed at any third country , thus setting a good example for the international community in pursuing security through trust and cooperation through mutual benefit .  
After the trials of training in high temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius and frigid cold of 30 degrees Celsius below zero ; after successively moving across Bohai , Donghai , Nanhai , and other sea areas ; after undergoing rigid training and roughing it out , the Navy Marines of our army have now found an operational program that is suitable for moving , eating , living , and fighting in all kinds of weathers and environments under the condition of modern warfare .  They have also mastered the skill of fighting in complicated regions .  
This treaty makes long-term plans for Sino-Russian relations in the 21st century , and in particular lays down that the two parties will enduringly and comprehensively develop a strategic cooperation partnership of good neighborliness , friendship , cooperation , and trust as equals .  This treaty expresses in concentrated form the broad common interests of the two countries in bilateral relations and international affairs .  The treaty does away with the cold war mentality that interstate relations are either alliance or confrontation ;

In the first 80-year period , the feudal lords surrendered the country 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the whole society was thrown into utter chaos caused by wars , the country became impoverished and weak and the people lived in hunger and cold .  
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .

As a result of Kim T'ae-chung 's visit to North Korea as President , the North and South have formally acknowledged the objective existence of their respective independent political entities ; in addition , mentally redefining each other 's status is beneficial not only for easing antagonism and tension in their relationship but also for establishing a relationship of peaceful coexistence and replacing their cold war relations of more than 50 years with a new relationship of coexistence and common prosperity ;  
In the Drought Agriculture Ecology Laboratory , which is a key state project , a young professor gave Jiang Zemin an account of one of their scientific research achievements : In view of the unique drought and cold geographical conditions of the west region , Professor Zhao Songlin , the first director of the laboratory , proposed a brand new idea of developing " catchment type ecological agriculture , " which was successful in practice .  
What formed a sharp contrast to the election , which proceeded in an unprecedentedly intense way , was that diplomatic issues , particularly the China issue which became a hot issue in previous general elections , were unprecedentedly left out in the cold .  
After the cold war ended , South Korea 's comprehensive national strength has increased rapidly and popular indignation has been roused by the U.S . troops ' constant misdeeds and commitments of crimes against law .  There have been loud cries in South Korea for revision of this unequal agreement .  
A cold front developed to the north of Hong Kong and moved south on May 24 bringing heavy showers and squally thunderstorms to local areas .  
A cold front crossed the south China coastal areas on the morning of November 1 .  It brought a few rain patches to the New Territories . Winds strengthened from the north and the weather was mainly cloudy .  
He pointed out that since the 1980s , the HKO had been using solar energy to power remote automatic weather stations which helped to give early warnings on impending weather such as tropical cyclones , heavy rain , high wind and cold fronts .  
The two men under arrest , aged 33 and 47 , were subsequently charged with operating an unlicensed cold store , failing to keep the cold store clean and possession of prohibited food ( pork not from approved source ) for sale .  
A weak cold front arrived at the south China coastal areas on October 4 .  The weather in Hong Kong turned hazy at first and became cloudy with thundery showers in the afternoon .  Around 80 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over parts of the Lantau Island .  
The adults in general did not perceive the need for regular dental check-ups .  Most of them had experienced various oral health problems such as bad breath , bleeding gums , sensitivity to hot and cold , and pain that disturbed sleeping .  
In addition , prospective donors who have contracted common cold or have symptoms as upper respiratory tract infection , such as fever , running nose , sore threat and cough are reminded to postpone their blood donation until and after a full recovery .  
His lips were purple from the cold , his face bloodless , but his eyes shone with a fanatical ecstasy . At last the owner recognized the wild man before him as the person who ten days before had cared so much about the red glazed bottle .  
Some could tolerate the cold , but were not too tasty ; others were large and flavorful , but required a long maturation period . Scientists bred to achieve a hardy , plump , tasty , quick growing fish .  
If prepared well , the meat is juicy , tender , and delectable . Preparing crabs is not difficult . First clean two fresh crabs in cold water .  
Every winter it is first to face the seasonal winds which sweep in from the north . The accompanying cold and drizzle last until spring . With clothing that takes days to dry , bedding prone to mildew , shoes easily ruined and houses continually damp , Keelung 's residents are constantly reminded of the steady rainfall during these months .  
The geographic position of the island off the east coast of the Asian landmass places it in one of the main migratory flyways for countless bird species making their annual winter trips south from the cold lands of north Asia .  
A silver candle 's autumnal glow is cold on the painted screen . A small fan of light gauze flaps at the drifting fireflies . On the Heavenly Stairs the dim night is as cool as water . She lies and watches the stars of the Herdboy and the Weaving Girl .  
In the first , murderers and brigands are tied to a bronze pole filled with fire . The second contains Blade Mountain . Here those who blasphemed the Buddha or wantonly killed living creatures are forced to climb naked up a mountain of innumerable sharp swords . Punished in the last level , the hell of freezing cold , are husband-killers , adulterers , the unfilial , and those who urged others to gamble .  
The snake population is high in gem mining zones , partly because the residents try to co-exist with them , but mainly because snakes like to live where jade deposits are plentiful . An experienced miner explained that snakes prefer jade-laden stone habitats because the temperature remains cool in summer yet has residual warmth during cold spells .  
Generally speaking , the more exotic varieties an orchid raiser keeps , the more astonishing the amount of equipment required : since the orchids ca n't be too cold , too hot , too moist , too dry , too shady , or too sunlit , a full panoply of air conditioners , sunlamps , thermostats , mist sprayers , and whatnot is called for .  
In the social sciences , economics and public finance are the most promising departments , while the continued rise of the population 's median age will mean an increased demand for social workers to provide services for the elderly . However , limitations on the number of candidates who can pass the bar examinations make law a rather " cold " field .  
In the old section you 'll see students from Heidelberg University wearing thick coats and carrying bundles of books . They brave the cold December winds as they walk through the market district , which sells Italian leather , French perfumes , and mink coats . Then they take a sharp turn into a small red brick alley to a seventeenth century Gothic style building . Just behind the huge wooden doors the professor is getting ready for class .

Perhaps you experience continual pain in your mouth or nasal passage .  
Family doctor Tony Shieh says that the most direct way to reduce sexual stimulation is exercise , which lowers seminal vesicle activity , releases energy , and preempts blood from filling up the sex organ . Besides this , a cold shower before bed , light calisthenics , wearing loose-fitting underwear , avoiding a too-warm blanket , and keeping an active lifestyle to tire oneself out are all ways to help overcome excessive sexual desire .  
Springtime in the south of China has but a few days of warm sunlight and gentle breezes ; soon the weather turns cloudy or cold , burying that rare and precious fragrance .  
During the cold winter season it lost all its leaves , and only barren branches are left to wait for the spring . As I watch them , the withered branches seem especially strong and unyielding in the dark . Some of the branches bud early and are soon covered with tender green leaves , transparent , smooth and clean . The veins on each heart-shaped leaf are clear to the scrutiny of night .  
Among the cold plates . sung-hua t'ang-hsin p'i-tan [ sugar-coated preserved eggs ] has a soft and slippery texture that can be matched with crispy smoked fish , with tough and chewy beef tendon or pig 's knuckle , and with liquor-saturated chicken , shrimp , or the like , which are chewy but not too tough .  
But the people of Shantung are clever . They fry the bananas in cane syrup and chill them in cold water to make the syrup crisp . The person eating one gets a nice crisp feeling before biting into the soft inside , and the combination of textures makes for a peculiar but exquisite treat .  
As part of this way of thinking , Chinese people strive to maintain a balance within the individual between the forces of yin and yang ( the dual principles of male and female , or positive and negative ) , which have influenced the concepts of hot and cold in Chinese food and medicine .  
The theory of the " malignant / benign polarity " might sound reasonable enough , and the various traditional Chinese occult sciences based on it , such as geomancy ( examining this polarity in spatial terms ) or Chinese medicine 's concern with regulating cold and heat , may be backed by crystal clear logical argument .  
Firstly , the Yin &amp; Yang principles described in the I-ching ( Classic of Changes ) can indicate many polarities such as the sun &amp; moon , day &amp; night , light &amp; dark , motion &amp; rest , internal &amp; external , cold &amp; heat , hard &amp; soft , and male &amp; female .  
These combinations seem to accord with common sense , for instance wood " rules " the direction East because growing trees like the sunlight and the sun rises in the east . Metal similarly " rules " the West since metal is by nature cold and dead , and the west is the direction of the setting sun and the lack of light which spells etiolation for plant life .  
Except for the spring and fall ancestral sacrifices and grave sweeping on the Ch'ing-ming festival , few people go there . Just one elderly Japanese quietly accompanies these homesick spirits in the cold winter months longing for a wind from their native land to the south . The Chinese have a saying that " a fallen leaf wants to return to its roots . "  
With rust-proof steel , plate glass , and glossy flat faces that looked like they had been cleaved with a knife , these plate glass buildings , rising like giant mirrors into the clouds , marked a new milestone in construction techniques . They are perfect company for the cold , rational , progressive sense of the modern city .  
The angry answer comes back that it is society 's search for simplistic explanations that is the problem and that , at his age , the youth is just discovering what a cold , shallow , arrogant culture he lives in - - where the worth of human beings is rated on the basis of the square footage of their homes , their net incomes and exam results , rather than on love and dignity .  
The most popular food for new mothers in Taiwan is sesame oil chicken . Chicken is the most digestible form of high-protein meat , while sesame oil is rich in vitamin E , calcium and iron and is said to help the uterus contract and eliminate lochia , or the discharge of blood , tissue and mucus after childbirth . The two main seasonings in sesame oil chicken - - ginger and rice wine - - are supposed to remove cold from the body and stimulate circulation .  
In fact , in one famous district in central Taiwan , a builder once advertised that a building would be equipped with cold storage for garbage , only to find that once the building was completed , the residents were unwilling to foot the extra electricity charge .  
Researchers have endeavored to find the reasons why grey mullet production has been unstable in recent years . One important discovery is that although the cold water mass from the mainland heads south to Taiwan , if it is n't sustained , which is to say if it does n't come far enough south , then it wo n't be strong enough to get into that push-pull dynamic with the Kuroshio Current , so that the fish will not form into schools . "  
It seems that Taichung has now become the " great grey mullet harbor . " This is also related to the fact that the cold fronts have not been able to come further southward . Improvements in fishing gear over the past few years , such as two boats cooperating to create a single large trap , increasing the horsepower of fishing boat motors , and improvements in two-way radios , have enabled the work of catching the fish in winter , unattainable in recent years , to go along swimmingly in the warmer weather .  
When the R . O . C . film The Wedding Banquet won top honors at the Berlin Film Festival , another feast for film lovers was opening back home . The films on offer here were black and white : pure and clean , yet warm and sweet . After a spell of cold and wet weather , the sun finally shows his face .  
And on sweltering summer days , people gather here to enjoy the cool shade . True , when that hard and cold cement road was paved just beyond the reach of its roots , it was a little uncomfortable , but for the most part it had nothing much to complain about . Enjoying largely mild weather , it has dug its roots deep and firm .  
Bob Yeh , managing director of the Meta Advertising Company , which handles the account for Shin Shii oolong tea , analyzes the reasons for failure at that time : First , Chinese who had long been accustomed to taking their tea hot could not immediately accept cold tea . There was a traditional belief that " tea left overnight produces poisons . " If tea is left to steep for a long time , it creates tannic acid , which causes the arteries to contract and makes digestion difficult .  
Fresh Pu'er tea is held by the Han people to be " bitter and cold . " Nonetheless , the minorities , with their sturdy physiques , usually just roast the leaves slightly , steep the tea and partake . Because of this , people who search the mountainous areas of Yunnan for genuine aged Pu'er are often greatly disappointed .  
Some calculating employees could tell that my husband was n't completely in support of me . To my surprise , they conspired to make my standing worse . Sometimes in public with a lot of people around , my husband scolded me , and after he left the room the employees treated my with a cold , haughty air .  
The hard-won joys of bird photographyPhotographing the black-faced spoonbill is arduous work . To avoid disturbing the birds , one must set up a hide in their habitat . Crouching in the camouflaged tent or wading through the black fetid mud with the cold seawater chilling one to the bone , exposed to the force of the bitter northeast wind , is something which is hard to describe with mere words to someone who has not experienced it himself .  
And so Chinese medicinal ingredients are rarely employed by themselves in singular attacks on a germ or ailment . Instead ingredients in prescriptions play one of four different roles : " monarch , minister , assistant or guide . " Based on the particulars of the illness and on whether the patient 's constitution is characterized by " insufficiency or excess , heat or cold , " the doctor will adjust the prescription .  
At this time the autumn farming activities went into a phase of decline , and in the north the weather turned cold . There was always some fear that barbarian tribes might " descend south to graze their horses . " At this time everyone began to brush up on their martial skills , even actively going out to kill the barbarians or steal the fat horses and goats that they raised !  
On this day they paid honor to the flag god and inspected the military troops . " Swords and spears bright as snow , banners bright and colorful " accompanied the cold , harsh autumn . It truly carried a sad chill : " The brave warrior goes off , never to return " !  
In northern Taiwan all the old farmers can recite the saying " Before the Awakening of Insects , do n't plant rice seedlings . " This is because the weather around the Awakening of Insects is just beginning to warm up but can still be a little chilly . If the first crop of seedlings is frozen by a late cold spell , then the farmers ' labors will be left unrewarded .  
Just a moment ago your bare arms and legs were a little numb from the cold air . Now they 're numb because the heat is making your blood vessels throb , and your whole body is limp . When you ca n't stand that hot current running through your body any longer , just splash yourself with some cold water .  
Seeing that few survivors remained of this isolated and precious " national treasure " fish , all of which could be wiped out by an unexpected cold spell , it was not enough to simply patrol the river and to educate citizens . The main effort to restore the salmon population became managed breeding .  
In the painting " Spring Thunder , " with the damp cold of its steely grey color scheme , a white flash of lightning steaks out from the left , while amid gusts of rain , plants bend rightward in the direction of the lightning .  
When cooking , the meat is first scalded in hot water and then immediately placed into cold water to cool it down , then slowly simmered over a low heat with a sachet of seasonings . Beef cooked in a clear broth in this way will be chewy and flavorsome , while the broth has a fresh meaty taste and there is no need at all to add MSG .  
The people complained that insurance premiums were too high . In the past an insurance policy allowed for free treatment ; now it has for no apparent reason taken a leap upward in cost due to the " partial cost sharing " regulation . And in the past you could go directly to a hospital to see a doctor with a good reputation for something as simple as a cold ; now with the medical referral system , you ca n't get through the front door .  
As the situation threatened to get out of control , Hsu Hsiao-ming broke out in a cold sweat . Under a blazing sun in Chiayi 's Tungshih , a fishing boat going out to sea was to be filmed for Tropical Fish . Chen Yu-hsun anticipated that the film crew might get seasick , so he gave everyone a motion sickness pill before departure . Maybe someone bought the wrong pills - - true , no one got seasick , but everyone became so drowsy that they spent the entire day sound asleep .  
What Mikes was referring to was the British way of drinking black tea with cold milk and no sugar : " Once this refreshing , aromatic , oriental beverage was successfully transformed into colourless and tasteless gargling-water , it suddenly became the national drink of Great Britain and Reland - - still retaining , indeed usurping , the high-sounding title of tea . "  
Coral reefs require clear , unpolluted water in shallow seas no deeper than 30 meters , so that the symbiotic algae can absorb enough light and the coral can feed on the organisms that float by . If the water 's too hot or too cold the coral will die . Warm waters of 20-30 year round are most suitable . The salinity of the water must be above 0.25% , and so reefs can not be close to the mouth of a river .  
Just as with the tea variety called " pearl tea " by the Chinese ( for the way the leaves are rolled into little round balls ) , but which in Britain was christened " gunpowder , " the old potters of Jingdezhen can never have imagined that when their pure white , smooth , cold porcelain arrived at the other side of the oceans it would have the magical power to stir up such burning desires in young men and women .  
This is the time of year when the weather is affected by cold high-pressure areas from the continent . These create sharp differences in temperature , generating strong upward currents . Also , humidity is low , and there is less concern about rain caused by hot air currents running into cold air at high altitudes .  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
On one occasion , a KMT candidate in the southern part of the island held an outdoor rally , but cold weather kept voters at home . Fortunately the 80-plus strong overseas support group showed up , saving the candidate from a rather embarrassing situation .  
Overall , in terms of cross-strait relations , Chen sees Lee 's inaugural address as being a moderate and not especially innovative speech , but it certainly did express a considerably friendly attitude and reopened the door to discussions . However , people should not expect any sudden breakthrough in cross-strait relations , because Taiwan and the PRC are in a " cold peace " situation , and there is no need to rush things .  
This time the main technical challenge was one of climate : Taiwan 's wet , sub-tropical climate differs vastly from the alternately humid and dry , cold and hot climate of southern Australia . But at least it has continual moisture , which does n't do as much damage as punctuated moisture .  
Several years ago it reached Fuhsing Rural Township to the north . Along the Northern Cross-Island Highway , the air turns cold early in the year , and this brings forward the harvest season of New Century pears , California plums , California honey plums , honey peaches and even kiwi-fruit . Thanks to the abundant sunshine , the quality of the fruit far surpasses that of other areas , and with Taiwan 's largest consumer market , Greater Taipei , close at hand , sales from the area have gradually taken off and overtaken Lishan .  
For the progress of their people , the educational workers of this mountainous area firmly man their posts , happy to lead simple , virtuous lives . Just like the orchid that attracts not the slightest attention , opening up little bright yellow blossoms under the cold wind and clamorous rain , they stand proud , refusing to bow their heads .  
Again , Xue Baocha should have made an ideal wife for the son of a family of high standing , but because she is unable to communicate with Jia Baoyu on a spiritual level , although she gains social rank , she finds no sympathetic resonance , but instead only a cold , empty shell .  
Driving south along the freeway , you leave behind moist northern Taiwan and reach the Huoyan Mountains of Miaoli County . This dry , barren land presents a scene of nothing but landslip-scarred brown earth . But the cold windward upper slopes of the mountains are the lonely stronghold of the " minority people " among Taiwan 's pines-the masson pine ( Pinus massoniana ) .  
The higher the elevation , the later the flowers bloom , and spring flowering species are also followed by summer flowering ones . On the 18th day of the 9th lunar month , in a cold dark forest where all the spring birds had fallen silent , Mei Yao-chen ( 1002-1060 ) of the Northern Song dynasty was delighted to chance upon rhododendron flowers with a color more splendid than the red of a dawn sky .  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
When we come to the Mennonite Christian Hospital in early December , a huge Christmas tree stands in the middle of the foyer of the newly completed hospital building . At the registration counter , in the consulting rooms , at the payment counter , at the pharmacy and even in the staff offices , everywhere is festooned with colored streamers , snowflakes and fairy lights . Instead of the cold , depressing atmosphere usually associated with hospitals , the place is full of the warm and festive spirit of Christmas .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
After cold fronts pass through , however , bird associations are always telling bird watchers to rush off to the seashore and mouths of rivers . If their luck is good , they may be able to see wild geese blown off course by the rough weather .  
As the structure of families and communities changes , the old intimate relations where one would raise the young and care for the old amid the sounds of cocks crowing and dogs barking have been replaced by cold impersonal relations in the urban sea of concrete buildings . As a result , many women have been confined to live lonely lives in their communities .  
At dawn , as the first sliver of the sun 's disc rises out of the sea , its rays strike the specially designed large windows of " Lion 's Kingdom . " Inside , several thousand stone lions have passed the night in lonely silence , but suddenly their round , staring eyes sparkle and come alive . As the exhibition room turns from darkness to light , the contours of their bodies , cold and hard in the blackness , become clear-cut and vital .  
A long table was filled with all kinds of dishes : deep-fried mahua ( dough twists ) , gangzitou ( hard wheatcakes ) , wheat-flour porridge , puffed-rice cakes , lardy rice , roasted sweet potatoes , cold noodles , huibing ( soft wheatcakes cut up and cooked in soup ) , dough drop soup , rice gruel with mung beans . . . .  
In recent years there have been a number of cases of foreign circuses on tour in Taiwan experiencing cash crises which led to animals being abandoned and left cold and hungry . The spring chicken chases held in some localities , in which the fowl are sent scurrying in all directions as people try to grab them , have also attracted accusations of animal abuse .  
After dinner there were further treats to pick up along the way , such as candied jujubes and sauce-stewed chicken and duck , as well as cold drinks such as ginger and honey cordial , sweet bean soup , purple perilla drink , and a sweat-inducing herbal beverage that was popular with the city 's pole-bearers as a form of " sports drink . "  
" He had absolutely no idea that his children all had to swallow their own share of hurt and disappointment while growing up , but never complained to him . Now each of them felt afresh the grievances of childhood , and began to strike back , one after another . " Li described the ensuing scenario : " Some wheeled out their heavy artillery and some used the machine-gun approach . Cannon and gunfire rang out on that cold rainy night , while tears flowed and fireworks exploded .  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
Anaphalis nepalensis ( 11 ) ( family Asteraceae ) is a typical Taiwanese alpine plant . It has a short stem , and the whole plant is covered in fluffy hairs and papery round flowers which give it excellent protection against the cold .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
When the weather in Taiwan 's low-lands begins to gradually turn cool , in the island 's high mountains the mercury is already plummeting , and all kinds of living things are getting ready for their winter rest . But despite the cold , high up on Mt . Hehuan , Yushan , Mt . Ali and elsewhere one can often see a unique Taiwanese bird species-the collared bush robin-hopping busily along the ground alone in search of food , like a solitary little knight-errant .  
As a result , a region that once had a very dry climate might experience frequent rains , or an area once known for its rains might cease to see any rainfall whatsoever . Under the influence of global warming , all kinds of strange meteorological phenomena might occur , including extreme cold alternating with extreme heat in one locale .  
Through satellite observations , the fishing industry has gradually come to understand the waxing and waning of cold and warm currents . Noting the succession of warm winters in the 1990s , and a 1 �X C rise in sea temperatures around Taiwan , the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute also began making fish catch forecasts based on sea temperatures . For instance , the temperature that best suits mullet is 21-23 �X C , but last year the institute predicted that sea temperatures around southern Taiwan would be 2-3 �X C warmer this winter than in previous years .  
He has written that he once went with a German friend to a recreational spot , and saw how this friend was absolutely delighted to see that the railings had been made out of rough , deep-green bamboo , only to find upon touching them that the sensation was of cold and clammy concrete .  
All types of fish that can be eaten raw have a fairly high fat content , but the bluefin is particularly famed for its fattiness . The Pacific bluefin that migrate through the waters east of Taiwan prefer lower water temperatures than other tuna , and usually stay north of the 18th parallel . To protect it from cold the Pacific bluefin has more fat than the yellowfin and albacore , which are distributed around the equator , or the southern bluefin , which lives in the southern hemisphere .  
Although they had not " done " anything , she broke out in a cold sweat . Her concern reminded me of the time a few years ago when I discovered a 15-year-old student whom I was tutoring engaged in a raucous game of mahjongg with three classmates , each of them accompanied by a girlfriend !  
An October weekend in Suzhou 's Mudu Town , there 's not a cloud in the sky but the cold wind chills to the bone . In order to control costs , the film crew for producer Young Pei-pei 's adapted script based on Gu Long 's famous martial arts novel Flying Sword Meets Flying Sword has divided into two groups who work in shifts from early morning to late at night .  
We witnessed how homeless people at Lungshan Temple died of cold when cold fronts swept through at Western New Year 's . The next day , the news was flooded with stories of celebrities and the details of their elegant New Year apparel ; even as frigid corpses lay in the street , the consumerist priorities of the global economy held sway , and only the goings-on of the rich were on people 's lips .  
In winter , the northeast monsoon makes for cold and wet weather with frequent fog and gusting rains on the northern side of the pass , while the southern side stays clear and dry . The very distinct climates make for radically different kinds of vegetation on the two sides of the pass .  
He once broke out with dermatitis while working on the eve of Chinese New Year . His entire body turned red and swelled , itching set in , and he had to soak all evening in a tub despite the cold winter weather . While everyone else was enjoying the most festive night of the year , Lai suffered through the bleakest New Year 's Eve of his life .  
Regrettably , even as the country was getting tough on domestic quarantine , in mid-May a doctor from Mackay Memorial Hospital caused an international incident when he showed SARS symptoms while in Japan . Assuming that he only had the flu , he took some cold medicine and finished his travel itinerary , only later discovering that one of the patients he treated in hospital later died as a probable SARS victim .  
The earliest tea in Taiwan was wild tea growing in the mountains around Puli , Nantou County . A small number of Aborigines also cultivated tea for medicinal purposes , but because under theories of Chinese medicine it was considered " cold , " it was not deemed suitable as a casual drink . Large-scale cultivation of tea began only with the arrival in Taiwan of immigrants from Anxi ( Fujian ) during the Qing Dynasty .  
In any case , the domestic tourist economy is rapidly gaining ground after its precipitous fall and entrepreneurs feel like they have jumped from the cold pool at a hot springs straight into the hot pool , going from one extreme to the other . Aside from SARS receding into the background and the approach of the summer holiday season , a new-found unity among tourism entrepreneurs has been a key element in the rapid resurgence of the industry .  
Apart from raising tinsmithing to the realm of art , he has been constantly tinkering , improving the properties of tin to make it stronger and harder , to allow it to keep its luster longer , and to give it a silky feel . He has also employed traditional casting , cold forging and detailed carving to expand its expressive abilities .  
The ancestors of this pint-sized member of the family Sylviidae ( the old-world warblers ) came from cold northern lands . Biogeographical evidence shows that they first spread out northeastward from the Himalayas into northern and northeastern China and Japan , and later moved south during the ice ages , reaching Taiwan via southern China or Japan .  
Whenever Huang Shu-hui thinks of the many cold winter evenings her mother spent in the homes of other people , huddled in front of the fire , she is moved to tears . This motivated her to be successful whatever the cost , so that her mother would never again have to live such a hard life .  
No matter whether modern or postmodern , classical or neoclassical , or an eclectic mix of old and new , restaurants in the " petty bourgeois " or " middle class " style are friendly , welcoming places , neither pretentiously modern in a cold and snooty way , nor self-consciously old school and superior . Taiwanese have long been good at creating this kind of atmosphere .  
In my youthful enthusiasm for that novel adventure I blithely forgot that I had always only barely made the grade in terms of physical fitness , and busily set about buying my first rucksack , my first pair of hiking boots , and a full set of warm outdoor clothes . In the biting cold of the seventh day of the lunar New Year , I excitedly set off on my first aeroplane flight , to Taichung where the group was to assemble .  
Yushan National Park is crowded with peaks , and crisscrossed by river valleys , making the terrain highly varied . Additionally , vegetation zones with hot , warm , cool , and cold climates can be found at different altitudes . As a result , except for the tropical plants along the coast , virtually all the types of vegetation found in Taiwan can be observed . It is little wonder that Yushan is such a haven for botanical researchers .  
One year , Kung planted his plots with a kind of mini-gourd , and the entire crop was hit by a mutation , causing the gourds to be more pear-shaped instead of their usual hourglass-like shape . He took this mutant variety in to a seed company , who discovered after some trials that that variety of mini-gourd was particularly susceptible to mutation in cold temperatures-Kung had planted them during winter . The seed company planted another row during summer , which produced gourds of the normal shape .  
Lu Ming-fong says , " If we combine genetic research with traditional Chinese medicine we will make the road ahead much shorter . " Traditional Chinese medicine divides the human organism into the five different phases , or constitutions , of metal , wood , water , fire , and earth . Genes also show that different people have different constitutions . For example , it appears that people with cardiovascular diseases rarely get cancer , because heart disease is what Chinese medicine calls a " hot " condition , whereas cancer is a " cold " one .  
He does n't rest easy until his ink has finished drying . In Taiwan , the best time of year for making ink runs from the eighth month of the lunar calendar through the second month of the following year , when the weather is relatively cool and there is little rain . The best ink is made in the winter because the ink blocks shrink in the cold , dry quickly , and keep their shape .  
A few extra charcoal blocks are thrown on the fire to boil water and provide heat . Although the temperature in Taiwan 's plains can go as high as 30oC in late May , when night comes , it falls to 4-5oC on the north peak and there is often a strong cold wind . Sweaters , hats and thick socks are basic requirements all year round . " Not until November 1997 did a helicopter bring the first load of charcoal to the Yushan Weather Station , " says Hsieh .  
Helanshan Mountain , extending more than 250 kilometers to the north and south , is situated in the border area of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia , two large autonomous regions .  It is an important natural and geographical border , a water resource conservation forest and a natural ecological defense for the attacks of Tenggeli desert and Siberia cold wave .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .  
The Helan Mountain Range , about 250 kilometers long , extends from south to north along the common border of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia . It is an important natural geographical demarcation line in northwestern China as well as a water conservatory forest area .  The mountain range is also a natural protective shield , which stops the Tenger desert from expanding to the east and the inroad of Siberian cold current .  
Mt . Helan , stretching more than 250 km from south to north , is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia , the two large autonomous regions .  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China , it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current .  
li also briefed the russian guests on china 's foreign policies he said that after the cold war , the world is facing a multi polarization trend yet the world is not peaceful new conflicts and contradictions keep occurring the gap between the north and the south is further enlarged , li said  
He explained that the meeting of transient cold weather and warm and damp air mass , which is comparatively active this winter , has brought about the two snowfalls , which are bound to bring down the temperature in the Beijing area  
Notwithstanding the positive initiative taken by the major nuclear Powers since the end of the cold war , there is still a need to establish a close link between disarmament and international peace in the years ahead .  
The end of the cold war , the emerging enhanced role of the United Nations and the prevailing political climate of conciliation create an ideal environment for an effective effort to achieve permanent solutions to long-standing problems .  
Thus , despite the deep-rooted and persistent social and institutional factors that have long affected the country , there is reason to hope that in the not-too-distant future this situation which to a certain extent is a remnant of the cold war will be rectified , leading to the achievement of the permanent peace which remains the most fervent hope of the people of Guatemala .  
In addition , temporary expedients such as putting " cold " surgery on waiting lists , making real reductions in services in some fields , such as paying for surgery and not internal medicine , and reducing the level of reimbursement of patients ' hospital bills and " capping " the total amounts have all been applied .  
Nevertheless , the systematic abuse of human rights which tactical allies were allowed to engage in , and which also characterized the Soviet Union and its areas of influence , reduced the ethical quality of the world inherited after the ending of the cold war .  
But what would it have been like had the United Nations not existed to channel activities for peace , to oversee the post-war period and the cold war , to give its moral sanction to the emancipation of peoples , to coordinate assistance for economic and social development and to set a moral standard and order relations among nations and human beings ?  
Despite the end of the cold war , which has lessened the probability of nuclear conflict , the Earth continues to be an arena of murderous conflicts that cause unspeakable suffering and vast humanitarian tragedies .  
The end of the East-West bipolarity that plagued the world during the cold war and the disappearance of the ideological demarcation line that divided the world into two camps should prompt us to seize this historic opportunity afforded us by the current transitional period to lay down new foundations for North-South cooperation and to narrow the economic gap between them .  
Moreover , while the threat of a major international confrontation has receded with the end of the cold war , a host of other problems , including an upsurge in inter-State conflicts , international terrorism , growing poverty and marginalization of vast segments of humanity in the developing countries as well as within affluent societies , are coming to the fore .  
This fiftieth anniversary is indeed cause for celebration : United Nations membership has grown from 51 States to 185 ; the old colonial empires , as we all know , have been dismantled , even if new forms are emerging ; the cold war may seem to be at an end , though many of us are still living with its very painful legacies ; and issues of the environment , women and children , social development and population have been placed at the centre of the development agenda .  
The cold war is over , the geopolitical map has been radically altered , a worldwide democratization process has emerged , cooperation has replaced confrontation and a globalization process has begun in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres .  
In fact , although the changes that took place in the wake of the cold war led to a certain easing in international relations and promoted , as never before , democratic values , the international situation nevertheless has continued to deteriorate in recent times in the political , economic , social and financial spheres .  
Today we can say that in the 1990s , with the end of the cold war and the breakdown of totalitarianism , an unprecedented opportunity presented itself to change the course of history and , for the first time , to secure the values of a democratic , just , peaceful , civil and reconciled society , with Governments brought to power by the freely expressed will of the people .  
Owada ( Japan ) : The fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations , coming as it did in the midst of the structural changes that are taking place in the world in the wake of the end of the cold war , has offered us a golden opportunity for sober reflection upon the role of the United Nations in the contemporary international system .  
The increase in the number of Member States to 185 ; the end of the cold war and the concomitant , regrettable radicalization of nationalism and group identity , which cause internal and inter-State conflicts ; and the perverse effects of the economic and financial crisis on the democratization of institutions and on human rights all these events and challenges highlight the urgent need to carry out a reform of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular . 
The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that the United Nations , freed from nuclear and ideological confrontation , would devote its full attention to building a peaceful and more equitable world ; tackle the challenge of world poverty ; advance regional conflicts to resolution ; distribute the benefits of peace dividends ; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized premises of the Charter , especially with regard to collective security . 
" Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .  
Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
The Government of Cuba stressed that despite the end of the cold war , certain Powers , based on their predominant position in the world economy , have continued to use coercive economic measures against developing countries .  
It was further suggested that the end of the cold war , the growing integration of the world economy and the emerging consensus on development policies seemed to have created a propitious confluence of forces in favour of a constructive and non-confrontational dialogue designed to meet the global challenges of poverty and development in a rapidly changing international environment .  
NULLWe note with satisfaction that today , now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the " cold war " has ended , new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element . 
These obstacles must be analysed in the context of international political and economic relations characterized by the globalization of the economy and in a specific historical context marked by the end of the cold war and East-West confrontation , the emergence of regional economic groupings and the concentration of economic , financial and technological power in the hands of a limited number of countries .  
was important to recognize that security was no longer defined as it had been in the cold war era : security was currently threatened by socio-economic problems - massive migrations , global epidemics and environmental degradation - which could only be resolved in the interest of all countries by multilateral action .

Despite the end of the cold war , regional , religious and ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in various parts of our planet , and consequently world peace and security are gravely disturbed and peoples are suffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them .  
Turkey and the pseudo-state , taking advantage of a peaceful demonstration by Greek Cypriots , proceeded a few weeks ago , with the active involvement of the extremist terrorist Turkish group the Grey Wolves , to implement a meticulously prepared plan which was crowned by the murder in cold blood of two young Cypriots and the injuries sustained by many others , United Nations peacekeepers included .  
The relevant provisions of the Summit 's final document , agreed at the highest level , could play a most important role in the positive development of negotiations both within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other current mediatory efforts of the OSCE . For several years since the end of the cold war active discussions have been taking place in the world on the transformation of international relations .  
But how many millions of these cold , cruel and silent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent civilian population in remote areas of the country near the western border ? 
The Social Summit expressed the political will to take advantage of a window of opportunity that has opened in the world with the end of the cold war to let in fresh air and to overcome the age-old ideological intolerance and rivalries of power politics , which were impediments to true international solidarity and served only selfish self-interest .  
That positive development the end of the cold war also encouraged many in the developing world , especially those of us in Africa , to undertake far-reaching political and economic reform measures , with a view to laying the foundation for democratic transformation and meaningful economic growth and development .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
While others were progressing , we were stagnating , locked in a cruel domestic struggle that included elements imported from the cold war , which arbitrarily kept in check for 40 years our political , social and economic evolution .  
But how many millions of these cold , cruel and silent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent civilian population in remote areas of the country near the western border ? 
The United States is becoming more undisguised in its moves to build up a " tripartite military alliance " with Japan and south Korea , and moves forward on a full scale with the reintroduction of its cold war era policy to the Korean peninsula and its vicinity , by repeatedly launching joint military exercises among the United States , south Korea and Japan over the so-called " north Korea 's threat " .  
Although the political environment since the end of the cold war had favoured international cooperation in the utilization of outer space , the level of cooperation remained unsatisfactory ; there was a reluctance to share space benefits because of the huge outlay involved .  
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
There were also those who considered that , in view of the time that has elapsed since the adoption of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the profound and far-reaching changes that have transformed the international security landscape since the end of the cold war era , and the advent of a new century , profitable use could be made of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to review and assess progress towards the " grand vision " and programme of action of the Final Document .  
As to the nature and causes of small arms ' destabilizing accumulation and transfer , in his January 1994 Supplement to an Agenda for Peace , the Secretary-General identified four basic reasons : earlier supply during the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets and criminal activity combined with the collapse of governmental law and order .  
The veto power , flawed in principle as it was and remains , may have had a useful purpose during the cold war era , but with the improved international environment and , indeed , the increase of diplomatic avenues to resolve differences , the continued existence of the veto is as undemocratic as it is irrelevant .  
Although significant progress had been made in the field of human rights , particularly in the eradication of apartheid and the adoption of conventions protecting the human rights of women and children , the enjoyment of political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights was far from being universal , and it was regrettable that the end of the cold war had not brought about an improvement in the situation .  
AYEWAH ( Nigeria ) said that the rapid expansion of United Nations peacekeeping operations since the end of the cold war reflected the belief in such operations as an effective instrument for stabilizing , containing and helping to resolve conflicts which undermined confidence among States and endangered international peace and security .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
Some people have thought that the end of the so-called cold war would be conducive to the creation of favourable conditions for equitable and healthy international relations based on mutual respect and fruitful and constructive cooperation among human communities .  
When an exceptionally cold winter in the northern hemisphere raised demand , inventories were allowed to fall as the industry expected that Iraq would resume exporting oil under Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , in which the Council authorized States to permit the import of petroleum and petroleum products originating in Iraq , sufficient to produce a sum not exceeding a total of US $ 1-billion every 90 days .  
At police stations , the forms of torture and ill-treatment reported include kicking ; beating ; application of electric shocks by means of batons or small electrical generators ; the use of self-tightening handcuffs ; deprivation of food ; exposure to alternating extremes of hot and cold temperatures ; enforced standing in difficult positions ; enforced standing in cold water ; prolonged shackling of detainees spread-eagled to a wall ; placing of heated objects on the skin ; and striking with iron rods on the joints or hands .  
Nevertheless , these decisive changes did not come about easily and had to make their way within an extremely hostile international setting marked by the cold war , and at a time when the so _ called national security doctrine was becoming established in many developing countries and across virtually the whole of the American continent .  
This is both a theoretical and political challenge as these rights were formulated in a context that was totally different economically and above all politically : the post-war period , the cold war , the existence of a socialist bloc and of competitive capitalism based on strong nation states .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
Our expectations , in the wake of the cold war , for the establishment of international peace and security and social and economic prosperity for humanity have not yet been fulfilled , because of continued civil and regional wars .  
Though the end of the cold war has greatly reduced the threat of another global war , which twice in this century brought untold sorrow to mankind , intra-country conflicts and civil wars continue to wreak havoc in several countries , with resultant loss of lives , destruction of national infrastructure , displacement of innocent persons and outflow of refugees into neighbouring countries .  
All of this madness has revived official and covert operations , mercenaries , spies and assassins , as ready now as in the worst days of the cold war to plot and unleash terror against human beings and even employ aggressive biological agents against our economy .  
In the twentieth century brutal local and global conflicts , the development and use of the cruellest weapons , the attempted extermination of entire peoples and a seemingly endless cold war gave credibility to the nightmare visions of that earlier generation .  
In spite of the major political changes around the world , characterized , inter alia , by the end of the cold war and the promising prospects for the settlement of several regional conflicts , and in spite of formidable advances in science and technology , the fact remains that the hopes raised by this dynamic have not had the positive results we had hoped for in the social sphere .  
The cold war had just ended , and barriers both real and perceived were falling , paving the way for precisely this type of treaty negotiated on a multilateral basis , as opposed to the bipolar accords with which the world was more familiar .  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
Generally speaking , the capitalist revolution ( free-market reforms and well-conceived and prudently implemented privatization in the post cold war period ) has increased foreign investment , streamlined the public sector and reduced inflation , bringing about a significant level of stability and prosperity .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
The cold war , represented by the zero-sum game mentality , where some gain at the expense of others , is giving way to more positive trends and constructive attitudes , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world based on advancing the interests of all .  
Against the backdrop of the end of the cold war and the diminished possibility of global nuclear confrontation , the Board discussed the security consequences of economic globalization , the lessening of the importance of national boundaries and the increase in intra-State conflict and illicit trafficking in small arms and other criminal activities .  
It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
To them the end of the cold war simply dictated changes in the positioning of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and the taking of steps to develop new nuclear-weapon systems to meet the geopolitical requirements of the new international system .  
For instance , technology for space _ based extra _ atmospheric lightweight kinetic projectiles developed in the cold war is being used to develop a Navy Area Defense System capable of intercepting targets in outer space at an altitude of 500 km .  
Thirdly , the adoption of a renewed Strategic Concept by a regional military alliance _ despite the declared end of the cold war _ is bound to generate considerable concern in the wide spectrum of nuclear and non _ nuclear States .  
Following the end of cold war , the United Nations has been called upon to take up new challenges and tasks as a result of the growing threat from the existence of large stockpiles of nuclear weapons , proposals for ballistic missile defences and the weaponization of outer space , the lack of progress in the field of disarmament , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the development and use of advanced and sophisticated conventional arms ;  
However , as the years passed , the post-war solidarity gave way to the cold war and instead of one unified covenant , those rights were codified in 1966 in two international covenants - one on civil and political rights , another on economic , social and cultural rights .  
The present ruler of south Korea asserted openly on several occasions that " sunshine " capable of melting away the other party , not " strong wind " , meaning head-on confrontation , would be more effective for " undressing " the north , saying that it was not the cold war , but the " appeasement policy " of the United States that caused the collapse of the former Soviet Union and that it is the " engagement policy " that induced a certain country to " reform " and " opening " . 
In the post _ cold _ war world which emerged at the beginning of the present decade , the initial phase of optimism , cooperation and the adoption of major decisions in the field of world strategic policy has gradually been replaced by another in which narrow individual and often intransigent considerations on the part of the various international actors tend to prevail .  
So it is that the objective of collective security of States , associated with the new horizons opened up at the end of the cold war and serious progress towards general and complete disarmament which should involve first and foremost weapons of mass destruction will be expressed in the new terms of physical well-being and quality of life for citizens .  
The State Cold Storage Company is an economic organization consisting of a network of units specialized in the management and operation of cold storage facilities and a fleet of refrigerated trucks for foodstuffs ( chicken , meat , eggs , cheese , potatoes , apples , citrus fruit , cream , butter , fish , mortadella and other imported and local animal products ) . 
Women shall not be employed in types of work which are hazardous , which require considerable physical exertion or which are harmful to health , such as the carrying of heavy loads , work performed underground or under water and work which exposes them to toxic substances or to cold or heat exceeding the limits which can reasonably be borne by women .  
Over the last 50 years , and especially since the end of the cold war , the decrease in the number of international armed conflicts has been offset by an increase in the number of civil wars and other situations of internal violence , which are characterized by massive and systematic violations of human rights .  
We are troubled to see that in a world dominated by a single military and technological Power , we are today less safe than during the difficult years of the cold war .  
Although originally designed to foster unity and promote the quest for an understanding among the great Powers , the veto turned out to be an oft-misused tool , both in the ideological battle among bitter rivals during the cold war and in the pursuit of narrow national interests .  
The economic and political developments in international relations ; the far-reaching changes that have taken place , particularly in the wake of the end of the cold war ; and the accession of many new States to the membership of the United Nations all have made it imperative that the Security Council be reformed , its membership increased and its methods of work and activities made more effective in the discharge of the mandate entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations .  
The delegation of India highlighted in the First Committee last year the fact that , with the end of the cold war more than a decade ago , there is no justification for thousands of nuclear weapons being maintained in a state of hair-trigger alert , creating unacceptable risks of unintentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons .  
In Europe the only military bloc left over from the cold war , under its new strategic concept , bypassed the United Nations Security Council and bombed , with the worlds most powerful and sophisticated military machinery , a weak sovereign State , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , turning the Balkan region , which has experienced so much misery in this century , into a testing ground for its new strategy .  
On the other hand , blindfolding , the use of hosing with cold water , straight hanging ( suspension by the raised arms from a crossbar ) , rough physical treatment , sexual abuses and threats of rape , the use of grossly insulting language and the making of threats to the life and physical integrity of detainees or their families still seem rife in many parts of the country .  
I have the honour to inform you that a few days ago the Republic of Honduras ratified a maritime delimitation treaty concluded between Honduras and Colombia on 2 August 1986 , when Nicaragua was suffering the ravages of a bloody civil war caused by ideological differences resulting from the cold war .  
When , after the end of the cold war , the world seemed to be developing towards a promising situation because of the gradual reduction of interState conflicts , the African continent suddenly fell victim to armed confrontations of unprecedented violence .  
It is inspired by a vision of the enormous potential for human development created by the end of the cold war , the accelerated pace of technological development and the deepening interdependence of nations .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States had dismantled more than 13,000 warheads , a process which included the physical separation of the warheads conventional high explosive from its fissile material .  
The living conditions in this camp are harsh , especially for widows , elderly women and the many children , who often live in an intolerably precarious state , suffering from illnesses , malnutrition and the cold .  
Residual effects of regional conflicts and of the tension that marked the cold war have led to an unprecedented increase in the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons , whose intended recipients are mainly developing countries .  
It is thus absolutely incomprehensible to us that , in this day and age , the mind of a human being could entertain the senseless idea of destroying , in cold blood and for reasons having nothing to do with public utility , archaeological monuments whose value to humanity resides not only in their artistic merits and historical interest , but also in the venerability they derive from their association with one of the most ancient religions in the world .  
If international and regional conflicts were once a result of the cold-war climate that then prevailed , the past decade , which saw the end of the cold war , was marked by regional and civil strife that was more brutal , more tragic and more devastating than the conflicts of the cold-war era .  
It was assumed that the end of colonialism , the cold war and apartheid would relieve the sufferings of many African peoples ; instead , the situation has deteriorated further , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and criminal gangs who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
Notwithstanding the fresh hopes for a safer environment brought about by the end of the cold war , the world has experienced a proliferation of regional conflicts and armed hostilities , and has witnessed a trend towards the spread and destabilizing accumulation of sophisticated weapons systems , including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
After the so-called end of the cold war , those who continued a military build-up and the development of the most sophisticated means of killing and exterminating human beings were aware that their huge military investments would give them the privilege of imposing their absolute and complete dominance over the other peoples of the world .  
He Xiaohong , a senior engineer with the autonomous region 's meteorological bureau , said such weather phenomenon was formed due to a recent significant cold air current coming southward down from the north of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau . When it merged with the warm northward up current from the Indian Ocean between the Mount Nyainqentanglha and the Himalayas , rain or sleet was formed .  
After the end of the cold war , ASEAN confronted new international and regional situations and comprehensively adjusted its development strategy and foreign relations strategy , and increasingly became a cooperative organization in the southeast Asia region based on economic cooperation and integrating politics , economy and security .  
On the firing practice field , a group of soldiers in camouflage uniform quietly lied prostrate in the cold wind .  The three greenish black " Hongjian " antitank missiles settled on the missile-support strut stood straight up , alert and ready , and the warheads glared like a tiger at the white target several thousand meters away .  
As far as military strategy was concerned , the United States had adopted a new set of operational methods for high-technology limited warfare following the end of the cold war , but NATO 's operational methods and command systems had not departed completely from the operational approach designed for the prospect of fighting big battles with the Soviet Union . Therefore , there was a lack of coordination between them in the operations .  
In the agreement reached on the summit meeting , both sides reaffirmed the three major principles of independence , peaceful reunification , and great national unity , which are not only conducive to both sides improving relations through dialogue , to realizing reconciliation , and to ultimately realizing peaceful reunification , but also in accord with the current requirements of the times for peace and development and are conducive to dispelling the cloud of a cold war over the peninsula and to maintaining peace in northeast Asia .  
After the cold war ended , the U.S . military 's traditional opponent has gone out of existence .  Driven by its strategic need to assert sole hegemony over the globe with its " new cold-war thinking " and its narrow interest in expanding the increasingly shrinking survival space for military forces , the U.S . military has always been concocting a virtual opponent .  
It has made one innovation after another and has developed " tools for cooking and distributing hot foods " , " water filters for camp and field training " , " mobile barracks on vehicles " , and " oil heaters for cold areas on plateaus " .  It has laid a solid foundation for solving difficult problems that restrain long distance mobile support for the armed forces .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
In the 1990 ' s , after the end of the cold war , under international disarmament pressure and opposition from peace forces in Japan , Japan instituted the guideline of " reducing armaments on the one hand while improving the quality on the other " in its military building , and worked to build modern armed forces of " the right scale and ample quality . "  
Since the cold war , Japan has been more active in pursuing its diplomatic line in seeking to become a world political power ; in military affairs , therefore , it has gradually changed its relatively passive and inward-looking military strategy and army building guidelines of the cold war period , in order to shake off Japan 's international image as a country with imbalance of economic , political , and military status , in a bid to play a greater role in a multipolar world .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States has indeed enjoyed nearly 10 years of sustained economic growth , but in respect of citizens ' rights of existence , the gap between rich and poor in American society is growing and the population living in poverty is increasing .  
Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .  
They even slept near the door to fence off cold winds for their comrades .  In peaceful times , Party members took the lead in answering the call of the Party , executing Party lines and completing urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks .  
make proper arrangements for the basic livelihood of the people of disaster areas ; and make sure that earthquake victims will not suffer from hunger and cold and will receive medical treatment when falling ill , and epidemic diseases are prevented from occurring .  Efforts should be made to mobilize and organize cadres and the masses of the people to display the spirit of self-reliance and hard work , enthusiastically carry out self-help production projects , pull together tide over difficulties , resume production as quickly as possible , and prevent spring production from being neglected .  
The DPRK Nodong Sinmun published a commentary condemning the US-ROK joint military exercise as a " strategic provocation . "  It pointed out that the United States is attempting to continue to carry out its hostile policy of strangling the DPRK " by power , " and the US adventurist actions have poured cold water on the people of the Korean peninsula who earnestly desire national self-determination and reunification and a beautiful future .  
As the strategic turning point in China strategy , 1989 , the year when the Soviet Union broke up and the cold war ended [ as received ] , completely changed the status of US global strategy : Its powerful opponent collapsed overnight , and the United States , which was in the most favorable situation , very quickly started to change its China policy from " soft " to " pushing for change . "  
Seeing that the US MD plan was getting the cold shoulder throughout international society , with even NATO unable to reach unanimous agreement on supporting US implementation of the plan , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi hastened to make some major changes in his previous attitude , that the US missile plan was " very meaningful research . "  
In that period , China just witnessed the feudal dynasty 's surrendering of the nation 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the imperialist foreign powers ' despotic and domineering practice on its land , unceasing social turbulences , and the people 's miserable lives of suffering from hunger and cold . 
In the first 80-year period , the feudal rulers surrendered the country 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the whole society was thrown into utter chaos caused by wars , the country became impoverished and weak and the people lived in hunger and cold .  
Clinton handed over to Bush the quite good relationship with China which prevailed during the latter part of his presidency , but when Bush took office the majority of those he employed were Republican conservatives and cold warriors , and moreover they had been absent from the political arena for many years and their understanding of current world issues was markedly backward .  As a result US relations with many countries have become deadlocked in less than half a year after Bush took office .  
Still more important , following the reliable legal guarantee for all-round development of bilateral relations provided by the " Sino-Russian Treaty of Good neighborly Friendship and Cooperation , " a new page will be turned in this relationship in the new century , and in the face of the new-style state relations of mutual trust and benefit established by China and Russia , the disintegration strategy pushed by the sole superpower in combination with its cold war mentality unilateralism will be of no avail .  
The " Sino-Russian Treaty of Good neighborly friendship and Cooperation " sets down in legal form the aspirations and resolve of China and Russia to be forever good neighbors , good partners , and good friends , and totally discards the cold war mentality of being either in alliance or confrontation ; it is an expression of the new-style interstate relations of seeking security through trust and cooperation through mutual benefit , and is a programmatic document guiding the healthy and steady development of Sino-Russian relations in the new century .  
After the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia in 1991 , President Jiang Zemin and Russia 's first President Yeltsin profoundly summed up the experiences and lessons of history ; based on the strategic requirements of their countries ' national construction and development , and in accordance with the new characteristics and trends of changes in the international situation , they decided to establish a new style of interstate relationship completely different from the cold war period .  
Second , this treaty discards the old mentality and pattern of the cold war period by which interstate relations were either in alliance or confrontational , and has laid down for Sino-Russian relations the properties of being nonaligned , non-confrontational , and not being aimed at any third country , thus setting a good example for the international community in pursuing security through trust and cooperation through mutual benefit .  
After the trials of training in high temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius and frigid cold of 30 degrees Celsius below zero ; after successively moving across Bohai , Donghai , Nanhai , and other sea areas ; after undergoing rigid training and roughing it out , the Navy Marines of our army have now found an operational program that is suitable for moving , eating , living , and fighting in all kinds of weathers and environments under the condition of modern warfare .  They have also mastered the skill of fighting in complicated regions .  
This treaty makes long-term plans for Sino-Russian relations in the 21st century , and in particular lays down that the two parties will enduringly and comprehensively develop a strategic cooperation partnership of good neighborliness , friendship , cooperation , and trust as equals .  This treaty expresses in concentrated form the broad common interests of the two countries in bilateral relations and international affairs .  The treaty does away with the cold war mentality that interstate relations are either alliance or confrontation ;

In the first 80-year period , the feudal lords surrendered the country 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the whole society was thrown into utter chaos caused by wars , the country became impoverished and weak and the people lived in hunger and cold .  
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .

As a result of Kim T'ae-chung 's visit to North Korea as President , the North and South have formally acknowledged the objective existence of their respective independent political entities ; in addition , mentally redefining each other 's status is beneficial not only for easing antagonism and tension in their relationship but also for establishing a relationship of peaceful coexistence and replacing their cold war relations of more than 50 years with a new relationship of coexistence and common prosperity ;  
In the Drought Agriculture Ecology Laboratory , which is a key state project , a young professor gave Jiang Zemin an account of one of their scientific research achievements : In view of the unique drought and cold geographical conditions of the west region , Professor Zhao Songlin , the first director of the laboratory , proposed a brand new idea of developing " catchment type ecological agriculture , " which was successful in practice .  
What formed a sharp contrast to the election , which proceeded in an unprecedentedly intense way , was that diplomatic issues , particularly the China issue which became a hot issue in previous general elections , were unprecedentedly left out in the cold .  
After the cold war ended , South Korea 's comprehensive national strength has increased rapidly and popular indignation has been roused by the U.S . troops ' constant misdeeds and commitments of crimes against law .  There have been loud cries in South Korea for revision of this unequal agreement .  
A cold front developed to the north of Hong Kong and moved south on May 24 bringing heavy showers and squally thunderstorms to local areas .  
A cold front crossed the south China coastal areas on the morning of November 1 .  It brought a few rain patches to the New Territories . Winds strengthened from the north and the weather was mainly cloudy .  
He pointed out that since the 1980s , the HKO had been using solar energy to power remote automatic weather stations which helped to give early warnings on impending weather such as tropical cyclones , heavy rain , high wind and cold fronts .  
The two men under arrest , aged 33 and 47 , were subsequently charged with operating an unlicensed cold store , failing to keep the cold store clean and possession of prohibited food ( pork not from approved source ) for sale .  
A weak cold front arrived at the south China coastal areas on October 4 .  The weather in Hong Kong turned hazy at first and became cloudy with thundery showers in the afternoon .  Around 80 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over parts of the Lantau Island .  
The adults in general did not perceive the need for regular dental check-ups .  Most of them had experienced various oral health problems such as bad breath , bleeding gums , sensitivity to hot and cold , and pain that disturbed sleeping .  
In addition , prospective donors who have contracted common cold or have symptoms as upper respiratory tract infection , such as fever , running nose , sore threat and cough are reminded to postpone their blood donation until and after a full recovery .  
His lips were purple from the cold , his face bloodless , but his eyes shone with a fanatical ecstasy . At last the owner recognized the wild man before him as the person who ten days before had cared so much about the red glazed bottle .  
Some could tolerate the cold , but were not too tasty ; others were large and flavorful , but required a long maturation period . Scientists bred to achieve a hardy , plump , tasty , quick growing fish .  
If prepared well , the meat is juicy , tender , and delectable . Preparing crabs is not difficult . First clean two fresh crabs in cold water .  
Every winter it is first to face the seasonal winds which sweep in from the north . The accompanying cold and drizzle last until spring . With clothing that takes days to dry , bedding prone to mildew , shoes easily ruined and houses continually damp , Keelung 's residents are constantly reminded of the steady rainfall during these months .  
The geographic position of the island off the east coast of the Asian landmass places it in one of the main migratory flyways for countless bird species making their annual winter trips south from the cold lands of north Asia .  
A silver candle 's autumnal glow is cold on the painted screen . A small fan of light gauze flaps at the drifting fireflies . On the Heavenly Stairs the dim night is as cool as water . She lies and watches the stars of the Herdboy and the Weaving Girl .  
In the first , murderers and brigands are tied to a bronze pole filled with fire . The second contains Blade Mountain . Here those who blasphemed the Buddha or wantonly killed living creatures are forced to climb naked up a mountain of innumerable sharp swords . Punished in the last level , the hell of freezing cold , are husband-killers , adulterers , the unfilial , and those who urged others to gamble .  
The snake population is high in gem mining zones , partly because the residents try to co-exist with them , but mainly because snakes like to live where jade deposits are plentiful . An experienced miner explained that snakes prefer jade-laden stone habitats because the temperature remains cool in summer yet has residual warmth during cold spells .  
Generally speaking , the more exotic varieties an orchid raiser keeps , the more astonishing the amount of equipment required : since the orchids ca n't be too cold , too hot , too moist , too dry , too shady , or too sunlit , a full panoply of air conditioners , sunlamps , thermostats , mist sprayers , and whatnot is called for .  
In the social sciences , economics and public finance are the most promising departments , while the continued rise of the population 's median age will mean an increased demand for social workers to provide services for the elderly . However , limitations on the number of candidates who can pass the bar examinations make law a rather " cold " field .  
In the old section you 'll see students from Heidelberg University wearing thick coats and carrying bundles of books . They brave the cold December winds as they walk through the market district , which sells Italian leather , French perfumes , and mink coats . Then they take a sharp turn into a small red brick alley to a seventeenth century Gothic style building . Just behind the huge wooden doors the professor is getting ready for class .

Family doctor Tony Shieh says that the most direct way to reduce sexual stimulation is exercise , which lowers seminal vesicle activity , releases energy , and preempts blood from filling up the sex organ . Besides this , a cold shower before bed , light calisthenics , wearing loose-fitting underwear , avoiding a too-warm blanket , and keeping an active lifestyle to tire oneself out are all ways to help overcome excessive sexual desire .  
Springtime in the south of China has but a few days of warm sunlight and gentle breezes ; soon the weather turns cloudy or cold , burying that rare and precious fragrance .  
During the cold winter season it lost all its leaves , and only barren branches are left to wait for the spring . As I watch them , the withered branches seem especially strong and unyielding in the dark . Some of the branches bud early and are soon covered with tender green leaves , transparent , smooth and clean . The veins on each heart-shaped leaf are clear to the scrutiny of night .  
Among the cold plates . sung-hua t'ang-hsin p'i-tan [ sugar-coated preserved eggs ] has a soft and slippery texture that can be matched with crispy smoked fish , with tough and chewy beef tendon or pig 's knuckle , and with liquor-saturated chicken , shrimp , or the like , which are chewy but not too tough .  
But the people of Shantung are clever . They fry the bananas in cane syrup and chill them in cold water to make the syrup crisp . The person eating one gets a nice crisp feeling before biting into the soft inside , and the combination of textures makes for a peculiar but exquisite treat .  
As part of this way of thinking , Chinese people strive to maintain a balance within the individual between the forces of yin and yang ( the dual principles of male and female , or positive and negative ) , which have influenced the concepts of hot and cold in Chinese food and medicine .  
The theory of the " malignant / benign polarity " might sound reasonable enough , and the various traditional Chinese occult sciences based on it , such as geomancy ( examining this polarity in spatial terms ) or Chinese medicine 's concern with regulating cold and heat , may be backed by crystal clear logical argument .  
Firstly , the Yin &amp; Yang principles described in the I-ching ( Classic of Changes ) can indicate many polarities such as the sun &amp; moon , day &amp; night , light &amp; dark , motion &amp; rest , internal &amp; external , cold &amp; heat , hard &amp; soft , and male &amp; female .  
These combinations seem to accord with common sense , for instance wood " rules " the direction East because growing trees like the sunlight and the sun rises in the east . Metal similarly " rules " the West since metal is by nature cold and dead , and the west is the direction of the setting sun and the lack of light which spells etiolation for plant life .  
Except for the spring and fall ancestral sacrifices and grave sweeping on the Ch'ing-ming festival , few people go there . Just one elderly Japanese quietly accompanies these homesick spirits in the cold winter months longing for a wind from their native land to the south . The Chinese have a saying that " a fallen leaf wants to return to its roots . "  
With rust-proof steel , plate glass , and glossy flat faces that looked like they had been cleaved with a knife , these plate glass buildings , rising like giant mirrors into the clouds , marked a new milestone in construction techniques . They are perfect company for the cold , rational , progressive sense of the modern city .  
The angry answer comes back that it is society 's search for simplistic explanations that is the problem and that , at his age , the youth is just discovering what a cold , shallow , arrogant culture he lives in - - where the worth of human beings is rated on the basis of the square footage of their homes , their net incomes and exam results , rather than on love and dignity .  
The most popular food for new mothers in Taiwan is sesame oil chicken . Chicken is the most digestible form of high-protein meat , while sesame oil is rich in vitamin E , calcium and iron and is said to help the uterus contract and eliminate lochia , or the discharge of blood , tissue and mucus after childbirth . The two main seasonings in sesame oil chicken - - ginger and rice wine - - are supposed to remove cold from the body and stimulate circulation .  
In fact , in one famous district in central Taiwan , a builder once advertised that a building would be equipped with cold storage for garbage , only to find that once the building was completed , the residents were unwilling to foot the extra electricity charge .  
Researchers have endeavored to find the reasons why grey mullet production has been unstable in recent years . One important discovery is that although the cold water mass from the mainland heads south to Taiwan , if it is n't sustained , which is to say if it does n't come far enough south , then it wo n't be strong enough to get into that push-pull dynamic with the Kuroshio Current , so that the fish will not form into schools . "  
It seems that Taichung has now become the " great grey mullet harbor . " This is also related to the fact that the cold fronts have not been able to come further southward . Improvements in fishing gear over the past few years , such as two boats cooperating to create a single large trap , increasing the horsepower of fishing boat motors , and improvements in two-way radios , have enabled the work of catching the fish in winter , unattainable in recent years , to go along swimmingly in the warmer weather .  
When the R . O . C . film The Wedding Banquet won top honors at the Berlin Film Festival , another feast for film lovers was opening back home . The films on offer here were black and white : pure and clean , yet warm and sweet . After a spell of cold and wet weather , the sun finally shows his face .  
And on sweltering summer days , people gather here to enjoy the cool shade . True , when that hard and cold cement road was paved just beyond the reach of its roots , it was a little uncomfortable , but for the most part it had nothing much to complain about . Enjoying largely mild weather , it has dug its roots deep and firm .  
Bob Yeh , managing director of the Meta Advertising Company , which handles the account for Shin Shii oolong tea , analyzes the reasons for failure at that time : First , Chinese who had long been accustomed to taking their tea hot could not immediately accept cold tea . There was a traditional belief that " tea left overnight produces poisons . " If tea is left to steep for a long time , it creates tannic acid , which causes the arteries to contract and makes digestion difficult .  
Fresh Pu'er tea is held by the Han people to be " bitter and cold . " Nonetheless , the minorities , with their sturdy physiques , usually just roast the leaves slightly , steep the tea and partake . Because of this , people who search the mountainous areas of Yunnan for genuine aged Pu'er are often greatly disappointed .  
Some calculating employees could tell that my husband was n't completely in support of me . To my surprise , they conspired to make my standing worse . Sometimes in public with a lot of people around , my husband scolded me , and after he left the room the employees treated my with a cold , haughty air .  
The hard-won joys of bird photographyPhotographing the black-faced spoonbill is arduous work . To avoid disturbing the birds , one must set up a hide in their habitat . Crouching in the camouflaged tent or wading through the black fetid mud with the cold seawater chilling one to the bone , exposed to the force of the bitter northeast wind , is something which is hard to describe with mere words to someone who has not experienced it himself .  
And so Chinese medicinal ingredients are rarely employed by themselves in singular attacks on a germ or ailment . Instead ingredients in prescriptions play one of four different roles : " monarch , minister , assistant or guide . " Based on the particulars of the illness and on whether the patient 's constitution is characterized by " insufficiency or excess , heat or cold , " the doctor will adjust the prescription .  
At this time the autumn farming activities went into a phase of decline , and in the north the weather turned cold . There was always some fear that barbarian tribes might " descend south to graze their horses . " At this time everyone began to brush up on their martial skills , even actively going out to kill the barbarians or steal the fat horses and goats that they raised !  
On this day they paid honor to the flag god and inspected the military troops . " Swords and spears bright as snow , banners bright and colorful " accompanied the cold , harsh autumn . It truly carried a sad chill : " The brave warrior goes off , never to return " !  
In northern Taiwan all the old farmers can recite the saying " Before the Awakening of Insects , do n't plant rice seedlings . " This is because the weather around the Awakening of Insects is just beginning to warm up but can still be a little chilly . If the first crop of seedlings is frozen by a late cold spell , then the farmers ' labors will be left unrewarded .  
Just a moment ago your bare arms and legs were a little numb from the cold air . Now they 're numb because the heat is making your blood vessels throb , and your whole body is limp . When you ca n't stand that hot current running through your body any longer , just splash yourself with some cold water .  
Seeing that few survivors remained of this isolated and precious " national treasure " fish , all of which could be wiped out by an unexpected cold spell , it was not enough to simply patrol the river and to educate citizens . The main effort to restore the salmon population became managed breeding .  
In the painting " Spring Thunder , " with the damp cold of its steely grey color scheme , a white flash of lightning steaks out from the left , while amid gusts of rain , plants bend rightward in the direction of the lightning .  
When cooking , the meat is first scalded in hot water and then immediately placed into cold water to cool it down , then slowly simmered over a low heat with a sachet of seasonings . Beef cooked in a clear broth in this way will be chewy and flavorsome , while the broth has a fresh meaty taste and there is no need at all to add MSG .  
The people complained that insurance premiums were too high . In the past an insurance policy allowed for free treatment ; now it has for no apparent reason taken a leap upward in cost due to the " partial cost sharing " regulation . And in the past you could go directly to a hospital to see a doctor with a good reputation for something as simple as a cold ; now with the medical referral system , you ca n't get through the front door .  
As the situation threatened to get out of control , Hsu Hsiao-ming broke out in a cold sweat . Under a blazing sun in Chiayi 's Tungshih , a fishing boat going out to sea was to be filmed for Tropical Fish . Chen Yu-hsun anticipated that the film crew might get seasick , so he gave everyone a motion sickness pill before departure . Maybe someone bought the wrong pills - - true , no one got seasick , but everyone became so drowsy that they spent the entire day sound asleep .  
What Mikes was referring to was the British way of drinking black tea with cold milk and no sugar : " Once this refreshing , aromatic , oriental beverage was successfully transformed into colourless and tasteless gargling-water , it suddenly became the national drink of Great Britain and Reland - - still retaining , indeed usurping , the high-sounding title of tea . "  
Coral reefs require clear , unpolluted water in shallow seas no deeper than 30 meters , so that the symbiotic algae can absorb enough light and the coral can feed on the organisms that float by . If the water 's too hot or too cold the coral will die . Warm waters of 20-30 year round are most suitable . The salinity of the water must be above 0.25% , and so reefs can not be close to the mouth of a river .  
Just as with the tea variety called " pearl tea " by the Chinese ( for the way the leaves are rolled into little round balls ) , but which in Britain was christened " gunpowder , " the old potters of Jingdezhen can never have imagined that when their pure white , smooth , cold porcelain arrived at the other side of the oceans it would have the magical power to stir up such burning desires in young men and women .  
This is the time of year when the weather is affected by cold high-pressure areas from the continent . These create sharp differences in temperature , generating strong upward currents . Also , humidity is low , and there is less concern about rain caused by hot air currents running into cold air at high altitudes .  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
On one occasion , a KMT candidate in the southern part of the island held an outdoor rally , but cold weather kept voters at home . Fortunately the 80-plus strong overseas support group showed up , saving the candidate from a rather embarrassing situation .  
Overall , in terms of cross-strait relations , Chen sees Lee 's inaugural address as being a moderate and not especially innovative speech , but it certainly did express a considerably friendly attitude and reopened the door to discussions . However , people should not expect any sudden breakthrough in cross-strait relations , because Taiwan and the PRC are in a " cold peace " situation , and there is no need to rush things .  
This time the main technical challenge was one of climate : Taiwan 's wet , sub-tropical climate differs vastly from the alternately humid and dry , cold and hot climate of southern Australia . But at least it has continual moisture , which does n't do as much damage as punctuated moisture .  
Several years ago it reached Fuhsing Rural Township to the north . Along the Northern Cross-Island Highway , the air turns cold early in the year , and this brings forward the harvest season of New Century pears , California plums , California honey plums , honey peaches and even kiwi-fruit . Thanks to the abundant sunshine , the quality of the fruit far surpasses that of other areas , and with Taiwan 's largest consumer market , Greater Taipei , close at hand , sales from the area have gradually taken off and overtaken Lishan .  
For the progress of their people , the educational workers of this mountainous area firmly man their posts , happy to lead simple , virtuous lives . Just like the orchid that attracts not the slightest attention , opening up little bright yellow blossoms under the cold wind and clamorous rain , they stand proud , refusing to bow their heads .  
Again , Xue Baocha should have made an ideal wife for the son of a family of high standing , but because she is unable to communicate with Jia Baoyu on a spiritual level , although she gains social rank , she finds no sympathetic resonance , but instead only a cold , empty shell .  
Driving south along the freeway , you leave behind moist northern Taiwan and reach the Huoyan Mountains of Miaoli County . This dry , barren land presents a scene of nothing but landslip-scarred brown earth . But the cold windward upper slopes of the mountains are the lonely stronghold of the " minority people " among Taiwan 's pines-the masson pine ( Pinus massoniana ) .  
The higher the elevation , the later the flowers bloom , and spring flowering species are also followed by summer flowering ones . On the 18th day of the 9th lunar month , in a cold dark forest where all the spring birds had fallen silent , Mei Yao-chen ( 1002-1060 ) of the Northern Song dynasty was delighted to chance upon rhododendron flowers with a color more splendid than the red of a dawn sky .  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
When we come to the Mennonite Christian Hospital in early December , a huge Christmas tree stands in the middle of the foyer of the newly completed hospital building . At the registration counter , in the consulting rooms , at the payment counter , at the pharmacy and even in the staff offices , everywhere is festooned with colored streamers , snowflakes and fairy lights . Instead of the cold , depressing atmosphere usually associated with hospitals , the place is full of the warm and festive spirit of Christmas .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
After cold fronts pass through , however , bird associations are always telling bird watchers to rush off to the seashore and mouths of rivers . If their luck is good , they may be able to see wild geese blown off course by the rough weather .  
As the structure of families and communities changes , the old intimate relations where one would raise the young and care for the old amid the sounds of cocks crowing and dogs barking have been replaced by cold impersonal relations in the urban sea of concrete buildings . As a result , many women have been confined to live lonely lives in their communities .  
At dawn , as the first sliver of the sun 's disc rises out of the sea , its rays strike the specially designed large windows of " Lion 's Kingdom . " Inside , several thousand stone lions have passed the night in lonely silence , but suddenly their round , staring eyes sparkle and come alive . As the exhibition room turns from darkness to light , the contours of their bodies , cold and hard in the blackness , become clear-cut and vital .  
A long table was filled with all kinds of dishes : deep-fried mahua ( dough twists ) , gangzitou ( hard wheatcakes ) , wheat-flour porridge , puffed-rice cakes , lardy rice , roasted sweet potatoes , cold noodles , huibing ( soft wheatcakes cut up and cooked in soup ) , dough drop soup , rice gruel with mung beans . . . .  
In recent years there have been a number of cases of foreign circuses on tour in Taiwan experiencing cash crises which led to animals being abandoned and left cold and hungry . The spring chicken chases held in some localities , in which the fowl are sent scurrying in all directions as people try to grab them , have also attracted accusations of animal abuse .  
After dinner there were further treats to pick up along the way , such as candied jujubes and sauce-stewed chicken and duck , as well as cold drinks such as ginger and honey cordial , sweet bean soup , purple perilla drink , and a sweat-inducing herbal beverage that was popular with the city 's pole-bearers as a form of " sports drink . "  
" He had absolutely no idea that his children all had to swallow their own share of hurt and disappointment while growing up , but never complained to him . Now each of them felt afresh the grievances of childhood , and began to strike back , one after another . " Li described the ensuing scenario : " Some wheeled out their heavy artillery and some used the machine-gun approach . Cannon and gunfire rang out on that cold rainy night , while tears flowed and fireworks exploded .  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
Anaphalis nepalensis ( 11 ) ( family Asteraceae ) is a typical Taiwanese alpine plant . It has a short stem , and the whole plant is covered in fluffy hairs and papery round flowers which give it excellent protection against the cold .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
When the weather in Taiwan 's low-lands begins to gradually turn cool , in the island 's high mountains the mercury is already plummeting , and all kinds of living things are getting ready for their winter rest . But despite the cold , high up on Mt . Hehuan , Yushan , Mt . Ali and elsewhere one can often see a unique Taiwanese bird species-the collared bush robin-hopping busily along the ground alone in search of food , like a solitary little knight-errant .  
As a result , a region that once had a very dry climate might experience frequent rains , or an area once known for its rains might cease to see any rainfall whatsoever . Under the influence of global warming , all kinds of strange meteorological phenomena might occur , including extreme cold alternating with extreme heat in one locale .  
Through satellite observations , the fishing industry has gradually come to understand the waxing and waning of cold and warm currents . Noting the succession of warm winters in the 1990s , and a 1 �X C rise in sea temperatures around Taiwan , the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute also began making fish catch forecasts based on sea temperatures . For instance , the temperature that best suits mullet is 21-23 �X C , but last year the institute predicted that sea temperatures around southern Taiwan would be 2-3 �X C warmer this winter than in previous years .  
He has written that he once went with a German friend to a recreational spot , and saw how this friend was absolutely delighted to see that the railings had been made out of rough , deep-green bamboo , only to find upon touching them that the sensation was of cold and clammy concrete .  
All types of fish that can be eaten raw have a fairly high fat content , but the bluefin is particularly famed for its fattiness . The Pacific bluefin that migrate through the waters east of Taiwan prefer lower water temperatures than other tuna , and usually stay north of the 18th parallel . To protect it from cold the Pacific bluefin has more fat than the yellowfin and albacore , which are distributed around the equator , or the southern bluefin , which lives in the southern hemisphere .  
Although they had not " done " anything , she broke out in a cold sweat . Her concern reminded me of the time a few years ago when I discovered a 15-year-old student whom I was tutoring engaged in a raucous game of mahjongg with three classmates , each of them accompanied by a girlfriend !  
An October weekend in Suzhou 's Mudu Town , there 's not a cloud in the sky but the cold wind chills to the bone . In order to control costs , the film crew for producer Young Pei-pei 's adapted script based on Gu Long 's famous martial arts novel Flying Sword Meets Flying Sword has divided into two groups who work in shifts from early morning to late at night .  
We witnessed how homeless people at Lungshan Temple died of cold when cold fronts swept through at Western New Year 's . The next day , the news was flooded with stories of celebrities and the details of their elegant New Year apparel ; even as frigid corpses lay in the street , the consumerist priorities of the global economy held sway , and only the goings-on of the rich were on people 's lips .  
In winter , the northeast monsoon makes for cold and wet weather with frequent fog and gusting rains on the northern side of the pass , while the southern side stays clear and dry . The very distinct climates make for radically different kinds of vegetation on the two sides of the pass .  
He once broke out with dermatitis while working on the eve of Chinese New Year . His entire body turned red and swelled , itching set in , and he had to soak all evening in a tub despite the cold winter weather . While everyone else was enjoying the most festive night of the year , Lai suffered through the bleakest New Year 's Eve of his life .  
Regrettably , even as the country was getting tough on domestic quarantine , in mid-May a doctor from Mackay Memorial Hospital caused an international incident when he showed SARS symptoms while in Japan . Assuming that he only had the flu , he took some cold medicine and finished his travel itinerary , only later discovering that one of the patients he treated in hospital later died as a probable SARS victim .  
The earliest tea in Taiwan was wild tea growing in the mountains around Puli , Nantou County . A small number of Aborigines also cultivated tea for medicinal purposes , but because under theories of Chinese medicine it was considered " cold , " it was not deemed suitable as a casual drink . Large-scale cultivation of tea began only with the arrival in Taiwan of immigrants from Anxi ( Fujian ) during the Qing Dynasty .  
In any case , the domestic tourist economy is rapidly gaining ground after its precipitous fall and entrepreneurs feel like they have jumped from the cold pool at a hot springs straight into the hot pool , going from one extreme to the other . Aside from SARS receding into the background and the approach of the summer holiday season , a new-found unity among tourism entrepreneurs has been a key element in the rapid resurgence of the industry .  
Apart from raising tinsmithing to the realm of art , he has been constantly tinkering , improving the properties of tin to make it stronger and harder , to allow it to keep its luster longer , and to give it a silky feel . He has also employed traditional casting , cold forging and detailed carving to expand its expressive abilities .  
The ancestors of this pint-sized member of the family Sylviidae ( the old-world warblers ) came from cold northern lands . Biogeographical evidence shows that they first spread out northeastward from the Himalayas into northern and northeastern China and Japan , and later moved south during the ice ages , reaching Taiwan via southern China or Japan .  
Whenever Huang Shu-hui thinks of the many cold winter evenings her mother spent in the homes of other people , huddled in front of the fire , she is moved to tears . This motivated her to be successful whatever the cost , so that her mother would never again have to live such a hard life .  
No matter whether modern or postmodern , classical or neoclassical , or an eclectic mix of old and new , restaurants in the " petty bourgeois " or " middle class " style are friendly , welcoming places , neither pretentiously modern in a cold and snooty way , nor self-consciously old school and superior . Taiwanese have long been good at creating this kind of atmosphere .  
In my youthful enthusiasm for that novel adventure I blithely forgot that I had always only barely made the grade in terms of physical fitness , and busily set about buying my first rucksack , my first pair of hiking boots , and a full set of warm outdoor clothes . In the biting cold of the seventh day of the lunar New Year , I excitedly set off on my first aeroplane flight , to Taichung where the group was to assemble .  
Yushan National Park is crowded with peaks , and crisscrossed by river valleys , making the terrain highly varied . Additionally , vegetation zones with hot , warm , cool , and cold climates can be found at different altitudes . As a result , except for the tropical plants along the coast , virtually all the types of vegetation found in Taiwan can be observed . It is little wonder that Yushan is such a haven for botanical researchers .  
One year , Kung planted his plots with a kind of mini-gourd , and the entire crop was hit by a mutation , causing the gourds to be more pear-shaped instead of their usual hourglass-like shape . He took this mutant variety in to a seed company , who discovered after some trials that that variety of mini-gourd was particularly susceptible to mutation in cold temperatures-Kung had planted them during winter . The seed company planted another row during summer , which produced gourds of the normal shape .  
Lu Ming-fong says , " If we combine genetic research with traditional Chinese medicine we will make the road ahead much shorter . " Traditional Chinese medicine divides the human organism into the five different phases , or constitutions , of metal , wood , water , fire , and earth . Genes also show that different people have different constitutions . For example , it appears that people with cardiovascular diseases rarely get cancer , because heart disease is what Chinese medicine calls a " hot " condition , whereas cancer is a " cold " one .  
He does n't rest easy until his ink has finished drying . In Taiwan , the best time of year for making ink runs from the eighth month of the lunar calendar through the second month of the following year , when the weather is relatively cool and there is little rain . The best ink is made in the winter because the ink blocks shrink in the cold , dry quickly , and keep their shape .  
A few extra charcoal blocks are thrown on the fire to boil water and provide heat . Although the temperature in Taiwan 's plains can go as high as 30oC in late May , when night comes , it falls to 4-5oC on the north peak and there is often a strong cold wind . Sweaters , hats and thick socks are basic requirements all year round . " Not until November 1997 did a helicopter bring the first load of charcoal to the Yushan Weather Station , " says Hsieh .  
Helanshan Mountain , extending more than 250 kilometers to the north and south , is situated in the border area of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia , two large autonomous regions .  It is an important natural and geographical border , a water resource conservation forest and a natural ecological defense for the attacks of Tenggeli desert and Siberia cold wave .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .  
The Helan Mountain Range , about 250 kilometers long , extends from south to north along the common border of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia . It is an important natural geographical demarcation line in northwestern China as well as a water conservatory forest area .  The mountain range is also a natural protective shield , which stops the Tenger desert from expanding to the east and the inroad of Siberian cold current .  
Mt . Helan , stretching more than 250 km from south to north , is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia , the two large autonomous regions .  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China , it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current .  
li also briefed the russian guests on china 's foreign policies he said that after the cold war , the world is facing a multi polarization trend yet the world is not peaceful new conflicts and contradictions keep occurring the gap between the north and the south is further enlarged , li said  
He explained that the meeting of transient cold weather and warm and damp air mass , which is comparatively active this winter , has brought about the two snowfalls , which are bound to bring down the temperature in the Beijing area  
Notwithstanding the positive initiative taken by the major nuclear Powers since the end of the cold war , there is still a need to establish a close link between disarmament and international peace in the years ahead .  
The end of the cold war , the emerging enhanced role of the United Nations and the prevailing political climate of conciliation create an ideal environment for an effective effort to achieve permanent solutions to long-standing problems .  
Thus , despite the deep-rooted and persistent social and institutional factors that have long affected the country , there is reason to hope that in the not-too-distant future this situation which to a certain extent is a remnant of the cold war will be rectified , leading to the achievement of the permanent peace which remains the most fervent hope of the people of Guatemala .  
In addition , temporary expedients such as putting " cold " surgery on waiting lists , making real reductions in services in some fields , such as paying for surgery and not internal medicine , and reducing the level of reimbursement of patients ' hospital bills and " capping " the total amounts have all been applied .  
Nevertheless , the systematic abuse of human rights which tactical allies were allowed to engage in , and which also characterized the Soviet Union and its areas of influence , reduced the ethical quality of the world inherited after the ending of the cold war .  
But what would it have been like had the United Nations not existed to channel activities for peace , to oversee the post-war period and the cold war , to give its moral sanction to the emancipation of peoples , to coordinate assistance for economic and social development and to set a moral standard and order relations among nations and human beings ?  
Despite the end of the cold war , which has lessened the probability of nuclear conflict , the Earth continues to be an arena of murderous conflicts that cause unspeakable suffering and vast humanitarian tragedies .  
The end of the East-West bipolarity that plagued the world during the cold war and the disappearance of the ideological demarcation line that divided the world into two camps should prompt us to seize this historic opportunity afforded us by the current transitional period to lay down new foundations for North-South cooperation and to narrow the economic gap between them .  
Moreover , while the threat of a major international confrontation has receded with the end of the cold war , a host of other problems , including an upsurge in inter-State conflicts , international terrorism , growing poverty and marginalization of vast segments of humanity in the developing countries as well as within affluent societies , are coming to the fore .  
This fiftieth anniversary is indeed cause for celebration : United Nations membership has grown from 51 States to 185 ; the old colonial empires , as we all know , have been dismantled , even if new forms are emerging ; the cold war may seem to be at an end , though many of us are still living with its very painful legacies ; and issues of the environment , women and children , social development and population have been placed at the centre of the development agenda .  
The cold war is over , the geopolitical map has been radically altered , a worldwide democratization process has emerged , cooperation has replaced confrontation and a globalization process has begun in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres .  
In fact , although the changes that took place in the wake of the cold war led to a certain easing in international relations and promoted , as never before , democratic values , the international situation nevertheless has continued to deteriorate in recent times in the political , economic , social and financial spheres .  
Today we can say that in the 1990s , with the end of the cold war and the breakdown of totalitarianism , an unprecedented opportunity presented itself to change the course of history and , for the first time , to secure the values of a democratic , just , peaceful , civil and reconciled society , with Governments brought to power by the freely expressed will of the people .  
Owada ( Japan ) : The fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations , coming as it did in the midst of the structural changes that are taking place in the world in the wake of the end of the cold war , has offered us a golden opportunity for sober reflection upon the role of the United Nations in the contemporary international system .  
The increase in the number of Member States to 185 ; the end of the cold war and the concomitant , regrettable radicalization of nationalism and group identity , which cause internal and inter-State conflicts ; and the perverse effects of the economic and financial crisis on the democratization of institutions and on human rights all these events and challenges highlight the urgent need to carry out a reform of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular . 
The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that the United Nations , freed from nuclear and ideological confrontation , would devote its full attention to building a peaceful and more equitable world ; tackle the challenge of world poverty ; advance regional conflicts to resolution ; distribute the benefits of peace dividends ; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized premises of the Charter , especially with regard to collective security . 
" Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .  
Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
The Government of Cuba stressed that despite the end of the cold war , certain Powers , based on their predominant position in the world economy , have continued to use coercive economic measures against developing countries .  
It was further suggested that the end of the cold war , the growing integration of the world economy and the emerging consensus on development policies seemed to have created a propitious confluence of forces in favour of a constructive and non-confrontational dialogue designed to meet the global challenges of poverty and development in a rapidly changing international environment .  
NULLWe note with satisfaction that today , now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the " cold war " has ended , new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element . 
These obstacles must be analysed in the context of international political and economic relations characterized by the globalization of the economy and in a specific historical context marked by the end of the cold war and East-West confrontation , the emergence of regional economic groupings and the concentration of economic , financial and technological power in the hands of a limited number of countries .  
was important to recognize that security was no longer defined as it had been in the cold war era : security was currently threatened by socio-economic problems - massive migrations , global epidemics and environmental degradation - which could only be resolved in the interest of all countries by multilateral action .

Despite the end of the cold war , regional , religious and ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in various parts of our planet , and consequently world peace and security are gravely disturbed and peoples are suffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them .  
Turkey and the pseudo-state , taking advantage of a peaceful demonstration by Greek Cypriots , proceeded a few weeks ago , with the active involvement of the extremist terrorist Turkish group the Grey Wolves , to implement a meticulously prepared plan which was crowned by the murder in cold blood of two young Cypriots and the injuries sustained by many others , United Nations peacekeepers included .  
The relevant provisions of the Summit 's final document , agreed at the highest level , could play a most important role in the positive development of negotiations both within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other current mediatory efforts of the OSCE . For several years since the end of the cold war active discussions have been taking place in the world on the transformation of international relations .  
But how many millions of these cold , cruel and silent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent civilian population in remote areas of the country near the western border ? 
The Social Summit expressed the political will to take advantage of a window of opportunity that has opened in the world with the end of the cold war to let in fresh air and to overcome the age-old ideological intolerance and rivalries of power politics , which were impediments to true international solidarity and served only selfish self-interest .  
That positive development the end of the cold war also encouraged many in the developing world , especially those of us in Africa , to undertake far-reaching political and economic reform measures , with a view to laying the foundation for democratic transformation and meaningful economic growth and development .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
While others were progressing , we were stagnating , locked in a cruel domestic struggle that included elements imported from the cold war , which arbitrarily kept in check for 40 years our political , social and economic evolution .  
But how many millions of these cold , cruel and silent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent civilian population in remote areas of the country near the western border ? 
The United States is becoming more undisguised in its moves to build up a " tripartite military alliance " with Japan and south Korea , and moves forward on a full scale with the reintroduction of its cold war era policy to the Korean peninsula and its vicinity , by repeatedly launching joint military exercises among the United States , south Korea and Japan over the so-called " north Korea 's threat " .  
Although the political environment since the end of the cold war had favoured international cooperation in the utilization of outer space , the level of cooperation remained unsatisfactory ; there was a reluctance to share space benefits because of the huge outlay involved .  
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
There were also those who considered that , in view of the time that has elapsed since the adoption of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the profound and far-reaching changes that have transformed the international security landscape since the end of the cold war era , and the advent of a new century , profitable use could be made of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to review and assess progress towards the " grand vision " and programme of action of the Final Document .  
As to the nature and causes of small arms ' destabilizing accumulation and transfer , in his January 1994 Supplement to an Agenda for Peace , the Secretary-General identified four basic reasons : earlier supply during the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets and criminal activity combined with the collapse of governmental law and order .  
The veto power , flawed in principle as it was and remains , may have had a useful purpose during the cold war era , but with the improved international environment and , indeed , the increase of diplomatic avenues to resolve differences , the continued existence of the veto is as undemocratic as it is irrelevant .  
Although significant progress had been made in the field of human rights , particularly in the eradication of apartheid and the adoption of conventions protecting the human rights of women and children , the enjoyment of political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights was far from being universal , and it was regrettable that the end of the cold war had not brought about an improvement in the situation .  
AYEWAH ( Nigeria ) said that the rapid expansion of United Nations peacekeeping operations since the end of the cold war reflected the belief in such operations as an effective instrument for stabilizing , containing and helping to resolve conflicts which undermined confidence among States and endangered international peace and security .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
Some people have thought that the end of the so-called cold war would be conducive to the creation of favourable conditions for equitable and healthy international relations based on mutual respect and fruitful and constructive cooperation among human communities .  
When an exceptionally cold winter in the northern hemisphere raised demand , inventories were allowed to fall as the industry expected that Iraq would resume exporting oil under Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , in which the Council authorized States to permit the import of petroleum and petroleum products originating in Iraq , sufficient to produce a sum not exceeding a total of US $ 1-billion every 90 days .  
At police stations , the forms of torture and ill-treatment reported include kicking ; beating ; application of electric shocks by means of batons or small electrical generators ; the use of self-tightening handcuffs ; deprivation of food ; exposure to alternating extremes of hot and cold temperatures ; enforced standing in difficult positions ; enforced standing in cold water ; prolonged shackling of detainees spread-eagled to a wall ; placing of heated objects on the skin ; and striking with iron rods on the joints or hands .  
Nevertheless , these decisive changes did not come about easily and had to make their way within an extremely hostile international setting marked by the cold war , and at a time when the so _ called national security doctrine was becoming established in many developing countries and across virtually the whole of the American continent .  
This is both a theoretical and political challenge as these rights were formulated in a context that was totally different economically and above all politically : the post-war period , the cold war , the existence of a socialist bloc and of competitive capitalism based on strong nation states .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
Our expectations , in the wake of the cold war , for the establishment of international peace and security and social and economic prosperity for humanity have not yet been fulfilled , because of continued civil and regional wars .  
Though the end of the cold war has greatly reduced the threat of another global war , which twice in this century brought untold sorrow to mankind , intra-country conflicts and civil wars continue to wreak havoc in several countries , with resultant loss of lives , destruction of national infrastructure , displacement of innocent persons and outflow of refugees into neighbouring countries .  
All of this madness has revived official and covert operations , mercenaries , spies and assassins , as ready now as in the worst days of the cold war to plot and unleash terror against human beings and even employ aggressive biological agents against our economy .  
In the twentieth century brutal local and global conflicts , the development and use of the cruellest weapons , the attempted extermination of entire peoples and a seemingly endless cold war gave credibility to the nightmare visions of that earlier generation .  
In spite of the major political changes around the world , characterized , inter alia , by the end of the cold war and the promising prospects for the settlement of several regional conflicts , and in spite of formidable advances in science and technology , the fact remains that the hopes raised by this dynamic have not had the positive results we had hoped for in the social sphere .  
The cold war had just ended , and barriers both real and perceived were falling , paving the way for precisely this type of treaty negotiated on a multilateral basis , as opposed to the bipolar accords with which the world was more familiar .  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
Generally speaking , the capitalist revolution ( free-market reforms and well-conceived and prudently implemented privatization in the post cold war period ) has increased foreign investment , streamlined the public sector and reduced inflation , bringing about a significant level of stability and prosperity .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
The cold war , represented by the zero-sum game mentality , where some gain at the expense of others , is giving way to more positive trends and constructive attitudes , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world based on advancing the interests of all .  
Against the backdrop of the end of the cold war and the diminished possibility of global nuclear confrontation , the Board discussed the security consequences of economic globalization , the lessening of the importance of national boundaries and the increase in intra-State conflict and illicit trafficking in small arms and other criminal activities .  
It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
To them the end of the cold war simply dictated changes in the positioning of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and the taking of steps to develop new nuclear-weapon systems to meet the geopolitical requirements of the new international system .
