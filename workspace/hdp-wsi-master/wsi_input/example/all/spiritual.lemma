Pop queen Madonna 's upcoming spiritual tour to Israel to study a mysterious Jewish philosophy has raised questions over her true faith .  Does the self-proclaimed material girl really have faith in the traditional ancient Jewish mysticism or is this simply the latest fashion of self-help for celebrities .  
The CPC Central Commission for Guiding the Spiritual Civilization Building held its seventh plenary session today to study the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important directive on strengthening and improving the ideological and political work , and to make work arrangements for further reinforcing the building of socialist spiritual civilization and for earnestly grasping the party 's ideological and political work under the present new situation .  
regard it a major and urgent task to strengthen and improve the party 's ideological and political work , and see to it that the task can run through every aspect of the spiritual civilization building ; strive for tangible results with earnest efforts ; and provide both a strong spiritual driving force and a powerful ideological guarantee for accelerating reform and development , and for maintaining social stability .  
Since our party represents the direction of the development of the advanced culture , all comrades of the party must always take Marxism as the guidance , strive to inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , and strive to learn from and absorb all outstanding cultural achievements of foreign countries in order to continuously create and promote the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , enable the coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilization , and enable comprehensive progress of the society .  
regard the ideological and political work as the essential among essentials ; grasp the work firmly , create a sound atmosphere , and carry out the work in a down-to-earth manner ; and provide a strong spiritual motive power and a powerful ideological guarantee for our efforts to promote the development of reform and maintain the stability of the society .  
We should keep to a correct orientation in our work , give wide publicity to the main theme of our time , carry forward and develop healthy trends in society , and occupy the front of mass culture with healthy and beneficial activities .  Exhibition halls , museums , science museums , libraries , cultural centers , cinemas , entertainment venues , and tourist spots are all required to propagate a spiritual civilization , oppose feudal and superstitious ideas , and resist vulgar interests .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin sent a letter to the National Conference on Popularizing Science , pointing out : We must strengthen in real earnest the work of popularizing science by taking it as an important task aimed at implementing the strategy of " national rejuvenation through science and education " and as an important content of socialist spiritual civilization building ; should energetically popularize scientific knowledge in the whole society ; and should advocate the spirit of science ; publicize scientific thinking ; and disseminate scientific measures ;  
The members of Jingyang County 's leading group said : In the past , we always thought economic work meant inflexible tasks and targets while the party building and the building of spiritual civilization were flexible tasks , dealing with ideological work , not " grain production . "  So , we did not have a profound understanding of the principle of " building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both " and our understanding of it was lopsided .  
Fourth , all localities in Guangdong must constantly enhance the ideological and ethical qualities , as well as the scientific and cultural qualities , of the people ; strengthen the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and bring about a well-coordinated economic and social development .  
Once we have advanced productive forces and an advanced social system , we can create more and better material and spiritual wealth ; can get a firm foothold , and can march at the head in our competition with different countries and different forces ; and can develop greater power to enhance the comprehensive national strength of our country .  
Only by continuously developing socialist culture and continuously satisfying the masses growing need for spiritual and cultural life can we provide a powerful spiritual drive and guarantee the development of productive forces .  
Some delegates indicated : During the current building of a spiritual civilization , the trend of promoting material progress to the neglect of cultural and ideological progress has yet to be checked permanently , and a major factor leading to such a situation is that the related legislation work remains relatively weak ; in view of such a problem , we ought to vigorously strengthen the legislation concerning the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .  
the building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and legal system was further intensified ; and social stability was maintained .  These achievements are the results of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core taking charge of the overall situation and providing correct leadership , and the results of all levels throughout the country implementing the central policy decision on expanding domestic demand and the series of guidelines and policies , and working hard with concerted efforts .  
Departments of spiritual promotion and cultural education must organize and guide a large batch of artistic workers and scientific promotion workers to go deep into the frontline of the socialist reform and modernization construction .  They should absorb nourishment and find materials there , create high-quality spiritual products and meet people 's demand for improving their quality of spiritual civilization .  
We must solidly and deeply launch the mass campaign of the exploration and construction of spiritual civilization and comprehensively conduct promotion and education , among all of the people , on scientific perspective on the world and methodology .  We must form a healthy atmosphere , in the entire society , which opposes superstition and ignorance and resists various false reasoning and heretical ideas .  We must continuously improve the masses ' ideological and moral levels and establish good spiritual habits .  
Guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , ideological and political work has always accompanied the party 's founding , development , maturing , and strengthening ; it has become the fine tradition and political strong point of the CPC members in uniting for struggle , conquering difficulties , and winning victory , and has become the party 's " magic weapon " in gathering together the spiritual force of the Chinese nation .  
Faced with the new situations and problems that have emerged in market economy , in accordance with the demands of the central authorities , the central departments concerned and many localities have engaged in bold exploration and practice , and regarded mass activities to build spiritual civilization as an important carrier for ideological and political work ; they have attached importance to the social education function of culture , and paid attention to giving play to the demonstration role of advanced typical examples .  
The content of the proposals is mainly : Maintaining sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , expanding domestic demand , promoting strategic economic restructuring , continuing to push ahead with reform and strengthening management , speeding up the development of science and technology and education , opening wider to the outside world , intensifying the building of a social security system , stepping up environmental protection , and strengthening the building of spiritual civilization and an honest and clean government .  
2 .  Article Three of General Work Principles shall be amended as " The national committee and local committees of CPPCC shall implement the strategy of running the country in accordance with the law ; publicize and enforce ( carry out ) the constitution , laws , and various principles and policies of the state ; and mobilize social forces to actively take part in the cause of building material civilization and socialist spiritual civilization ( assist the state organs in cracking down on criminal activities aimed at sabotaging socialism in economic field and other fields ) . "  
While creating a model street for the " no fake goods in malls and shops " activity , Hunan Road of Gulou District in Nanjing City incorporated ideological and political work as well as spiritual civilization construction into commercial enterprise management and business operation in a lively and tangible manner , producing a set of experiences in double civilizations construction and turning a shabby , cluttered , and unknown street into a golden business location , a shopping paradise , and a national model street of no fake goods in just a few years .  
Deputy Huang Qifan said : To act as the representative of the advanced productive forces and to be the direction of an advanced culture , it is necessary to continuously forge ahead and perform new meritorious deeds , concentrate our energies on the economic development and the building of spiritual civilization , and accomplish comprehensive and harmonious social development .  
With the support of the party and the state and through their own hard work , people in Tibet have changed the situation of poverty , backwardness , and ignorance left by Tibet 's old society .  Together with people of fraternal nationalities , the Tibetan people have realized happiness in their lives and are seeking modern material civilization and spiritual civilization .  
At the same time when we uphold economic construction as the central task , we must also make earnest efforts to step up the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and must bring about a comprehensive progress to both the material productive forces of our society and the ideology , ethics , and culture of our society .  The position of economic construction as a central task should remain unshaken at all times ;  
ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development ; truly step up building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and a legal system ; and endeavor to accomplish all tasks set forth by the current NPC session .  
Only when we continuously develop socialist culture and improve socialist spiritual civilization continuously can we provide a powerful spiritual dynamic force and intellectual support to economic development and overall social progress and can we continuously meet the increasingly growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
In recent years , the military 's literary and artistic workers have been conforming to the spirit of President Jiang 's directive that the military 's construction of spiritual civilization must take the lead in the whole society .  Through assiduous efforts , they have created a large group of literary and artistic works loved by troops ' rank and file and the people .  
In general , in literary and artistic creativity , the military must continue to carry forth a major theme while advocating diversification .  The military must encourage and support literary and artistic workers to go deep into troops ' lives and into the lives of the rank and file , to create excellent works reflecting the spirit of our times and encouraging the rank and file to go all out to make progress , and to provide more and better spiritual food for the broad number of commanders and soldiers .  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
With reference to the new developments in situations at home and abroad , the new developments in productive forces and the new situations occurring in economic structural reform , the new requirements of the masses of people for their material and cultural life , and the new changes taking place within the contingents of party members and cadres under the new situation , we must earnestly study , deeply understand , and wholly and accurately master the spiritual essence of this important thinking .  
However , while liberating and developing social productive forces , we must also handle numerous issues about production relations and superstructures , especially those issues in the ideological and cultural realms and must let the building of material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization coordinately develop .  
Only by developing productive forces and flourishing socialist culture can we provide powerful material and spiritual bases for realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
disseminated , in a vivid way , the materialist ideological concept of respecting science and opposing superstition among the vast number of the visitors ; helped people see more clearly the true nature and the harms of such religious cults as the " Falungong " ; and will thus prove a great help to enhancing the spiritual civilization and the scientific attainment of our people .  
Therefore , to stabilize the birthrate , we must persistently focus our attention on people ; under the general situation of the country 's social and economic growth , devote great efforts to eliminate those economic , social , and natural conditions which may affect people 's concept on child birth ; and provide a sufficient material guarantee and a strong spiritual driving power for the change in people 's concept on child birth .  
and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
In our country , now tourism has been moving onto the path of comprehensive development with three major market sectors , namely , tourism for people entering the Chinese mainland , domestic tourism , and tourism for domestic people traveling abroad , and now tourism is a large-scale industry with a huge market and great output value .  Tourism is playing a more and more important role in the national economy , and is producing positive influence for the enhancement of national quality and the development of the socialist spiritual civilization .  
On the one hand , hostile forces in the West are still bent on " Westernizing " and " dividing " us and they try their utmost to step up ideological and cultural infiltration through a multitude of channels .  They publicize capitalist values in the large volumes of imported publications , film and television products , electronic games , computer software , and other spiritual and cultural products in an effort to compete with us for the younger generation .  
The above-mentioned " Opinion " points out : Over the past five decades following the founding of New China , especially since the start of reform and opening-up , the social welfare work in this country has made considerable progress and played a positive role in building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  As far as our old-age population is concerned , however , we have a large base figure , and the number of old people is still increasing at a rapid pace .  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
The 10-year history of Pudong development also demonstrates the adherence to the strategy of Emphasizing both on economy and ideology and of the ideological education of stressing both spiritual civilization and material civilization as a key reason of the successful development of Pudong . The adherence also is the guarantee of a Party free of corruption , and of a fine social mood .  The Pudong development project stuck to the principle of To accelerate the first-class development project with first-class Party construction .  
As a result of over 20 years of reform and development , there has been great improvement of our comprehensive national strength , social productive forces , and people 's living standards ; we have progressed by leaps and bounds in building socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and legal system ; and the whole world has seen the great vitality and vigor demonstrated by socialism in China .  
Ideological-political work and economic construction must be grasped simultaneously .  This is our party 's consistent policy , which reflects the dialectical unity between economic foundation and superstructure and gives expression to the fundamental need of balanced development of material and spiritual civilization and all-round social progress .  
In short , we must , under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels , carry out vigorous ideological-political work to explain and answer the masses ' questions , resolve contradictions , straighten out their feelings , coordinate interest relationship , bring about cohesion , and mobilize all positive factors .  Only by so doing can we provide our country 's reform , opening up , and modernization with powerful spiritual motive force and ideological safeguards ; can our economic construction advance in a healthy and smooth way .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " including not only the booming and forceful songs for marching drills but also the cordial and moving songs for expressing one 's feelings and the lively and impassioned songs for collectively singing in a sing-and-response style , displays through many forms the spiritual outlook and the plain but heartfelt feelings that are unique in our military officials and soldiers .  The words and music of these songs directly relate to the lives of grassroots officials and soldiers and are concise , easily understood , musical and easily disseminated .  
By learning and singing these songs , we aim to strengthen the spiritual backbone of revolutionary military professionals , to improve the moral quality of the broad number of officials and soldiers , and to enable them to receive education , to purify their spiritual world , mold their attitude and improve their conscientiousness through aesthetic educational activities conducted in a way that influences their environment .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
Last year , after conducting research it proposed : The evil religion peddles spiritual opium in the guise of " making one into a Buddha or celestial being " , thus achieving the goal of opposing the government and society .  Therefore , thoroughly exposing and criticizing , and resolutely resisting all kinds of crooked reasons and heretical ideas are important tasks in strengthening ideological and political construction .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
To strengthen ideological and political education is of extremely great significance to upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army , stepping up our army 's revolutionization , modernization and regularization , providing a strong spiritual motive force for " winning in war " , and providing a political guarantee for " being immune to degeneration " .  
The issues of belief and conviction involve many major issues including our guiding thought , social system , cadres ' contingent building , as well as people 's thinking that have a bearing on the rise and fall and success and failure of our party .  Faced with tough challenges in the new millenium , and at a time of comprehensively pushing forward our cause into the new century , we need a strong spiritual force even more .  
Only Marxism discovered for the first time the law of development of human society , namely existence decides consciousness , material production decides spiritual production , economic foundation decides super structure , the relations between productive force and production and the contradictions between economic foundation and superstructure push social progress .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
At a gathering in Guangzhou on 18 May for the destruction of smuggled and pirated CD 's on an unprecedented scale , Yu Youxian , director of the Press and Publication Administration and also director of the State Copyright Bureau , vehemently declared : " In the contest of all-round national strength today , and especially in the future , the main and most reliable resource for the Chinese nation is our own spiritual innovative ability ; it is precisely our national spiritual innovative ability that is harmed by infringement of copyright and pirating . "  
Focusing on and serving this center of economic construction , constantly strengthening and improving the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization to fully display its role of clearing up doubts , remove apprehensions , and inspire spirit can vigorously safeguard and promote the building and development of the socialist material civilization .  
Nevertheless , it should also be noticed that some leading cadres still do not have sufficient understanding about the importance of ideological and political work and that they grasp economic work in a relatively solid way but grasp the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization in a relatively vague way .  
We should make full use of these favorable conditions , adhere to the mass line , fulfill the work amid the actual activities of the material and spiritual productions of the masses of the people , let ideological education run through the handling of solid affairs , and guide the masses to enhance their spiritual realm through resolving realistic problems .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , many developments have taken place in their spiritual and cultural life and the masses have proposed new demands for spiritual and cultural life .  This requires that we profoundly study the characteristics of the times , have a firm grip on the times , and continuously probe for new forms , methods , means , and mechanisms .  And this is the key to making ideological and political work more purposeful and more inspiring .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .  
Socialist spiritual civilization is being developed more and more effectively , and comprehensive social progress is being made .  The progressive socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is turning into a great mental force rallying the Chinese nation as a whole .  
They should transform concern from the Party , the central government and the Central Military Commission into the powerful impetus of self-strengthening and self-sufficiency , struggling to press their way forward with a pioneering spirit and with courageous contributions .  They should become an advanced collective that makes contributions to constructing our country 's material and spiritual civilizations .  
Each region must pay thorough attention to developing spiritual and cultural products and healthy entertainment activities that have the ability to imperceptibly influence people 's ideological views and moral sentiments so as to allow the masses to achieve enlightenment and mold their sentiments in a relaxed and happy atmosphere .  
cherish the current gratifying reform , opening-up , and modernization situation ; and initiate what is useful to the Internet and do away with the harmful while performing their duties .  Only by so doing will we be able to actually make contributions to the construction of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and to pioneer a vast , unlimited path for the development of China 's Internet .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
This requires that creators of literary and artistic works should persistently focus on realistic topics when choosing between historical and realistic ones , and focus on military-oriented topics when choosing between military-oriented topics and non-military ones .  These creators should be enthusiastically concerned about the great process of military construction , firmly take the pulse of life in military camps , and make our excellent spiritual products the satisfactory guide in creating literary and artistic works .  
and to check corruption , one should stand up for healthy trends " .  Only when we arm the minds of the vast numbers of party-member cadres with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and only when we educate and guide them to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values , can they develop a strong spiritual pillar , a correct understanding of right and wrong , and an effective political immunity .  
They should learn their lofty passion of fighting for the motherland , their fighting will for struggling persistently and their spiritual attainment of continuous pursuit .  Officers and soldiers throughout the military and the armed police forces should , as the athletes have done , work hard in training , make unswerving efforts , be brave in struggling for " gold medals " in their own posts , and accomplish more magnificent achievements for the People 's Republic of China .  
Since the implementation of the " Ninth Five-Year " Plan , we have scored glorious achievements in promoting spiritual civilization , while attaining tremendous successes in developing material civilization .  All this has provided a gigantic spiritual motive force and a strong ideological guarantee for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , precisely because of the adoption of the principle of persistently carrying out reforms and opening up , we can score today 's brilliant achievements in the development of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and our party can withstand the tests of various difficulties and risks .  The socialist system in our country can also gain strong vigor and dynamism under the eventful and changing international situation .  
Dialectical materialism adheres to the unity of material and spirit , emphasizes the decisive role played by material product in the social development and gives full light to the active role played by spiritual strength in the course where people reconstruct the objective world .  
The spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will is the precious spiritual wealth made by the Party and the military through prolonged revolutionary and construction practices as well as the embodiment of the positive spiritual state of both Party members and revolutionary military professionals .  
As students of military academies , we shoulder the historic mission of relying on science and technology to build a strong army and accelerate the modernization of our army 's armament and equipment .  We must more consciously strengthen our cultivation of Marxist theories and scientific spirit , arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge , and exert to spread the fruits of socialist spiritual and cultural progress .  We must never allow fallacies of " Falungong " to contaminate our sacred school campuses .  
Countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals would dedicate everything in them to liberating the Chinese nation , bringing happiness to the people and revitalizing the country .  The reform , opening up and the development of the socialist market economy have added enormous vitality and historical progress to our construction of material and spiritual civilizations .  
The spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is incompatible with those corrupt ideas by nature .  Vigorously promoting this spirit can effectively sweep away such corruption and enable us to maintain a strong will to fight , to maintain lofty ideas , firm stances and the correct direction so as to formulate spiritual strengths , values and public opinions beneficial to the reform and construction .  
Without the lofty ideal of being unselfish , afraid of nothing and ethical in fulfilling one 's official duties , could we maintain the political quality of the people 's army and walk at the cutting edge of society as a whole in the socialist spiritual civilization construction despite the infiltration of money worship , hedonism and extreme individualism ?  
In the face of the ever-changing international situation and intense international competition , without a lofty idea , firm conviction and powerful spiritual mainstay , it is impossible for comrades of the entire party and people throughout the country to make our country powerful , invigorate our nation and basically realize our socialist modernization in the middle of this century .  Without a strong rallying power and brilliant creativity , it is impossible for them to do so .  Without an indomitable will and concerted efforts , it is also impossible for them to do so .  
Firm ideals and convictions are the ideological basis of assuring our revolutionary military professionals are politically qualified and maintaining their essential qualities and the spiritual backbone and resources for these professionals to live through tests , overcome difficulties and make achievements in their careers .  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
In conducting major military exercises , combating floods of three rivers and going to the rescue hurriedly in 1998 , holding the grand military parade of the century , marching into Hong Kong and Macao and stationing there to perform defensive duties , our army has demonstrated its spiritual outlook of being courageous , indomitable , and invincible and the good image of being a mighty and civilized army .  
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
In light of China 's national conditions and according to the people 's wishes , the Chinese government aims to build a democratic and modernized country with a high level of civilization under the rule of law , and actively learn from the beneficial experiences and cultural achievements of other countries .  While maintaining social stability , it also aims to expedite development , strengthen the democratic legal system , promote spiritual civilization , and continuously push forward the development of the human rights cause .  
They should unite more closely around the party CentralCommittee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner ofDeng Xiaoping Theory , seriously implement the important thinking of " threerepresents , " strengthen the party building and improve the ideological andpolitical levels of the military , and provide a powerful spiritual motivationand reliable political guarantee for " winning in wars " and " neverdegenerating . "  
Huzhou City Mayor Huang Kunming said : Comrade Wang Wei has left precious spiritual wealth for the people of Huzhou . We will publicize his strong patriotic and collective spirit among the cadres and masses of Huzhou , turn the inspired patriotic passion into strength for building up our country , and , by working harder , quicken the pace of economic development and build up China 's national strength .  
Once people practice Falungong , they would place themselves under the control of the cult 's tightly knitted organization and its cruel spiritual shackles .  Gradually the practitioners would become depressed and apathetic , with no sense of responsibility toward society and family .  After losing their basic human nature , obsessed Falungong practitioners could become extraordinarily cruel and violent and could do incredible things .  
The " three represents " advocates the realm of a communist 's lofty thought , which is going with development of productive forces , advocating advanced cultures , and giving primary consideration in all ways to the interests of the people .  This spirit is a powerful spiritual driving force for us to ensure thorough implementation of all work and to truthfully realize the demand that the party exercises absolute leadership over the military .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that in the entire process of the modernization of Shanghai , it is necessary to adhere to the principle of laying equal emphasis on both material and spiritual civilizations , and be strong in both , further strengthen the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , democracy and legal system , and promote comprehensive social progress .  
Zeng Qinghong pointed out : In commanding various rural work with the important thinking of " three represents , " we must devote major efforts to advancing the building of socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and the legal system and safeguarding social stability in the countryside to provide an ideological guarantee and good sociopolitical environment for rural economic and social development .  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
The Chinese working class is indeed the representative of advanced social productive forces and production relations , is indeed the basic driving force that promotes social development and historical advances , is indeed the main force in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and is indeed the leading class of the people 's republic .  
The fine traditions and the fine work style of our army are the precious spiritual wealth , as well as the source of the invincible power , of our army ; and this military history is therefore required to fully embody the glorious traditions and the fine work style of our army , so that it can be used as a good teaching material for our education on traditions among our troops .  
The basic question of the trade union work is an issue of safeguarding rights .  All work of the trade union should be carried out in close connection with this most fundamental issue , that is , safeguarding the economic interests and democratic rights of workers and staff members and fulfilling their spiritual and cultural needs .  
This is set to have an important , profound , and far-reaching impact on ensuring the delivery of national defense education to the whole people , propelling national defense construction in the new era , reinforcing the whole people 's national defense awareness and national cohesion , raising the quality of the whole people , and even promoting the construction of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Huang Ju told the pacesetters : You have embodied the spiritual style of Chinese servicemen in the new era .  Your spirit of studying and working hard at your posts and serving the motherland will particularly play a great encouraging and exemplary role for the broad ranks of Shanghai cadres and young comrades in further arousing their enthusiasm and creativity , and comprehensively pushing forward the socialist modernization program .  
upheld the principle of uniting , educating , and redeeming the majority ; engaged ourselves in the arduous , patient , and painstaking work of straightening out the thinking of " Falungong " practitioners ; and have successfully helped thousands upon thousands of " Falungong " practitioners see the error of their ways , make a clean break with the crooked ideas and fallacies of the " Falungong , " extricate themselves from Li Hongzhi 's spiritual control , and return to the normal track of their work and life .  
These words - - which have won universal praise - - and the noble spirit conveyed in them have greatly touched the hearts of a large number of people , and have influenced generation after generation of the masses and Communist party members .  They have become a kind of treasured spiritual wealth of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese nation , and have also become enduring red classics .  
This sheer nonsense created by Li Hongzhi has belittled the remarkable achievements China has attained in its building of a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization at the present stage , and has fully exposed the anti-human essence of the " Falungong . "  
We should further improve the quality of all people 's knowledge of law and the level of institutionalized management in society and create an ever more favorable legal environment for the building of the material and spiritual civilizations .  To do so , it is necessary for us to continue to give in-depth publicity to and conduct extensive education in the legal system among the citizens .  
It is the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force inspiring people of different ethnic backgrounds in the whole region to fight bravely in unity .  It is a powerful ideological weapon enabling us to know and transform the world .  We must always uphold it without wavering .  
Role models of demobilized military cadres that won awards at this conference are representatives of the excellent demobilized military cadres working in every front line throughout the country .  Their advanced deeds and lofty ideology embody the new spiritual outlook of the majority of demobilized military cadres , being precious spiritual resources .  The entire military should satisfactorily study and vigorously disseminate their deeds and ideology .  
In response to a reporter 's question , the spokesman said : We have taken note that to implement their separatist line in an accelerated way , the Taiwan authorities have taken many steps to cut off the cultural and spiritual links between Taiwan and the mainland .  The Taiwan leader 's refusal to admit he is a Chinese and recognize the principle of one China and his deliberate attempt to evade the basic fact that the two sides of the strait belong to one country are the most representative of this .  
Last year , in the course of formulating Beijing Municipality 's tenth five-year plan for economic and social development , the draft was twice discussed at the standing committee of the municipal political consultation conference .  Members of the political consultation conference provided many useful and constructive opinions on the general framework of the tenth five-year plan , the strategy for the capital 's sustainable development , urban construction and management , and spiritual civilization development .  
But what Taiwan lacks is not this factor .  Taiwan 's multi-party system and the very lacking and fantastically complex political-economic system including the spiritual state of her social , economic , political fronts , are the results of a relatively developed economy rather than relative backsliding .  
Marxism is our guiding ideology on building our party and state , the guide to actions in all our work , the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force pushing people of all nationalities of the entire country to fight for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through concerted efforts , and also a powerful ideological weapon for our efforts to understand the world and to reform the objective world and subjective world .  
This important thinking came from practice and guide practice .  Once this important thinking is combined with practice , it will become a powerful spiritual and material strength and will greatly advance construction of party-building and comprehensive military construction .  
Patriotism is a banner for mobilizing and motivating the billion Chinese people to struggle in unison , an enormous force for driving society and history forward , and a common spiritual pillar for people of all nationalities .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to implement the strategic policy for the new period and to closely center on the requirements of military struggle , working to provide sustained , adequate spiritual motive force for " being able to win " .  
The guiding principle for Tibet 's work in the new period has further aroused our consciousness in opposing separatism and safeguarding stability .  In exposing and criticizing Dalai in recent years , we have been waging a tit-for-tat struggle against him in the spiritual sphere , which is the main battleground , to fight confusion and correct foolishness .  We have done a great deal of highly effective work in strengthening the buildup of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Scientific and technical workers are part of China 's working class , they carry out courageous exploration and make constant progress , so they are the main inheritors and disseminators of scientific and cultural knowledge of humankind and play an irreplaceable role in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization . 
Without enhancing the level of productive forces , it is impossible to consolidate the political power , maintain social stability , improve the living standards of the people , and develop the spiritual civilization and the democratic and legal system .  
Large numbers of publishing workers have persisted in serving the people , socialism , and the overall situation in the work of the party and state ; they have made remarkable achievements in publicizing Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , in disseminating and accumulating scientific and cultural knowledge , in satisfying the spiritual and cultural needs of the people , and in promoting the building of the material and spiritual civilizations ; and they have played an important role in reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
New interpersonal relationships and healthy , scientific and civilized way of life are taking shape .  The strengthening of our ideological and moral building has become our powerful political advantage that enables our party to lead the people to overcome various kinds of difficulties and dangers .  It has become an important spiritual force that enables us to seize the opportunities , speed up development and promote all-round progress of the society .  
The party has persisted in unfolding the main themes , advocating diversified development of our cultural undertakings , and vigorously developing our literature and art , press and publication , and radio and television undertakings to constantly satisfy our people 's increasing spiritual and cultural demands .  Cultural life of our urban and rural people is rich and colorful .  
We should persist in sticking to the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , vigorously bring about our prosperous socialist culture and make efforts to provide our reform , opening up and modernization with a powerful spiritual motive power and ideological guarantee .  
second , it is even more difficult to do this because we are confronted with the new situation characterized by the new scientific and technological revolution in the 21st century and the fierce competition worldwide , with a serious challenge from our double mission to achieve China 's modernization , and with the magnificent task of building a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The two major theoretical results are the crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the party and the people , the valuable spiritual wealth of our party , and the great banner that guides us to advance triumphantly .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .  
We must insist on grasping two links simultaneously and being firm on both hands , intensify the construction of spiritual civilization , arm people with scientific theory , guide people with correct public opinion , mold people with lofty spirit , inspire people with excellent works , and provide powerful spiritual motivation with reform , opening up , and modernization .  
To practice the requirement of representing the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must enhance the building of socialist spiritual civilization , persistently educate the people with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , effectively implement the strategy of relying on science and education for national regeneration , promote the enhancement of the ideological and moral integrity and scientific and cultural attainments of the whole nation .  
We must base ourselves on the new practice of social life today and on the new development of the times , strengthen theoretical study , conscientiously sum up the experience , tackle problems in real earnest , make explorations in the midst of practice , make innovations in the midst of explorations , and move forward in the midst of innovations .  While doing a better job in the building of material civilization , we must keep pushing ahead with the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
To study the " speech , " we should hold high the advance banner of China 's advanced culture , strive to create and carry forward a new culture that embodies the requirements of revolution , construction , and reform , satisfy the growing needs of the masses of the people for spiritual culture , and push forward the development and progress of socialist society in a comprehensive way .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech delivered at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China points out the Party 's historical task and objective in the new century and provides a powerful ideological weapon and enormous spiritual driving force that encourages the majority of Party members to live through all kinds of tests and forever maintain the advanced nature of Party members .  
Second , we must throw ourselves into red-hot revolution and construct reality , research the actual major questions of the Party , the government and the masses , and provide an accurate direction for public opinion and support for spiritual intelligence for the great leap forward in Tibetan development and long-term political stability .  This is the glorious and important responsibility of workers in the social sciences .  
Watching the exhibits , Ding Guangen praised the success of the exhibition .  He expressed the hope that the entire society would devote more efforts to building spiritual civilization , give wide publicity to scientific theories , disseminate the advanced culture , cultivate an elevated mind , carry forward justice , popularize scientific knowledge , advocate the scientific spirit , eradicate the soil that engenders " Falungong " and all other decadent ideologies and cultures , and make it a social practice to oppose cults and promote civilization .  
The PLA , armed police , and law enforcement units stationed in Tibet are strong pillars and loyal guards who safeguard the motherland 's frontier areas and Tibet 's stability .  They are important forces for building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations in Tibet . They must continue to carry forward their fine traditions and work styles , ensure their own construction , strengthen their unity with the local governments , civilian authorities , and the people , and make new contributions to Tibet 's stability and development .  
These reporters visited almost all the companies and forward posts in the coastal and frontier areas of the country and sent out more than 400 news reports , zealously eulogizing frontier servicemen 's heroic achievements and mental outlook of fighting arduously and bravely making contributions .  Besides , these reports have vividly demonstrated the historically great changes in coastal and border defense and fully reflected the border areas ' new progress in army-government and army-people unity and material and spiritual civilizations .  
In the new historical conditions , society will be diversified and the situation will become more complex .  In light of this , only with a clear theoretical understanding can one take a firm political stance , take initiatives , and hold loftier spiritual ideals .  
To profoundly study and implement the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , the meeting decided to adopt several measures on the basis of study : first , the central group of the Central Discipline-Inspection Commission would set aside a period of time for carefully studying and discussing specific topics in Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , so as to achieve a profound understanding and accurate grasp of the spiritual essence .  
As a powerful ideological weapon and tremendous spiritual motivation for army building , the " three represents " constitute a reliable guarantee of the army 's always keeping a firm and correct political orientation .  
Proceeding from the profound changes in the domestic and international situation faced by our party and from major historical tasks shouldered by our party , the speech systematically and penetratingly expounded the scientific connotation and the spiritual essence of the important idea of " three represents . "  
Proceeding from the intense changes in the domestic and international situation facing the party , and from the major historic task shouldered by the party , he comprehensively and profoundly expounded the scientific meaning and spiritual essence of the important thinking of the " three represents . "  
As is known to all , the infamous Yasukuni Shrine is a symbol of Japanese militarism and the spiritual pillar of Japan 's launching of the aggressive wars .  Flaunting the big banner of " national Shinto , " the shrine has been fooling people into believing the nonsense that the soul of the dead will return to Yasukuni Shrine , and had been driving the Japanese people to lay down their lives on the battlefields for Japan 's aggressive wars .  
We should play a vanguard role in the building of a spiritual civilization , guide the masses of all ethnic groups to emancipate their minds and renew their concepts , advocate science , and provide a strong spiritual motive power for economic growth in border areas .  We should play the role of a commando in the country 's large-scale development of its western region , firmly establish the thinking that we must develop and bring wealth to border areas while defending and consolidating them ;  
literature and art work should be concentrated on creating excellent works in larger quantity ; ideological and political work should be concentrated on enhancing understanding , unifying ideas , and improving its pertinence and practical results ; and the building of spiritual civilization should be concentrated on consolidation , enhancement , extension , and radiation and on spreading the experience gained at selected units to , and promote , the entire area .  
Second , the party 's basic theory , basic line , and basic program as well as numerous other principles and policies at the initial stage of socialism are extremely invaluable spiritual wealth attainted by the party after scientifically having summed up domestic and international historical experience , positive and negative .  
Our thorough study , correct understanding , and proper implementation of the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech in the new century is bound to turn the spiritual strength of the Speech into tremendous material strength and spur our party and state undertakings to advance from victory to victory .  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
Officials were of the view that on-line information should be able to satisfy the needs of the people 's just and healthy spiritual life , allow the world to understand China fully , accurately , and in a timely way , and resist the ideological and cultural infiltration of harmful information and its pernicious social influence .  
The grand military review for celebrating the 50th founding anniversary of New China demonstrated to the whole world our army 's fine spiritual outlook and tremendous achievements in modernization .  This military review also greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm and the national pride of the people throughout the country .

The grand military review for celebrating the 50th founding anniversary of New China demonstrated to the whole world our army 's fine spiritual outlook and tremendous achievements in modernization .  This military review also greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm and the national pride of the people throughout the country .  
Third , in the face of the mutual impacts of the various different ideologies and cultures in the world , it is not enough for us to depend only on the method of controlling the information flow ; and we must also improve the quality of socialist cultural products and give shape to a common ideal and a spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation in the whole society .  
Since we have consistently attached importance to and persistently grasped ideological and political work as the central link , the central policy decision has deeply penetrated into people 's minds , and this has effectively eliminated interference in ideological understanding , mobilized the activism and initiative of all sectors , formed a powerful spiritual motive force for impelling the work , and ensured the smooth implementation of the central policy decision .  
In his speech , Jiang Chunyun said : As mass organizations that assist the government in mobilizing people to practice family planning , family planning associations at all levels have , over the past 20 years , effectively carried out work around the basic national policy of family planning under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels .  They have played an increasingly prominent role in grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , poverty relief , community development , spiritual civilization , and international exchanges and cooperation .  
Family planning associations at the grass-roots level should take an active part in exercising democratic management and supervision over family planning and making family planning matters in the villages known to the public , and advance grass-roots democracy , legal institutions , and spiritual civilization , so as to promote social and economic development and political stability .  
We should build an advanced culture to meet the people 's growing needs in cultural life and provide the productive forces development with a spiritual motive force as well as intellectual support .  
During his inspection , Li Tieying also listened to reports on Chongqing 's ideas and work on participating in the extensive development of the western region .  In addition , he inspected private enterprises and demonstration areas for national spiritual civilization building , as well as demonstration streets for the national activities against counterfeit goods , the civilization community , and experimental primary schools .  
Fourth , colleges , universities , scientific and technological research institutes , and hi-tech enterprises in the vicinity of the S &amp; T park should also make contributions to local development , converting scientific and technological achievements , fostering professional personnel , promoting education , paying taxes according to law , building a civilized community , and promoting socialist spiritual civilization .  
Li Lanqing said at the end : To popularize scientific knowledge across the whole society , to establish scientific thinking , to promote scientific spirit , and to publicize scientific methods suit the need for implementing the strategy of developing China through science and education , for upgrading the masses ' qualities , and for facilitating a healthy development in our socialist material and spiritual civilization construction .  The tasks also suit the need for eliminating the poison inflicted by ignorance , superstition , various pseudosciences , and antisciences ; for safeguarding social stability ;  
Second , it expresses their discontent of the West for ignoring Asian ideological traditions all these years .  What is more , it also reflects a kind of anxiety shown by people under the challenge of global economic globalization .  In the present-day world when economic activities become more " interdependent , " it is necessary to consider establishing some moral consensus on the spiritual and cultural levels .  
since our party represents the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , it must persistently take Marxism as the guide , inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , study and absorb all the fruits of human civilization , and continually build and create socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , so that material and spiritual civilization will develop in coordinated fashion and promote the all-round progress of society ;  
Since people 's spiritual and cultural demands are restricted by historical , social , or personal factors on the one hand , and is plastic in nature on the other .  Therefore , guiding people 's spiritual and cultural life is both necessary and indispensable .  
under the guidance of Marxism , to constantly build and develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics that is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future so as to bring about coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and promote comprehensive social progress ;  
Thirdly , the ultimate goal of our efforts to liberate and develop our productive forces and to build a socialist spiritual civilization is to satisfy the people 's growing material demands in their everyday life , that is , to better represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses and serve them wholeheartedly .  
In the final analysis , all struggles carried out by our party were aimed at liberating and developing productive forces ; and all guiding principles and policies adopted by our party are aimed at eventually ensuring continuous development of productive forces , boosting national economic development , raising the overall national strength , building socialist material and spiritual civilizations , satisfying the people 's increasing material and cultural needs , and becoming more representative of the people 's fundamental interests .  
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
We must understand , think over , and resolve , in accordance with the intrinsic relations among society , economics , politics , and culture , the question of how our party can better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture , always uphold Marxism as the guide , and strive to understand and master the characteristics and laws of cultural construction so as to continuously create and push ahead the culture with Chinese characteristics , develop socialist materialist and spiritual civilizations in a coordinated way , and achieve overall social progress .  
In the historical process of the new emerging out of the old , mankind 's advanced culture consciously represents the mainstream of the times , the orientation of social development , and the will of the people and is an active and dynamic spiritual force for guiding and promoting historical progress .  
The leadership collective of the third generation of the party with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has all the more attached importance to and strengthened the building of socialist spiritual civilization , made continuous new advances in this aspect while persisting in taking economic construction as the center and paying close attention to the building of material civilization , and clearly and definitely set and gradually and systematically expounded the task of building a culture with Chinese characteristics .  
However , we should fully understand the importance , protracted nature , and arduousness of intensifying the building of spiritual civilization , firmly foster the political awareness and the awareness on general interest , responsibility , ideological front , and innovation , and further increase the sense of mission , urgency , and the age , so as to carry out the building of spiritual civilization in a still more vivid , enlivened , and solid way .  
Ding Guangen stressed in his speech that to intensify the building of spiritual civilization , we must seriously study and put into effect the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , persist in taking Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide to study how to answer the major strategic questions that have a bearing on the overall situation of developing the party and state 's cause and the major ideological and theoretical questions that are posed in real life and followed by cadres and masses with interest ; 
The key to building spiritual civilization lies in always grasping the work with perseverance and having it effectively carried out .  Specifically speaking , it should be carried out for the all-round elevation of the people 's quality among all social organizations at the grassroots level .  
persist in taking Marxism as a guide , proceed from the reality of the initial stage of socialism , emancipate the mind , seek truth from facts , conduct bold innovation , and correctly handle the relations between communities and residents , other units stationed in the communities , and pertinent government administrative organs ; penetratingly explore the organizational forms and structure of communities which are suited to the requirements of the building of spiritual civilization , and positively bring forth new ideas on the community management system and activity modes that are well received by the people .  
Hu Kangsheng said : To amend the Marriage Law , we should proceed from China 's actual conditions , uphold the socialist marriage and family system , adhere to practicing the marriage system in terms of freedom of marriage , monogamy , and equality of men and women , maintain the equal , harmonious , and civilized matrimonial family relationship , safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women , children , and the aged , and give an impetus to the building of socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  
The promulgation and implementation of this law have played a positive role in establishing and safeguarding the equal , harmonious , and civilized matrimonial family relationship , promoting the building of the socialist spiritual civilization and social progress , and maintaining social stability .  
It is necessary to thoroughly understand the new and higher demands set by the " three represents " on the building the armed forces ideologically and politically .  It is necessary to further emancipate the mind , update concepts , courageously blaze new trails , and strive to make ideological and political work more lively , solid and effective in light of the new situation and tasks in order to provide a powerful spiritual motive force and a reliable political guarantee for " winning victories " and " preventing degeneration . "  
To achieve practical results in ideological and political work , it is necessary to closely combine it with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , and concentrate efforts on masking an issue of " new development " ; we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , ways , means , and mechanisms , and continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
By grasping the four " new " things , upholding the four " close connections , " and carrying out work in a creative way , ideological and political work will be closer to the era , the masses , and daily life , will be effectively intensified and improved , and will also be able to give fuller play to its role as spiritual motive force and political guarantee .  
All localities and all military units should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central ideological and political work conference .  They should launch the activities of building spiritual civilization through the joint efforts of servicemen and civilians and promote coordinated development of spiritual and material civilization .  
Fourth , in close connection with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , methods , means , and mechanisms to continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
The circular points out : Since the establishment of the national class-A soccer tournament system in 1994 , China has accelerated the socialization and industrialization of soccer matches .  The number of persons who have cared for and watched the soccer matches has unceasingly increased .  Soccer matches has become the component of the cultural life of the broad masses of people and the window of building socialist spiritual civilization in the urban areas .  
All publicity and ideological bases and spiritual and cultural products must be favorable to publicizing scientific theory , disseminating advanced education , and shaping good minds .  We must not provide the channels of dissemination for wrong things .  
Labor models and advanced workers are the outstanding representatives of China 's working class and millions upon millions of the laboring masses .  They are the vanguards of the building of material and spiritual civilization .  Their advanced thinking and exemplary deeds fully manifest the lofty style and spirit of China 's working class .  
On the other hand , in recent years , some local public security organs have concentrated on the building of a material civilization to the neglect of the building of a spiritual civilization and have overlooked and slackened their efforts in promoting their ideological and political work .  
The forum seriously studied and implemented the spirit of the important speech delivered by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the Central Ideological and Political Work Conference , discussed how to enhance the convincing and combat effectiveness of theoretical work , how to make ideological and political work more specific and effective , and how to make propaganda , ideological work , and spiritual civilization better serve the development of the west region .  
All the propaganda , ideological , and cultural front and all spiritual and cultural products should publicize scientific theory , spread advanced culture , portray a fine spirit , and encourage healthy social tendencies .  
The constant improvement in the quality of science , technology and culture of cadres at all levels and the people of all ethnic groups , and the constant increase in the sense of democracy and the legal system and the expansion of the spiritual civilization will create a favorable investment and development environment for developing the western region .  The improvement in such environment itself is a kind of important fundamental construction , which is just as important as the construction of infrastructure and other hardware .  
After leaving the hall , Buddhist Master Shenghui , member of the Chinese religious and spiritual leaders delegation and vice president of the Buddhist Association of China , told Chinese and foreign reporters : " It was unwise for the Dalai Lama to dispatch a representative to read his letter to the Millennium World Peace Summit , though he was clever not to attend the summit .  As a result , the move has disrupted the normal process of the summit , which is not in harmony with the general atmosphere of the meeting . "  
Ding Guangen said : Building civilized communities is urgently needed for enhancing the ideological and political work and building a spiritual civilization , for gearing up our urban construction and management , for improving the living environment of residents and safeguarding social and political stability , and for building close party-mass ties and consolidating the foundation of our party as a ruling party .  
We resolutely oppose bureaucracy and formalism .  We should persist in raising the quality of residents and the level of civilization in communities as our main objective , strive to build modern urban communities marked by fine environments , good order , quality service , and successful management .  We should also form a moral standard in communities that respects the advanced , helps each other in the spirit of solidarity , upholds the good , suppresses the bad , and aggressively makes progress so as to achieve coordinate development in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
His advanced deeds and noble spirit fully embody the lofty realm of communists and revolutionary soldiers in consciously practicing " three represents , " and demonstrates the spiritual outlook of teachers of military academies who heroically blaze new trails , are content in serving as the ladder for others to get ahead , and work with selflessly devotion .  
In line with Chairman Jiang 's important instructions , the all-military political work meeting has put forward the historical missions of ideological and political construction in the military in the new situation - - to provide powerful spiritual motivation for winning future high-tech wars , and to provide a reliable political guarantee for maintaining the nature , inherent qualities , and style of the people 's military .  
This responsible person noted that ever since the true features the " Falungong " as a religious cult were revealed , over 98 percent of the " Falungong " practitioners have seen the error of their ways and are determined to make a clean break with their past .

While intensifying economic legislation , we should have a good grasp of the legislative work in terms of education , science and technology , culture , and so on with a view to creating a favorable legal environment and providing complete legal protection for developing China 's advanced culture , promoting the building of socialist spiritual civilization , and carrying out the strategy of rejuvenating the country on the strength of science and culture .

While concentrating our energies on achieving agricultural and rural economic development , we must really have a good grasp of the building of rural grassroots organizations , democratic legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization , maintain social stability in the rural areas , and give impetus to the rural economic and social development in a comprehensive way .  
Only by so doing , can they better implement their sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .

Deng Xiaoping Theory has provided the powerful ideological weapon for our party to understand the world and remold the world , and it is also the spiritual dynamic to gather and inspire the entire party and people of the whole country to attain the common ideal and promote overall social progress .  
We should give full consideration to the characteristics of the ideological work , which should be adapted to the requirements of the socialist market economic system and which should be conducive to strengthening party leadership , to giving full play to the initiative of propaganda and cultural workers , and to promoting the development and prosperity of various undertakings .  We should publish more works of excellence to satisfy the increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .

The party and government have always paid great attention to Chinese peasants ' health standards .  They have initiated and extensively launched " bodybuilding activities for hundreds of millions of peasants , " and guided the broad masses of peasants to carry out physical exercise in an effort to attain healthy and strong physiques , upgrade their working and living conditions , and enhance their spiritual civilization construction .  The " PRC Sports Law " has incorporated athletic activities in rural areas under the legal system .  
The Law on the National Common Language adopted at this meeting will provide a correct guide for the normalization , standardization , and healthy growth of our national common spoken and written languages ; and it is therefore conducive to the country 's reunification and national unity , and to our building of socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  The passing of the revised Law on Fisheries is of great significance to stepping up our protection , multiplication , development , and rational utilization of fishery resources ;  
We should persistently rectify and eliminate chaos and ignorance .  We should establish constructive models while eliminating negative ones in accordance with the policy of promoting positive examples while discarding bad elements .  We should correctly handle the ties between the inheritance and creation of nationalities ' traditional culture , increase cultural exchanges among fraternal nationalities , absorb the accomplishments of all the civilizations of mankind , and upgrade the educational level of Tibet 's various nationalities so as to provide powerful spiritual driving force and intellectual support for developing Tibet into a new socialist region .

We must seize historical opportunities , accelerate reform and development of the journalistic cause , increase strength and vitality , win over the masses , and occupy the market .  We must make General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's " Three Represents " as a major ideological guide , earnestly promote the building of the ranks of journalist workers , so that our journalistic workers will become honest recorders of the progress of the times and become active builders of material and spiritual civilizations .

Today , all we 're doing , such as conducting economic construction , building spiritual civilization , building democracy , and building a legal system , are in the final analysis aimed at ensuring that the 1.2 billion Chinese people will live and work in peace and contentment and will fully enjoy all types of human rights and basic freedoms .  
4 ) Publicizing patriotism and socialist spiritual civilization : The wealth of themes vividly expressed on the colorful commemorative gold and silver coins , together with the appreciation of thousands upon thousands of collectors , makes it possible for patriotism and the aim of socialist spiritual civilization building to merge imperceptibly into the masses ' spiritual and cultural lives . 
Looking back at the arduous path , the road of development , Shanghai has taken in the 1980 ' s and 1990 ' s , a thousand thoughts rush through the mind of Huang Ju , CPC Politburo member and Shanghai Municipal Party Committee secretary .  He said , " One very important thing is that we have always insisted on being innovative , tenacious , and functional , " and " that mind frame and work method have been the precious spiritual wealth that guided Shanghai toward the new century . "  
These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
We must stick to the principle that both material progress and spiritual progress should be promoted in real earnest , with neither aspect being neglected .  We must earnestly step up spiritual civilization building and democratic legal system building , vigorously develop the advanced culture , and provide the campaign to " build first-rate city " with a powerful spiritual driving force , intellectual support , and legal guarantee .  
The building of spiritual social regions , civilized townships , and cultural industries were focused on , mass spiritual civilization construction activities were expanded in-depth , and all types of work were advanced overall .  All of this played an active role in promoting reform and development , and in protecting social stability .  
We must uphold economic development as the center , and integrate spiritual civilization construction work with city and rural development work , as well as with business work for all industries and trades .  We must put efforts into raising the ideological and moral quality of people , and also their science and cultural quality , thus providing spiritual motivation and ideological assurance for modernization construction .  
During the July-September period , public security organs across the country , with close coordination of other departments , launched a campaign to tighten the management of places of entertainment and service .  They carried out a severe crackdown on prostitution , gambling , drug trafficking , and other social evils .  They also tightened the management of places where electronic games were available .  They have made contributions to improving the social environment and promoting a socialist spiritual civilization .  
From their practice of changing Jilin'sbackward look , the city party committee and the city government of Jilin have learned that to bring the spiritual civilization building into factories , mines , and communities in real terms , what counts is to introduce a new practice of activating the ideological-political work from bottom to top instead of the other way round , and to move the foothold of the work from the previous practice of holding oneself responsible for higher authorities to a new practice of holding oneself responsible for lower levels .  
It must also help bring into play the initiative and creativeness of broadcast workers , help combine social benefits and economic benefits , help promote the sound and prosperous development of the broadcasting industry , and better meet the growing spiritual and cultural needs of the masses of the people .  
I hope that you would treasure your duty and mission , cultivate a strong enterprising spirit and sense of responsibility , and devote your thoughts and energies to the successful running of the broadcasting industry .  You should learn , learn and learn again , penetrate , penetrate and penetrate still deeper .  You should draw wisdom and nourishments from the fervent activities of reform and construction and from the practice of the masses in creating a beautiful future in order to improve your political quality , spiritual outlook and vocational level .  
The tourism areas and tourism service units should vigorously carry out healthy and beneficial tourism activities , exploit potential humanity values of sight-seeing spots for tourism , combine tourism development with efforts to enhance socialist spiritual civilization construction , advocate the national culture through the tourism window , enhance patriotism education , and promote international cultural exchanges .  
In this way we can form and develop a positive and upward-looking public opinion environment throughout society , enable scientific theory and correct ideology to play the dominant role in social life activities , enable the cadres and masses to maintain good spiritual features , and continually consolidate and develop the basis of the common ideal of the people of all nationalities throughout the country in their united endeavors .  
it must make efforts to combine the theoretical nature of propaganda and education in ideals , beliefs , and ethical concepts with the practical nature of people 's daily life and work , and succeed in carrying out this work in a variety of forms , in a lively and vivid way that the masses enjoy and accept , which can answer problems of ideological understanding existing among the masses and continually play a tremendous role as a spiritual pillar in the masses ' work and endeavors .  
It is necessary to vigorously carry forward the lofty ideology and spirit of selfless dedication of the labor models , cultivate a worker rank with ideals , ethics , culture , and discipline , guide and stimulate the workers to actively plunge into the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and persistently influence and lead forward the whole of society with the advanced ideology of the working class .  
This is the first time that advanced productive forces and advanced culture , that is , material and spiritual civilization , have been scientifically and dialectically linked to the fundamental interests of the people , and that advanced nature and the fundamental interests of the people have been unified in the people 's historic practice .  
conscientiously uphold the principle of " attending to two types of work [ the building of a material civilization and a spiritual civilization ] simultaneously , attaching equal importance of both " ; effect temporary as well as permanent solutions to existing problems , and intensify their efforts in eliminating the root causes of these problems ; and further promote , in a deep-going manner , the government 's work of building an uncorrupted administration and fighting against corruption .  
In their speeches , they also put forward opinions and proposals on how to better maintain and improve the CPC-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation system , further deepen reforms , promote sustained economic development , safeguard the political situation of stability and unity , enhance socialist democracy and the building of the legal system , and advance the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the new year .  
In the incident , several people obsessed with " Falungong , " who were under the spiritual control of Li Hongzhi , attempted to burn themselves to death , turning a blind eye to both love in the world and love in their families and displaying not the least virtue or intuitive knowledge as human beings , and have thus destroyed themselves , their families , and their children as well .  
Charged with a heavy task , the women 's federations or their organizations at all levels should give full scope to the unique superiority of the broad masses of women and families in resisting an evil cult ; should help " Falungong " practitioners free themselves from the spiritual control of the evil cult ideologically , organizationally , and once and for all ; and should help them keep abreast with the pace of the times by enjoying to the full a warm or progressive life brought by science and civilization as well .  
What they are pursuing is no longer a simple " Cold-War mentality , " but an " imperial strategy " of seizing the sphere of influence , and their ideological basis is narrow ideology and ultra-nationalism .  And , with the two highly destructive " poisonous spiritual arrows " directly aimed at China , a marvelous strategic sight has taken shape , in which all the major forces with great interests in the region point their strategic focus at China .  
Everyone pointed out that the people 's army is the loyal protector of the people 's interests , that we must take the lead to implement and propagate the spiritual civilization of socialism , to study , discuss and practice science , to spread advanced civilization , to criticize the superstitions of evil religion , and to further tackle every task in order to provide a dependable assurances of security in realizing the magnificent goals planned by the 15th National People 's Congress .  
The political system may vary from one country to another , but all countries in the world share the same task of cracking down on evil cults and drug trafficking .  He called on all nations in the world to make joint efforts to thoroughly eliminate evil cults and drugs by casting aside their political differences and join hands in building a healthier and better living environment for all human being and creating a clean world without drugs , without pollution , without evil cults , and without spiritual opium for future generations .  
He said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , the sports front persisted in carrying out the party 's principles and policies in the physical culture work , persistently took the improvement of the people 's physique as its principal task , and adhered to the principle of combining popularization with enhancement and promoting the coordinated development of mass sports and athletic competition , so that it has scored tremendous achievements and made significant contributions to the building of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  
Through vigorously popularizing scientific , healthy , and civilized modes of fitness among the broad masses , we should enable the physical culture work to play its unique role in uniting the broad masses , maintaining social stability , and promoting the building of both material and spiritual civilizations .  
Li Peng fully affirmed Guangdong 's major achievements in building material and spiritual civilization .  During the inspection tour , Li Peng had an informal discussion with relevant responsible comrades from the provincial people 's congress to solicit their opinions and suggestions on the NPC Standing Committee 's work report .  He also toured enterprises and neighborhoods to gain first-hand information on enterprise reform and urban construction , and to extend cordial greetings to manufacturing and office workers on the frontlines of production and management .  
and so on .  People who are paranoid are deprived of the normal ability to judge correctly and tend to blindly follow a common belief of a group .  Some people obsessed with or under the spiritual control of Li Hongzhi 's " Scriptures " have cultivated a firm belief in Li Hongzhi 's fallacy of " elevation to Heaven " and have tended to go after a blind move made by a group like a flock of ducks .  
This bloody self-immolation further proved that " Falungong " is an out-and-out cult bearing all the characteristics of cults in the world , such as demanding absolute loyalty to the cult chief , fabricating antiscientific fallacies , exercising spiritual control over their followers , having mysterious and strict organization , being strongly exclusive and antisocial , irregularly spreading the " theory of world 's doomsday , " and creating the tragedy of " rise to heaven for full accomplishment . "  
The experts pointed out : For some time , the " Falungong " cult has created the worship of its founder , exercised spiritual control , concocted heresies , formed secret associations , accumulated wealth by unfair or illegal means , inflicted mortal injuries on human lives , and trampled on human rights .  These are acts in serious violation of the relevant Chinese laws .  
As a cultural system , each religion has drawn on the numerous spiritual assets created in the history of human civilization to become an important part of traditional culture and a way of life for its believers .  Religion has become a stabilizing force in society , playing a unique role in coordinating or balancing various spheres of activity in society .  
Since the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , tremendous achievements that attracted worldwide attention have been scored in China in reform , opening up , and the drive for modernization , the building of democratic legal system and spiritual civilization have been distinctly intensified , the citizens ' awareness in democratic legal system and quality of ideology and morality have been constantly elevated , and gratifying changes have taken place in social ethics and habits .  
Along with the development of the socialist market economy , the law governing the exchange of commodities will easily produce corrosive influences in social political life and people 's spiritual realm , give rise to the disregard of moral principles in pursuit of profits and the exchange of power for money , and lead to the weakening of the state and collective awareness and the spirit of mutual assistance and dedication .  
In our struggle against the " Falungong " cult , we conscientiously implemented the spirit of a series of instructions from the party center , gave full play to the advantage of ideological and political work , and offered all-dimensional help and education .  We managed to transform an overwhelming majority of those who practiced " Falungong " and , in particular , helped 43 fanatic followers of " Falungong " free themselves from their spiritual shackles .  
Some awakened " Falungong " followers expressed their belief that " now that we are rid of Li Hongzhi 's spiritual yoke , we feel very relaxed , and feel that life is so beautiful , leaders at every level are so amiable and respectful , the Party and the government are so great and right . "  
Li Lanqing said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , as China 's building of socialist spiritual civilization was further strengthened , the literary and artistic undertaking was flourishing in all fields , and the good athletes obtained excellent achievements in some major international games .  
Li Lanqing called for the governments at all levels to highly value the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking , regard it as a major component of the building of socialist spiritual civilization , increase the intensity of financial input , and give correct guidance to further advance the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking .  
Under the conditions of a socialist market economy , carrying forward and developing the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation , giving rise to a sound common practice of respecting , providing for , assisting the elderly in society , and building up a harmonious relationship between different generations is a major content for our current socialist spiritual civilization building .  
It is important to bring into play the roles of the elderly ; and according to the principle of integrating voluntary participation with one 's actual ability and integrating the demands of the society with one 's personal interests , the elderly should be encouraged to participate in activities of educating the younger generation , passing on scientific and cultural knowledge , providing consulting services , and taking part in social welfare undertakings and in the spiritual civilization building of their communities .  
They should seriously implement the important " three represents " thinking , devote more efforts to political construction , and unswervingly arm their minds with Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the series of important theses by President Jiang so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation , consolidate the spiritual pillar , and build a strong mental defense line .  
and great achievements have been made in the construction of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization .  This is a result of the efforts that Sichuan and Yunnan provincial party committees and provincial governments have made in leading the broad ranks of cadres and masses all over the two provinces to work hard , but live plainly , and forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit .  
Promoting comprehensive economic and social development , properly building the material and spiritual civilizations , making efforts to promote the coordinated development of the urban and rural areas and of different regions , keeping economic development , population , resources , and the environment in line , and bringing about sustainable economic and social development are the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , are important expression of our party 's " three represents " thinking , and are also the direction for the process of socialist modernization which we must firmly grasp .  
We must persistently take economic construction as the center , build a high degree of material and spiritual civilizations , speed up the comprehensive progress of various social undertakings , and strive to satisfy the people 's increasing material and cultural needs .  
29 .  In chapter 20 of " enhancing ideological and ethical education and of building a common ideological and spiritual support , " " particularly enhance ideological , political , ethical quality , and legal system education among youngsters " was revised to " particularly enhance ideological , political , ethical quality , psychological health , and legal system education among youngsters . "  
We will not merely stay at the growth of per capita income but , more importantly , make efforts in numerous areas including the consumption structure , living environment , social security , public services , medical treatment and healthcare , spiritual demands , and so on so that the material , spiritual , and cultural demands of the vast number of people are satisfied as much as possible , and their quality in life is improved .  
Second , it is necessary to link such activities with the promotion of spiritual civilization in rural areas , to heighten in an all-round way the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the masses of cadres and people in rural areas , and to provide economic and social development in rural areas with an ideological guarantee , spiritual motive force , and intellectual support .  
Mixing skylines from both cities form an imaginary chart .  The " City Cookie " goes one step further to allow people to have a bite of this crispy sky , and the " Sky-Eaters " will then experience how to make the impossible possible .  For Ho Siu-kee , the locus of cultural and spiritual identity is situated within one 's own bodies .  At the site of the body , knowledge of the world may be tested and even elaborated into myths .  
" It is no longer true that all Hong Kong people are too wrapped up in making money to pay heed and appreciate their heritage .  Perhaps a majority of them still does but a significant minority is demanding spiritual sustenance from Hong Kong 's rich heritage , be it archeological relics , historical buildings , traditional and cultural practices and all manners of antiquities .  
Apart from foreign debts , many communist ideologues find other reasons to oppose the current liberal policies . Some deplore the presence of " spiritual pollution " , seeing a growing materialism among mainland Chinese . Others view foreign investment as pure and simple exploitation of cheap labor , with the special treatment afforded to foreign firms and their workers inimical to the spirit of equality that communism was supposed to bring .  
What we are concerned about today is how , during the process of our society 's transformation and while our citizens pursue their economic lives , we can uphold our traditional ethical , spiritual , and moral concepts and fuse this into a harmonious and modern industrial society .  
Architects and scholars generally agree that traditional architecture had three special characteristics . First , from a structural perspective , the brackets piled layer by layer to support the eaves and the graceful sweep of the roof created a sense of fullness and lightness . Second , the strict attention paid to etiquette and the comprehensive ethical system of traditional society engendered a respect for balance and uprightness . Third , from a spiritual standpoint , the ancient Chinese cosmic order of yin and yang helped produce a feeling for the use of space .  
Master Sheng-yen has two explanations for the turnabout . First , at a time when contemporary man 's living space grows ever smaller and social tensions ever greater , Buddhism offers people explanations for the flux around them and a limitless spiritual space to roam in . And second , as people rise in educational level , they gain a new understanding of Buddhism which they find more acceptable .  
Along with the growth in Taiwan 's economy , a rise in the general level of culture , and an increase in international contacts , many local Chinese have come to appreciate the charm of Chinese-style furniture from foreign friends , while others , having enjoyed all the products of Western civilization , have simply stopped to ask themselves : When even our last spiritual stronghold - - the home - - has become completely Westernized , is there anything left that 's special about being Chinese ?  
Without the benefit of modern architectural planning or impressive stylish theories , one or several anonymous Chinese craftsmen centuries ago fashioned the vital lines , the public spaces , and the spiritual corners of this beautiful little village .  
This has received attention because : ( a ) The proportion of the elderly in the population has increased ; they hope to continue to study and fill out their lives . ( b ) People demand satisfaction in their spiritual lives as the standard of living rises . ( c ) Constant technological change requires opportunities for continuing education .  
The painstaking process of raising them , in which expense is no object , would be inconceivable in ordinary hog raising , which is aimed at economic efficiency , but religious or spiritual values can never be measured in terms of economic efficiency .  
The attention of our people will gradually shift from the enjoyment of things and material well-being to the more refined and spiritual side of life , and people will stress quality rather than quantity . More emphasis will be put on enjoying life , on sampling quality products , on moving into the more rarefied atmosphere of high-class and well-designed living quarters , at the same time reaching into the top echelons of fashion - - all within the ethos of traditional Chinese culture .  
The prince grew up in a royal court surrounded by wealth , pleasure and power . But under his father 's close protection he discovered that no matter how wealthy or powerful a man may be , he can not escape suffering old age and death . He then decided to abandon his wife , family and princely status , and cultivate the spiritual path .  
As a result , starting with cinnabar elixirs and mystical techniques designed to ensure immortality , Taoism in due course assimilated the spiritual exercises of Zen Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism . As it transformed itself into a widespread popular belief it thus became an integral part of the lives of the common folk . (  
At the same time , the government should also thoroughly implement ecological protection and prevention of public hazards , while improving traffic , public safety , and living environment conditions . In this way the people will not only have access to plentiful resources for their everyday life , but will also enjoy a rich and meaningful spiritual life , thus thoroughly realizing the ideals of prosperity and equitable distribution of wealth as prescribed in our Principle of the People 's Well-Being .  
Confucian propriety constrained people 's unfettered nature and maintained harmonious social relations ; Taoism 's unworldliness let people free themselves from material temptations , emphasized the aesthetic side of life , and allowed people to find spiritual satisfaction beyond material things through the contemplation of nature .  
Modern Taiwan 's rural hinterland could hardly be expected to provide ethical regeneration and social harmony as it used to in the past , because concentration of the population in cities is already an established trend . But rural culture 's essential spiritual values can provide the basis for cultural development .  
Our middle class is constantly expanding , and these people have an excellent educational level and potential as opinion-formers . Once they become aware of the importance of regenerating spiritual values in our civilization , I believe balanced social development will be within our grasp .  
After all , perhaps , lay people 's belief in Buddhism and Buddhist worship may stem from a worldly viewpoint of bringing them tangible success . They seek support from the bodhisattvas ' spiritual power to guard them against evil , but they fail to cultivate inner awareness or attain the inner tranquility and joy that come from dispelling selfish attachments and external concerns about fortune or misfortune . In contrast to Manjusri with his metaphysical ideas of prajna wisdom , Samantabhadra and his message of " great action " exemplifies a much more concrete aspect of Buddhism .  
Originating as country farmhouses alongside tire hot springs , rustic chicken restaurants may look spartan but they offer spiritual re lease for the permanent city dweller , added to which their " free-range chicken " signs seem to offer the tempting opportunity to enjoy a rare pleasure at little cost .  
Today , agricultural villages are in a period of transition . The elderly are not accustomed to living with their children in the crowded cities , and they 're unwilling to live in old folk 's homes . If old trees and the environments around them can be preserved , the villages can remain semi-agricultural , the elderly will have places to go , and their spiritual needs will be taken care of , too .  
As far back as the time of the prehistoric matriarchal society , the primitive people living in the Yellow River valley had begun to keep dogs . Dogs were the first domestic animals to be reared by humans , and were not only intimately involved in people 's daily lives on a prac tical level , but were also an indispensable part of life on the spiritual plane .  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
Perhaps a philosophy of life and death can be free from objectivity , formality , and rigidity , but it has the opposite critical problem of becoming personalized , and freely verified only in one 's own mind , so it is impossible to come to a common spiritual consensus .  
Yet except for the moslems of Arabia who found a spiritual meaning in their abnormal state and treated them as spiritually blessed , most societies have traditionally viewed them as the cursed , bodies deserted by their spirits , violators of sacred laws , or people possessed by the devil - - even incarnations of the devil himself . They have faced brutal punishments , such as death by burning .  
After he returned to Japan , Ho 's worsening stomach ailment forced him to undergo surgery . The healing process was torturous , and to make matters worse , the Second World War had broken out . Under the pall of such physical and spiritual pain , the painter put down his brush . His brush had stopped , but he remained alive at heart .  
Again , Xue Baocha should have made an ideal wife for the son of a family of high standing , but because she is unable to communicate with Jia Baoyu on a spiritual level , although she gains social rank , she finds no sympathetic resonance , but instead only a cold , empty shell .  
Sogyal Rinpoche is the spiritual heir of an ancient lineage of teachers reaching back several centuries . But he has lived for many years amidst modern society , which is rich in material assets , but whose people are confused and perplexed . In his eyes , most people misuse life and misunderstand death : " Death in fact is a great opportunity . Only when we understand death can we know how to live . "  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
Wang Chen-tai notes that early on there were factional conflicts , reducing the religion 's impact . Fortunately , he says , learned elders like Hsieh Sung-tao and Ting Chung-ming wrote inexhaustibly . Also , because of the importance of diplomatic ties with Islamic countries , the ROC government has strongly supported Muslims . The Taipei mosque , which has been the main spiritual and practical resource for Muslims in Taiwan for many years now , was built with government money in response to strong and far-sighted efforts by Ambassador Yeh Kung-chao .  
Another judge , Huang Hai-ming , adds that the five artists selected reveal three cultural phenomena : the prospering global economy and information explosion that brought with them the crises of spiritual fragmentation and loss of self-identity ( Wang Jun-jieh ) , political and social criticism that followed the lifting of martial law ( Wu Tien-chang and Yao Jui-chung ) , and finally " a return to the feelings of the heart and the oriental tradition " ( Lee Ming-tse and Chen Chien-pei ) .  
The reason dZi beads have been connected to living Buddhas in Taiwan is that many believers take them to Buddhist masters to be " invested with spiritual power . " When Namgyal must tell people that what they supposed was a valuable old dZi bead is just a well-crafted reproduction , even he cushions the blow by saying that they can always ask a master to invest it with spiritual power so that it will become just as effective as a true old dZi bead .  
Extrapolating further , Ma says that overemphasis on knowledge and science means people lack the appropriate mental tools to help them understand their inner life . Thus , as material culture becomes more and more advanced and knowledge becomes more and more objective , we become more and more deficient in spiritual cultivation , and our moral character is more and more debased .  
He continues : " Actually he was talking about things on the spiritual plane , but who 'd have thought that so soon afterwards Puli would be left in such an appalling state by an earthquake , as if it really was sunk . So we all joked that he has ' second sight . ' " " In fact he had been extremely despondent , and that 's why he was eager to turn from mere thinking and observation to action , by doing some concrete community work .  
You can find as succinct a description of Zhu Xi 's importance as any in the Taiwan middle-school textbook History of Chinese Culture , which notes that Zhu Xi spent a lifetime annotating the Confucian classics , and established his own academies to teach others . It declaims : " You could say that , prior to the ascendance of Western power , Zhu Xi had the greatest influence on East Asian civilization of any one individual . His spirit permeated the daily lives , outlooks , and spiritual inclinations of Chinese people . "  
Huang Min-nan , who formerly headed pop music planning at Rock Records , says : " Buddhist music now changes several times a year . " Not so long ago Chinese-style symphonic music , or chanting accompanied by a single instrument was popular , but at the moment it 's all about " spiritual " music and dance tunes .  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
With modern science taking steps toward the spiritual world , " Taiwan is naturally best situated to take a world-leading role in this work . " Lee Si-chen points out that both Taoism and Buddhism have unique views about the operations of the universe . Furthermore , the Chinese in Taiwan have inherited from their ancestors both the active practice of qigong ( the movement of internal energy ) and the reflective practice of meditation . Research into these has been extensive , to a degree unimaginable in the West .  
Happy , because in the past century Taiwan has not directly experienced a major war , its economy and society have advanced steadily , and our living environment has continuously improved . Today 's Taipei is like any international city-modern and convenient , with most everything one needs in terms of daytime activities , nightlife , and material and spiritual culture .  
" Modern people are most easily swayed by things that are framed conceptually , so intuitive spiritual methods have to be packaged in rational terms to make them more acceptable . The new mode of ' spiritual cultivation ' is something that satisfies the demands of modern urbanites , " avers Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University .  
A lot of people in my business have also attended these spiritual growth classes , hoping to break through their personal difficulties , have more harmonious personal relationships , and progress to a higher level at work , " says Chen Tsu-yin . Chen recently entered the insurance business , and this year , despite her great terror about meeting people , won the annual best individual achievement prize given by her company 's customer service department .  
5 . Pay attention to the theoretical system underlying a spiritual cultivation method : As well as the theory itself , also observe whether this theoretical system links in with secular systems of knowledge . Excessive rejection of other ideas is usually a sign that something is amiss , but excessive tolerance or an attitude that anything goes is also too undiscerning .  
Ideally , this brief journey through the MWR should allow visitors to transcend the noise of ordinary existence and reflect on the meaning of life , and then return to aspects of concrete existence in the Avatamsaka World . It 's like a spiritual sauna . Or , like a pilgrimage to the great cities of the ancient world , for modern people this is a relaxing and enriching education . Unfortunately , construction of the Internet part of the Avatamsaka World is still ongoing .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
The Cultural Bureau of Taichung County last year organized the teachers ' pilgrimage group so as to disseminate understanding of the religious meaning of the pilgrimage and its transforming spiritual power . This year it added groups of volunteers who explained the cultural and historical significance of the festival and recounted their personal experiences with the majesty and power of the tradition .  
Frank , like James , was born in China , and had a deep emotional attachment to the country . He found it hard to understand and accept the tragic circumstances that befell Asia and was filled with inner spiritual turmoil . In 1946 , at the age of 26 , at a US military base near Hiroshima , Japan , he shot himself .  
" But when they reached middle age , and their material dreams were satisfied , they felt spiritual emptiness , as a result of which many turned to dissipated lifestyles , extramarital affairs , and religious escapism , " says Wang Chung-kwei , chairman of the Department of Psychology at Soochow University , who is a long-time student of generational differences in Taiwan . This is one reason why spiritual and religious topics have garnered so much attention in Taiwan in recent years .  
Asked what areas of personal concern they feel they most need to address , respondents answered , in order of priority : job skills or professional abilities and knowledge ( 30.1% ) ; personal economic or financial situation ( 21.5% ) ; foreign language ability ( 11.2% ) ; level of academic achievement ( 9.6% ) ; quality of life or place of residence ( 5.2% ) ; and religious or spiritual growth ( 2.6% ) .  
The changing face of the Yushan area at the hands of human beings over the last hundred years is quite clear . Although since the Japanese occupation Yushan has satisfied the so-called spiritual needs and intellectual inquiries of scholars from various disciplines , this has generally been for the one-sided benefit of mankind , done with a specific purpose in mind . And this includes the so-called " spirit of Yushan " today , which is a product of mankind 's subjective emotional projection .  
From Great Giving Hall , where the medical school is located , one can look west to the verdant Central Mountain Range , east to hanging gardens replete with flowers and trees , and north to Still Thoughts Hall , the spiritual symbol of the Tzu Chi Foundation .  
Master Hong Yi himself can be considered the first person to have introduced Western aesthetics to China . He was not only thoroughly familiar with the principles and sensibilities behind Western painting , drama , and music , but had a similarly profound understanding of Chinese poetry , painting , and calligraphy . Finally , however , he relinquished these worldly means of creating beauty , and took the vows of a monk , living in a monastery where he pursued another world of beauty through spiritual enlightenment .  
The second is the formation of the political , economic , social , spiritual and cultural life of the State , without the infamous system - inherited from the past - of roles played out in advance .  
Activities that are dangerous or harmful to the child 's harmonious physical , mental and spiritual development or are liable to jeopardize the future education and training of the child ;  
We , Heads of State and Government , are committed to an intellectual , spiritual and ethical vision for social development based on human dignity , equality , respect , mutual responsibility and cooperation .

In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .

Population growth , both on a national scale and on a more localized level ( such as urban migration ) ; the erosion of the family structure resulting in the deprivation of one of the best stabilizing elements in the lives of children ; and the erosion of societal and spiritual values which also adversely affects the judgements of parents , who may view the child as a factor of production or as an investment for economic reasons rather than an entity vested with substantive rights and inherent dignity , are other causes of the exploitation of children .  
It is affirmed by many international instruments , the most recent of which is the Convention on the Rights of the Child , adopted by the United Nations on 20 November 1989 , article 32 of which obliges States to " recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child 's education , or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development .

Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous peoples have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands , territories and resources ,

Reaffirms the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous to or interfere with the child 's education , or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development ;  
What is needed , with regard to the effective promotion and protection of those rights , is for the Organization and its Member States to take more decisive steps towards the inalienable right to development , understood not only as economic growth but also as eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of the basic material and spiritual needs of the human being in conditions of equal opportunity .

I often had the impression to have chosen here something like a monastic way of life whose timetable was divided between early _ morning working breakfasts , confabulations at the oratory tables , communal refectories ( which made me think , sometimes , of the epicurean habits of the convents in the Renaissance times ) , lengthy debates , evening meditations on the most pressing concerns and spiritual exercises to keep alive an almost ascetic tolerance .  
Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development .

General Secretary Jiang Zemin sent a letter to the National Conference on Popularizing Science , pointing out : We must strengthen in real earnest the work of popularizing science by taking it as an important task aimed at implementing the strategy of " national rejuvenation through science and education " and as an important content of socialist spiritual civilization building ; should energetically popularize scientific knowledge in the whole society ; and should advocate the spirit of science ; publicize scientific thinking ; and disseminate scientific measures ;  
The members of Jingyang County 's leading group said : In the past , we always thought economic work meant inflexible tasks and targets while the party building and the building of spiritual civilization were flexible tasks , dealing with ideological work , not " grain production . "  So , we did not have a profound understanding of the principle of " building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both " and our understanding of it was lopsided .  
Fourth , all localities in Guangdong must constantly enhance the ideological and ethical qualities , as well as the scientific and cultural qualities , of the people ; strengthen the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and bring about a well-coordinated economic and social development .  
Once we have advanced productive forces and an advanced social system , we can create more and better material and spiritual wealth ; can get a firm foothold , and can march at the head in our competition with different countries and different forces ; and can develop greater power to enhance the comprehensive national strength of our country .  
Only by continuously developing socialist culture and continuously satisfying the masses growing need for spiritual and cultural life can we provide a powerful spiritual drive and guarantee the development of productive forces .  
Some delegates indicated : During the current building of a spiritual civilization , the trend of promoting material progress to the neglect of cultural and ideological progress has yet to be checked permanently , and a major factor leading to such a situation is that the related legislation work remains relatively weak ; in view of such a problem , we ought to vigorously strengthen the legislation concerning the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .  
the building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and legal system was further intensified ; and social stability was maintained .  These achievements are the results of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core taking charge of the overall situation and providing correct leadership , and the results of all levels throughout the country implementing the central policy decision on expanding domestic demand and the series of guidelines and policies , and working hard with concerted efforts .  
Departments of spiritual promotion and cultural education must organize and guide a large batch of artistic workers and scientific promotion workers to go deep into the frontline of the socialist reform and modernization construction .  They should absorb nourishment and find materials there , create high-quality spiritual products and meet people 's demand for improving their quality of spiritual civilization .  
We must solidly and deeply launch the mass campaign of the exploration and construction of spiritual civilization and comprehensively conduct promotion and education , among all of the people , on scientific perspective on the world and methodology .  We must form a healthy atmosphere , in the entire society , which opposes superstition and ignorance and resists various false reasoning and heretical ideas .  We must continuously improve the masses ' ideological and moral levels and establish good spiritual habits .  
Guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , ideological and political work has always accompanied the party 's founding , development , maturing , and strengthening ; it has become the fine tradition and political strong point of the CPC members in uniting for struggle , conquering difficulties , and winning victory , and has become the party 's " magic weapon " in gathering together the spiritual force of the Chinese nation .  
Faced with the new situations and problems that have emerged in market economy , in accordance with the demands of the central authorities , the central departments concerned and many localities have engaged in bold exploration and practice , and regarded mass activities to build spiritual civilization as an important carrier for ideological and political work ; they have attached importance to the social education function of culture , and paid attention to giving play to the demonstration role of advanced typical examples .  
The content of the proposals is mainly : Maintaining sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , expanding domestic demand , promoting strategic economic restructuring , continuing to push ahead with reform and strengthening management , speeding up the development of science and technology and education , opening wider to the outside world , intensifying the building of a social security system , stepping up environmental protection , and strengthening the building of spiritual civilization and an honest and clean government .  
2 .  Article Three of General Work Principles shall be amended as " The national committee and local committees of CPPCC shall implement the strategy of running the country in accordance with the law ; publicize and enforce ( carry out ) the constitution , laws , and various principles and policies of the state ; and mobilize social forces to actively take part in the cause of building material civilization and socialist spiritual civilization ( assist the state organs in cracking down on criminal activities aimed at sabotaging socialism in economic field and other fields ) . "  
While creating a model street for the " no fake goods in malls and shops " activity , Hunan Road of Gulou District in Nanjing City incorporated ideological and political work as well as spiritual civilization construction into commercial enterprise management and business operation in a lively and tangible manner , producing a set of experiences in double civilizations construction and turning a shabby , cluttered , and unknown street into a golden business location , a shopping paradise , and a national model street of no fake goods in just a few years .  
Deputy Huang Qifan said : To act as the representative of the advanced productive forces and to be the direction of an advanced culture , it is necessary to continuously forge ahead and perform new meritorious deeds , concentrate our energies on the economic development and the building of spiritual civilization , and accomplish comprehensive and harmonious social development .  
With the support of the party and the state and through their own hard work , people in Tibet have changed the situation of poverty , backwardness , and ignorance left by Tibet 's old society .  Together with people of fraternal nationalities , the Tibetan people have realized happiness in their lives and are seeking modern material civilization and spiritual civilization .  
At the same time when we uphold economic construction as the central task , we must also make earnest efforts to step up the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and must bring about a comprehensive progress to both the material productive forces of our society and the ideology , ethics , and culture of our society .  The position of economic construction as a central task should remain unshaken at all times ;  
ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development ; truly step up building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and a legal system ; and endeavor to accomplish all tasks set forth by the current NPC session .  
Only when we continuously develop socialist culture and improve socialist spiritual civilization continuously can we provide a powerful spiritual dynamic force and intellectual support to economic development and overall social progress and can we continuously meet the increasingly growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
In recent years , the military 's literary and artistic workers have been conforming to the spirit of President Jiang 's directive that the military 's construction of spiritual civilization must take the lead in the whole society .  Through assiduous efforts , they have created a large group of literary and artistic works loved by troops ' rank and file and the people .  
In general , in literary and artistic creativity , the military must continue to carry forth a major theme while advocating diversification .  The military must encourage and support literary and artistic workers to go deep into troops ' lives and into the lives of the rank and file , to create excellent works reflecting the spirit of our times and encouraging the rank and file to go all out to make progress , and to provide more and better spiritual food for the broad number of commanders and soldiers .  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
With reference to the new developments in situations at home and abroad , the new developments in productive forces and the new situations occurring in economic structural reform , the new requirements of the masses of people for their material and cultural life , and the new changes taking place within the contingents of party members and cadres under the new situation , we must earnestly study , deeply understand , and wholly and accurately master the spiritual essence of this important thinking .  
However , while liberating and developing social productive forces , we must also handle numerous issues about production relations and superstructures , especially those issues in the ideological and cultural realms and must let the building of material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization coordinately develop .  
Only by developing productive forces and flourishing socialist culture can we provide powerful material and spiritual bases for realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
disseminated , in a vivid way , the materialist ideological concept of respecting science and opposing superstition among the vast number of the visitors ; helped people see more clearly the true nature and the harms of such religious cults as the " Falungong " ; and will thus prove a great help to enhancing the spiritual civilization and the scientific attainment of our people .  
Therefore , to stabilize the birthrate , we must persistently focus our attention on people ; under the general situation of the country 's social and economic growth , devote great efforts to eliminate those economic , social , and natural conditions which may affect people 's concept on child birth ; and provide a sufficient material guarantee and a strong spiritual driving power for the change in people 's concept on child birth .  
and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
In our country , now tourism has been moving onto the path of comprehensive development with three major market sectors , namely , tourism for people entering the Chinese mainland , domestic tourism , and tourism for domestic people traveling abroad , and now tourism is a large-scale industry with a huge market and great output value .  Tourism is playing a more and more important role in the national economy , and is producing positive influence for the enhancement of national quality and the development of the socialist spiritual civilization .  
On the one hand , hostile forces in the West are still bent on " Westernizing " and " dividing " us and they try their utmost to step up ideological and cultural infiltration through a multitude of channels .  They publicize capitalist values in the large volumes of imported publications , film and television products , electronic games , computer software , and other spiritual and cultural products in an effort to compete with us for the younger generation .  
The above-mentioned " Opinion " points out : Over the past five decades following the founding of New China , especially since the start of reform and opening-up , the social welfare work in this country has made considerable progress and played a positive role in building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  As far as our old-age population is concerned , however , we have a large base figure , and the number of old people is still increasing at a rapid pace .  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
The 10-year history of Pudong development also demonstrates the adherence to the strategy of Emphasizing both on economy and ideology and of the ideological education of stressing both spiritual civilization and material civilization as a key reason of the successful development of Pudong . The adherence also is the guarantee of a Party free of corruption , and of a fine social mood .  The Pudong development project stuck to the principle of To accelerate the first-class development project with first-class Party construction .  
As a result of over 20 years of reform and development , there has been great improvement of our comprehensive national strength , social productive forces , and people 's living standards ; we have progressed by leaps and bounds in building socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and legal system ; and the whole world has seen the great vitality and vigor demonstrated by socialism in China .  
Ideological-political work and economic construction must be grasped simultaneously .  This is our party 's consistent policy , which reflects the dialectical unity between economic foundation and superstructure and gives expression to the fundamental need of balanced development of material and spiritual civilization and all-round social progress .  
In short , we must , under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels , carry out vigorous ideological-political work to explain and answer the masses ' questions , resolve contradictions , straighten out their feelings , coordinate interest relationship , bring about cohesion , and mobilize all positive factors .  Only by so doing can we provide our country 's reform , opening up , and modernization with powerful spiritual motive force and ideological safeguards ; can our economic construction advance in a healthy and smooth way .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " including not only the booming and forceful songs for marching drills but also the cordial and moving songs for expressing one 's feelings and the lively and impassioned songs for collectively singing in a sing-and-response style , displays through many forms the spiritual outlook and the plain but heartfelt feelings that are unique in our military officials and soldiers .  The words and music of these songs directly relate to the lives of grassroots officials and soldiers and are concise , easily understood , musical and easily disseminated .  
By learning and singing these songs , we aim to strengthen the spiritual backbone of revolutionary military professionals , to improve the moral quality of the broad number of officials and soldiers , and to enable them to receive education , to purify their spiritual world , mold their attitude and improve their conscientiousness through aesthetic educational activities conducted in a way that influences their environment .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
Last year , after conducting research it proposed : The evil religion peddles spiritual opium in the guise of " making one into a Buddha or celestial being " , thus achieving the goal of opposing the government and society .  Therefore , thoroughly exposing and criticizing , and resolutely resisting all kinds of crooked reasons and heretical ideas are important tasks in strengthening ideological and political construction .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
To strengthen ideological and political education is of extremely great significance to upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army , stepping up our army 's revolutionization , modernization and regularization , providing a strong spiritual motive force for " winning in war " , and providing a political guarantee for " being immune to degeneration " .  
The issues of belief and conviction involve many major issues including our guiding thought , social system , cadres ' contingent building , as well as people 's thinking that have a bearing on the rise and fall and success and failure of our party .  Faced with tough challenges in the new millenium , and at a time of comprehensively pushing forward our cause into the new century , we need a strong spiritual force even more .  
Only Marxism discovered for the first time the law of development of human society , namely existence decides consciousness , material production decides spiritual production , economic foundation decides super structure , the relations between productive force and production and the contradictions between economic foundation and superstructure push social progress .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
At a gathering in Guangzhou on 18 May for the destruction of smuggled and pirated CD 's on an unprecedented scale , Yu Youxian , director of the Press and Publication Administration and also director of the State Copyright Bureau , vehemently declared : " In the contest of all-round national strength today , and especially in the future , the main and most reliable resource for the Chinese nation is our own spiritual innovative ability ; it is precisely our national spiritual innovative ability that is harmed by infringement of copyright and pirating . "  
Focusing on and serving this center of economic construction , constantly strengthening and improving the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization to fully display its role of clearing up doubts , remove apprehensions , and inspire spirit can vigorously safeguard and promote the building and development of the socialist material civilization .  
Nevertheless , it should also be noticed that some leading cadres still do not have sufficient understanding about the importance of ideological and political work and that they grasp economic work in a relatively solid way but grasp the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization in a relatively vague way .  
We should make full use of these favorable conditions , adhere to the mass line , fulfill the work amid the actual activities of the material and spiritual productions of the masses of the people , let ideological education run through the handling of solid affairs , and guide the masses to enhance their spiritual realm through resolving realistic problems .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , many developments have taken place in their spiritual and cultural life and the masses have proposed new demands for spiritual and cultural life .  This requires that we profoundly study the characteristics of the times , have a firm grip on the times , and continuously probe for new forms , methods , means , and mechanisms .  And this is the key to making ideological and political work more purposeful and more inspiring .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .  
Socialist spiritual civilization is being developed more and more effectively , and comprehensive social progress is being made .  The progressive socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is turning into a great mental force rallying the Chinese nation as a whole .  
They should transform concern from the Party , the central government and the Central Military Commission into the powerful impetus of self-strengthening and self-sufficiency , struggling to press their way forward with a pioneering spirit and with courageous contributions .  They should become an advanced collective that makes contributions to constructing our country 's material and spiritual civilizations .  
Each region must pay thorough attention to developing spiritual and cultural products and healthy entertainment activities that have the ability to imperceptibly influence people 's ideological views and moral sentiments so as to allow the masses to achieve enlightenment and mold their sentiments in a relaxed and happy atmosphere .  
cherish the current gratifying reform , opening-up , and modernization situation ; and initiate what is useful to the Internet and do away with the harmful while performing their duties .  Only by so doing will we be able to actually make contributions to the construction of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and to pioneer a vast , unlimited path for the development of China 's Internet .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
This requires that creators of literary and artistic works should persistently focus on realistic topics when choosing between historical and realistic ones , and focus on military-oriented topics when choosing between military-oriented topics and non-military ones .  These creators should be enthusiastically concerned about the great process of military construction , firmly take the pulse of life in military camps , and make our excellent spiritual products the satisfactory guide in creating literary and artistic works .  
and to check corruption , one should stand up for healthy trends " .  Only when we arm the minds of the vast numbers of party-member cadres with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and only when we educate and guide them to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values , can they develop a strong spiritual pillar , a correct understanding of right and wrong , and an effective political immunity .  
They should learn their lofty passion of fighting for the motherland , their fighting will for struggling persistently and their spiritual attainment of continuous pursuit .  Officers and soldiers throughout the military and the armed police forces should , as the athletes have done , work hard in training , make unswerving efforts , be brave in struggling for " gold medals " in their own posts , and accomplish more magnificent achievements for the People 's Republic of China .  
Since the implementation of the " Ninth Five-Year " Plan , we have scored glorious achievements in promoting spiritual civilization , while attaining tremendous successes in developing material civilization .  All this has provided a gigantic spiritual motive force and a strong ideological guarantee for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , precisely because of the adoption of the principle of persistently carrying out reforms and opening up , we can score today 's brilliant achievements in the development of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and our party can withstand the tests of various difficulties and risks .  The socialist system in our country can also gain strong vigor and dynamism under the eventful and changing international situation .  
Dialectical materialism adheres to the unity of material and spirit , emphasizes the decisive role played by material product in the social development and gives full light to the active role played by spiritual strength in the course where people reconstruct the objective world .  
The spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will is the precious spiritual wealth made by the Party and the military through prolonged revolutionary and construction practices as well as the embodiment of the positive spiritual state of both Party members and revolutionary military professionals .  
As students of military academies , we shoulder the historic mission of relying on science and technology to build a strong army and accelerate the modernization of our army 's armament and equipment .  We must more consciously strengthen our cultivation of Marxist theories and scientific spirit , arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge , and exert to spread the fruits of socialist spiritual and cultural progress .  We must never allow fallacies of " Falungong " to contaminate our sacred school campuses .  
Countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals would dedicate everything in them to liberating the Chinese nation , bringing happiness to the people and revitalizing the country .  The reform , opening up and the development of the socialist market economy have added enormous vitality and historical progress to our construction of material and spiritual civilizations .  
The spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is incompatible with those corrupt ideas by nature .  Vigorously promoting this spirit can effectively sweep away such corruption and enable us to maintain a strong will to fight , to maintain lofty ideas , firm stances and the correct direction so as to formulate spiritual strengths , values and public opinions beneficial to the reform and construction .  
Without the lofty ideal of being unselfish , afraid of nothing and ethical in fulfilling one 's official duties , could we maintain the political quality of the people 's army and walk at the cutting edge of society as a whole in the socialist spiritual civilization construction despite the infiltration of money worship , hedonism and extreme individualism ?  
In the face of the ever-changing international situation and intense international competition , without a lofty idea , firm conviction and powerful spiritual mainstay , it is impossible for comrades of the entire party and people throughout the country to make our country powerful , invigorate our nation and basically realize our socialist modernization in the middle of this century .  Without a strong rallying power and brilliant creativity , it is impossible for them to do so .  Without an indomitable will and concerted efforts , it is also impossible for them to do so .  
Firm ideals and convictions are the ideological basis of assuring our revolutionary military professionals are politically qualified and maintaining their essential qualities and the spiritual backbone and resources for these professionals to live through tests , overcome difficulties and make achievements in their careers .  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
In conducting major military exercises , combating floods of three rivers and going to the rescue hurriedly in 1998 , holding the grand military parade of the century , marching into Hong Kong and Macao and stationing there to perform defensive duties , our army has demonstrated its spiritual outlook of being courageous , indomitable , and invincible and the good image of being a mighty and civilized army .  
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
In light of China 's national conditions and according to the people 's wishes , the Chinese government aims to build a democratic and modernized country with a high level of civilization under the rule of law , and actively learn from the beneficial experiences and cultural achievements of other countries .  While maintaining social stability , it also aims to expedite development , strengthen the democratic legal system , promote spiritual civilization , and continuously push forward the development of the human rights cause .  
They should unite more closely around the party CentralCommittee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner ofDeng Xiaoping Theory , seriously implement the important thinking of " threerepresents , " strengthen the party building and improve the ideological andpolitical levels of the military , and provide a powerful spiritual motivationand reliable political guarantee for " winning in wars " and " neverdegenerating . "  
Huzhou City Mayor Huang Kunming said : Comrade Wang Wei has left precious spiritual wealth for the people of Huzhou . We will publicize his strong patriotic and collective spirit among the cadres and masses of Huzhou , turn the inspired patriotic passion into strength for building up our country , and , by working harder , quicken the pace of economic development and build up China 's national strength .  
Once people practice Falungong , they would place themselves under the control of the cult 's tightly knitted organization and its cruel spiritual shackles .  Gradually the practitioners would become depressed and apathetic , with no sense of responsibility toward society and family .  After losing their basic human nature , obsessed Falungong practitioners could become extraordinarily cruel and violent and could do incredible things .  
The " three represents " advocates the realm of a communist 's lofty thought , which is going with development of productive forces , advocating advanced cultures , and giving primary consideration in all ways to the interests of the people .  This spirit is a powerful spiritual driving force for us to ensure thorough implementation of all work and to truthfully realize the demand that the party exercises absolute leadership over the military .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that in the entire process of the modernization of Shanghai , it is necessary to adhere to the principle of laying equal emphasis on both material and spiritual civilizations , and be strong in both , further strengthen the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , democracy and legal system , and promote comprehensive social progress .  
Zeng Qinghong pointed out : In commanding various rural work with the important thinking of " three represents , " we must devote major efforts to advancing the building of socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and the legal system and safeguarding social stability in the countryside to provide an ideological guarantee and good sociopolitical environment for rural economic and social development .  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
The Chinese working class is indeed the representative of advanced social productive forces and production relations , is indeed the basic driving force that promotes social development and historical advances , is indeed the main force in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and is indeed the leading class of the people 's republic .  
The fine traditions and the fine work style of our army are the precious spiritual wealth , as well as the source of the invincible power , of our army ; and this military history is therefore required to fully embody the glorious traditions and the fine work style of our army , so that it can be used as a good teaching material for our education on traditions among our troops .  
The basic question of the trade union work is an issue of safeguarding rights .  All work of the trade union should be carried out in close connection with this most fundamental issue , that is , safeguarding the economic interests and democratic rights of workers and staff members and fulfilling their spiritual and cultural needs .  
This is set to have an important , profound , and far-reaching impact on ensuring the delivery of national defense education to the whole people , propelling national defense construction in the new era , reinforcing the whole people 's national defense awareness and national cohesion , raising the quality of the whole people , and even promoting the construction of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Huang Ju told the pacesetters : You have embodied the spiritual style of Chinese servicemen in the new era .  Your spirit of studying and working hard at your posts and serving the motherland will particularly play a great encouraging and exemplary role for the broad ranks of Shanghai cadres and young comrades in further arousing their enthusiasm and creativity , and comprehensively pushing forward the socialist modernization program .  
upheld the principle of uniting , educating , and redeeming the majority ; engaged ourselves in the arduous , patient , and painstaking work of straightening out the thinking of " Falungong " practitioners ; and have successfully helped thousands upon thousands of " Falungong " practitioners see the error of their ways , make a clean break with the crooked ideas and fallacies of the " Falungong , " extricate themselves from Li Hongzhi 's spiritual control , and return to the normal track of their work and life .  
These words - - which have won universal praise - - and the noble spirit conveyed in them have greatly touched the hearts of a large number of people , and have influenced generation after generation of the masses and Communist party members .  They have become a kind of treasured spiritual wealth of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese nation , and have also become enduring red classics .  
This sheer nonsense created by Li Hongzhi has belittled the remarkable achievements China has attained in its building of a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization at the present stage , and has fully exposed the anti-human essence of the " Falungong . "  
We should further improve the quality of all people 's knowledge of law and the level of institutionalized management in society and create an ever more favorable legal environment for the building of the material and spiritual civilizations .  To do so , it is necessary for us to continue to give in-depth publicity to and conduct extensive education in the legal system among the citizens .  
It is the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force inspiring people of different ethnic backgrounds in the whole region to fight bravely in unity .  It is a powerful ideological weapon enabling us to know and transform the world .  We must always uphold it without wavering .  
Role models of demobilized military cadres that won awards at this conference are representatives of the excellent demobilized military cadres working in every front line throughout the country .  Their advanced deeds and lofty ideology embody the new spiritual outlook of the majority of demobilized military cadres , being precious spiritual resources .  The entire military should satisfactorily study and vigorously disseminate their deeds and ideology .  
In response to a reporter 's question , the spokesman said : We have taken note that to implement their separatist line in an accelerated way , the Taiwan authorities have taken many steps to cut off the cultural and spiritual links between Taiwan and the mainland .  The Taiwan leader 's refusal to admit he is a Chinese and recognize the principle of one China and his deliberate attempt to evade the basic fact that the two sides of the strait belong to one country are the most representative of this .  
Last year , in the course of formulating Beijing Municipality 's tenth five-year plan for economic and social development , the draft was twice discussed at the standing committee of the municipal political consultation conference .  Members of the political consultation conference provided many useful and constructive opinions on the general framework of the tenth five-year plan , the strategy for the capital 's sustainable development , urban construction and management , and spiritual civilization development .  
But what Taiwan lacks is not this factor .  Taiwan 's multi-party system and the very lacking and fantastically complex political-economic system including the spiritual state of her social , economic , political fronts , are the results of a relatively developed economy rather than relative backsliding .  
Marxism is our guiding ideology on building our party and state , the guide to actions in all our work , the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force pushing people of all nationalities of the entire country to fight for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through concerted efforts , and also a powerful ideological weapon for our efforts to understand the world and to reform the objective world and subjective world .  
This important thinking came from practice and guide practice .  Once this important thinking is combined with practice , it will become a powerful spiritual and material strength and will greatly advance construction of party-building and comprehensive military construction .  
Patriotism is a banner for mobilizing and motivating the billion Chinese people to struggle in unison , an enormous force for driving society and history forward , and a common spiritual pillar for people of all nationalities .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to implement the strategic policy for the new period and to closely center on the requirements of military struggle , working to provide sustained , adequate spiritual motive force for " being able to win " .  
The guiding principle for Tibet 's work in the new period has further aroused our consciousness in opposing separatism and safeguarding stability .  In exposing and criticizing Dalai in recent years , we have been waging a tit-for-tat struggle against him in the spiritual sphere , which is the main battleground , to fight confusion and correct foolishness .  We have done a great deal of highly effective work in strengthening the buildup of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Scientific and technical workers are part of China 's working class , they carry out courageous exploration and make constant progress , so they are the main inheritors and disseminators of scientific and cultural knowledge of humankind and play an irreplaceable role in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization . 
Without enhancing the level of productive forces , it is impossible to consolidate the political power , maintain social stability , improve the living standards of the people , and develop the spiritual civilization and the democratic and legal system .  
Large numbers of publishing workers have persisted in serving the people , socialism , and the overall situation in the work of the party and state ; they have made remarkable achievements in publicizing Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , in disseminating and accumulating scientific and cultural knowledge , in satisfying the spiritual and cultural needs of the people , and in promoting the building of the material and spiritual civilizations ; and they have played an important role in reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
New interpersonal relationships and healthy , scientific and civilized way of life are taking shape .  The strengthening of our ideological and moral building has become our powerful political advantage that enables our party to lead the people to overcome various kinds of difficulties and dangers .  It has become an important spiritual force that enables us to seize the opportunities , speed up development and promote all-round progress of the society .  
The party has persisted in unfolding the main themes , advocating diversified development of our cultural undertakings , and vigorously developing our literature and art , press and publication , and radio and television undertakings to constantly satisfy our people 's increasing spiritual and cultural demands .  Cultural life of our urban and rural people is rich and colorful .  
We should persist in sticking to the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , vigorously bring about our prosperous socialist culture and make efforts to provide our reform , opening up and modernization with a powerful spiritual motive power and ideological guarantee .  
second , it is even more difficult to do this because we are confronted with the new situation characterized by the new scientific and technological revolution in the 21st century and the fierce competition worldwide , with a serious challenge from our double mission to achieve China 's modernization , and with the magnificent task of building a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The two major theoretical results are the crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the party and the people , the valuable spiritual wealth of our party , and the great banner that guides us to advance triumphantly .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .  
We must insist on grasping two links simultaneously and being firm on both hands , intensify the construction of spiritual civilization , arm people with scientific theory , guide people with correct public opinion , mold people with lofty spirit , inspire people with excellent works , and provide powerful spiritual motivation with reform , opening up , and modernization .  
To practice the requirement of representing the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must enhance the building of socialist spiritual civilization , persistently educate the people with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , effectively implement the strategy of relying on science and education for national regeneration , promote the enhancement of the ideological and moral integrity and scientific and cultural attainments of the whole nation .  
We must base ourselves on the new practice of social life today and on the new development of the times , strengthen theoretical study , conscientiously sum up the experience , tackle problems in real earnest , make explorations in the midst of practice , make innovations in the midst of explorations , and move forward in the midst of innovations .  While doing a better job in the building of material civilization , we must keep pushing ahead with the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
To study the " speech , " we should hold high the advance banner of China 's advanced culture , strive to create and carry forward a new culture that embodies the requirements of revolution , construction , and reform , satisfy the growing needs of the masses of the people for spiritual culture , and push forward the development and progress of socialist society in a comprehensive way .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech delivered at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China points out the Party 's historical task and objective in the new century and provides a powerful ideological weapon and enormous spiritual driving force that encourages the majority of Party members to live through all kinds of tests and forever maintain the advanced nature of Party members .  
Second , we must throw ourselves into red-hot revolution and construct reality , research the actual major questions of the Party , the government and the masses , and provide an accurate direction for public opinion and support for spiritual intelligence for the great leap forward in Tibetan development and long-term political stability .  This is the glorious and important responsibility of workers in the social sciences .  
Watching the exhibits , Ding Guangen praised the success of the exhibition .  He expressed the hope that the entire society would devote more efforts to building spiritual civilization , give wide publicity to scientific theories , disseminate the advanced culture , cultivate an elevated mind , carry forward justice , popularize scientific knowledge , advocate the scientific spirit , eradicate the soil that engenders " Falungong " and all other decadent ideologies and cultures , and make it a social practice to oppose cults and promote civilization .  
The PLA , armed police , and law enforcement units stationed in Tibet are strong pillars and loyal guards who safeguard the motherland 's frontier areas and Tibet 's stability .  They are important forces for building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations in Tibet . They must continue to carry forward their fine traditions and work styles , ensure their own construction , strengthen their unity with the local governments , civilian authorities , and the people , and make new contributions to Tibet 's stability and development .  
These reporters visited almost all the companies and forward posts in the coastal and frontier areas of the country and sent out more than 400 news reports , zealously eulogizing frontier servicemen 's heroic achievements and mental outlook of fighting arduously and bravely making contributions .  Besides , these reports have vividly demonstrated the historically great changes in coastal and border defense and fully reflected the border areas ' new progress in army-government and army-people unity and material and spiritual civilizations .  
In the new historical conditions , society will be diversified and the situation will become more complex .  In light of this , only with a clear theoretical understanding can one take a firm political stance , take initiatives , and hold loftier spiritual ideals .  
To profoundly study and implement the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , the meeting decided to adopt several measures on the basis of study : first , the central group of the Central Discipline-Inspection Commission would set aside a period of time for carefully studying and discussing specific topics in Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , so as to achieve a profound understanding and accurate grasp of the spiritual essence .  
As a powerful ideological weapon and tremendous spiritual motivation for army building , the " three represents " constitute a reliable guarantee of the army 's always keeping a firm and correct political orientation .  
Proceeding from the profound changes in the domestic and international situation faced by our party and from major historical tasks shouldered by our party , the speech systematically and penetratingly expounded the scientific connotation and the spiritual essence of the important idea of " three represents . "  
Proceeding from the intense changes in the domestic and international situation facing the party , and from the major historic task shouldered by the party , he comprehensively and profoundly expounded the scientific meaning and spiritual essence of the important thinking of the " three represents . "  
As is known to all , the infamous Yasukuni Shrine is a symbol of Japanese militarism and the spiritual pillar of Japan 's launching of the aggressive wars .  Flaunting the big banner of " national Shinto , " the shrine has been fooling people into believing the nonsense that the soul of the dead will return to Yasukuni Shrine , and had been driving the Japanese people to lay down their lives on the battlefields for Japan 's aggressive wars .  
We should play a vanguard role in the building of a spiritual civilization , guide the masses of all ethnic groups to emancipate their minds and renew their concepts , advocate science , and provide a strong spiritual motive power for economic growth in border areas .  We should play the role of a commando in the country 's large-scale development of its western region , firmly establish the thinking that we must develop and bring wealth to border areas while defending and consolidating them ;  
literature and art work should be concentrated on creating excellent works in larger quantity ; ideological and political work should be concentrated on enhancing understanding , unifying ideas , and improving its pertinence and practical results ; and the building of spiritual civilization should be concentrated on consolidation , enhancement , extension , and radiation and on spreading the experience gained at selected units to , and promote , the entire area .  
Second , the party 's basic theory , basic line , and basic program as well as numerous other principles and policies at the initial stage of socialism are extremely invaluable spiritual wealth attainted by the party after scientifically having summed up domestic and international historical experience , positive and negative .  
Our thorough study , correct understanding , and proper implementation of the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech in the new century is bound to turn the spiritual strength of the Speech into tremendous material strength and spur our party and state undertakings to advance from victory to victory .  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
Officials were of the view that on-line information should be able to satisfy the needs of the people 's just and healthy spiritual life , allow the world to understand China fully , accurately , and in a timely way , and resist the ideological and cultural infiltration of harmful information and its pernicious social influence .

The grand military review for celebrating the 50th founding anniversary of New China demonstrated to the whole world our army 's fine spiritual outlook and tremendous achievements in modernization .  This military review also greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm and the national pride of the people throughout the country .  
Third , in the face of the mutual impacts of the various different ideologies and cultures in the world , it is not enough for us to depend only on the method of controlling the information flow ; and we must also improve the quality of socialist cultural products and give shape to a common ideal and a spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation in the whole society .  
Since we have consistently attached importance to and persistently grasped ideological and political work as the central link , the central policy decision has deeply penetrated into people 's minds , and this has effectively eliminated interference in ideological understanding , mobilized the activism and initiative of all sectors , formed a powerful spiritual motive force for impelling the work , and ensured the smooth implementation of the central policy decision .  
In his speech , Jiang Chunyun said : As mass organizations that assist the government in mobilizing people to practice family planning , family planning associations at all levels have , over the past 20 years , effectively carried out work around the basic national policy of family planning under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels .  They have played an increasingly prominent role in grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , poverty relief , community development , spiritual civilization , and international exchanges and cooperation .  
Family planning associations at the grass-roots level should take an active part in exercising democratic management and supervision over family planning and making family planning matters in the villages known to the public , and advance grass-roots democracy , legal institutions , and spiritual civilization , so as to promote social and economic development and political stability .  
We should build an advanced culture to meet the people 's growing needs in cultural life and provide the productive forces development with a spiritual motive force as well as intellectual support .  
During his inspection , Li Tieying also listened to reports on Chongqing 's ideas and work on participating in the extensive development of the western region .  In addition , he inspected private enterprises and demonstration areas for national spiritual civilization building , as well as demonstration streets for the national activities against counterfeit goods , the civilization community , and experimental primary schools .  
Fourth , colleges , universities , scientific and technological research institutes , and hi-tech enterprises in the vicinity of the S &amp; T park should also make contributions to local development , converting scientific and technological achievements , fostering professional personnel , promoting education , paying taxes according to law , building a civilized community , and promoting socialist spiritual civilization .  
Li Lanqing said at the end : To popularize scientific knowledge across the whole society , to establish scientific thinking , to promote scientific spirit , and to publicize scientific methods suit the need for implementing the strategy of developing China through science and education , for upgrading the masses ' qualities , and for facilitating a healthy development in our socialist material and spiritual civilization construction .  The tasks also suit the need for eliminating the poison inflicted by ignorance , superstition , various pseudosciences , and antisciences ; for safeguarding social stability ;  
Second , it expresses their discontent of the West for ignoring Asian ideological traditions all these years .  What is more , it also reflects a kind of anxiety shown by people under the challenge of global economic globalization .  In the present-day world when economic activities become more " interdependent , " it is necessary to consider establishing some moral consensus on the spiritual and cultural levels .  
since our party represents the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , it must persistently take Marxism as the guide , inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , study and absorb all the fruits of human civilization , and continually build and create socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , so that material and spiritual civilization will develop in coordinated fashion and promote the all-round progress of society ;  
Since people 's spiritual and cultural demands are restricted by historical , social , or personal factors on the one hand , and is plastic in nature on the other .  Therefore , guiding people 's spiritual and cultural life is both necessary and indispensable .  
under the guidance of Marxism , to constantly build and develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics that is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future so as to bring about coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and promote comprehensive social progress ;  
Thirdly , the ultimate goal of our efforts to liberate and develop our productive forces and to build a socialist spiritual civilization is to satisfy the people 's growing material demands in their everyday life , that is , to better represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses and serve them wholeheartedly .  
In the final analysis , all struggles carried out by our party were aimed at liberating and developing productive forces ; and all guiding principles and policies adopted by our party are aimed at eventually ensuring continuous development of productive forces , boosting national economic development , raising the overall national strength , building socialist material and spiritual civilizations , satisfying the people 's increasing material and cultural needs , and becoming more representative of the people 's fundamental interests .  
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
We must understand , think over , and resolve , in accordance with the intrinsic relations among society , economics , politics , and culture , the question of how our party can better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture , always uphold Marxism as the guide , and strive to understand and master the characteristics and laws of cultural construction so as to continuously create and push ahead the culture with Chinese characteristics , develop socialist materialist and spiritual civilizations in a coordinated way , and achieve overall social progress .  
In the historical process of the new emerging out of the old , mankind 's advanced culture consciously represents the mainstream of the times , the orientation of social development , and the will of the people and is an active and dynamic spiritual force for guiding and promoting historical progress .  
The leadership collective of the third generation of the party with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has all the more attached importance to and strengthened the building of socialist spiritual civilization , made continuous new advances in this aspect while persisting in taking economic construction as the center and paying close attention to the building of material civilization , and clearly and definitely set and gradually and systematically expounded the task of building a culture with Chinese characteristics .  
However , we should fully understand the importance , protracted nature , and arduousness of intensifying the building of spiritual civilization , firmly foster the political awareness and the awareness on general interest , responsibility , ideological front , and innovation , and further increase the sense of mission , urgency , and the age , so as to carry out the building of spiritual civilization in a still more vivid , enlivened , and solid way .  
Ding Guangen stressed in his speech that to intensify the building of spiritual civilization , we must seriously study and put into effect the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , persist in taking Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide to study how to answer the major strategic questions that have a bearing on the overall situation of developing the party and state 's cause and the major ideological and theoretical questions that are posed in real life and followed by cadres and masses with interest ; 
The key to building spiritual civilization lies in always grasping the work with perseverance and having it effectively carried out .  Specifically speaking , it should be carried out for the all-round elevation of the people 's quality among all social organizations at the grassroots level .  
persist in taking Marxism as a guide , proceed from the reality of the initial stage of socialism , emancipate the mind , seek truth from facts , conduct bold innovation , and correctly handle the relations between communities and residents , other units stationed in the communities , and pertinent government administrative organs ; penetratingly explore the organizational forms and structure of communities which are suited to the requirements of the building of spiritual civilization , and positively bring forth new ideas on the community management system and activity modes that are well received by the people .  
Hu Kangsheng said : To amend the Marriage Law , we should proceed from China 's actual conditions , uphold the socialist marriage and family system , adhere to practicing the marriage system in terms of freedom of marriage , monogamy , and equality of men and women , maintain the equal , harmonious , and civilized matrimonial family relationship , safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women , children , and the aged , and give an impetus to the building of socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  
The promulgation and implementation of this law have played a positive role in establishing and safeguarding the equal , harmonious , and civilized matrimonial family relationship , promoting the building of the socialist spiritual civilization and social progress , and maintaining social stability .  
It is necessary to thoroughly understand the new and higher demands set by the " three represents " on the building the armed forces ideologically and politically .  It is necessary to further emancipate the mind , update concepts , courageously blaze new trails , and strive to make ideological and political work more lively , solid and effective in light of the new situation and tasks in order to provide a powerful spiritual motive force and a reliable political guarantee for " winning victories " and " preventing degeneration . "  
To achieve practical results in ideological and political work , it is necessary to closely combine it with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , and concentrate efforts on masking an issue of " new development " ; we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , ways , means , and mechanisms , and continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
By grasping the four " new " things , upholding the four " close connections , " and carrying out work in a creative way , ideological and political work will be closer to the era , the masses , and daily life , will be effectively intensified and improved , and will also be able to give fuller play to its role as spiritual motive force and political guarantee .  
All localities and all military units should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central ideological and political work conference .  They should launch the activities of building spiritual civilization through the joint efforts of servicemen and civilians and promote coordinated development of spiritual and material civilization .  
Fourth , in close connection with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , methods , means , and mechanisms to continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
The circular points out : Since the establishment of the national class-A soccer tournament system in 1994 , China has accelerated the socialization and industrialization of soccer matches .

Labor models and advanced workers are the outstanding representatives of China 's working class and millions upon millions of the laboring masses .

On the other hand , in recent years , some local public security organs have concentrated on the building of a material civilization to the neglect of the building of a spiritual civilization and have overlooked and slackened their efforts in promoting their ideological and political work .  
The forum seriously studied and implemented the spirit of the important speech delivered by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the Central Ideological and Political Work Conference , discussed how to enhance the convincing and combat effectiveness of theoretical work , how to make ideological and political work more specific and effective , and how to make propaganda , ideological work , and spiritual civilization better serve the development of the west region .  
All the propaganda , ideological , and cultural front and all spiritual and cultural products should publicize scientific theory , spread advanced culture , portray a fine spirit , and encourage healthy social tendencies .  
The constant improvement in the quality of science , technology and culture of cadres at all levels and the people of all ethnic groups , and the constant increase in the sense of democracy and the legal system and the expansion of the spiritual civilization will create a favorable investment and development environment for developing the western region .  The improvement in such environment itself is a kind of important fundamental construction , which is just as important as the construction of infrastructure and other hardware .  
After leaving the hall , Buddhist Master Shenghui , member of the Chinese religious and spiritual leaders delegation and vice president of the Buddhist Association of China , told Chinese and foreign reporters : " It was unwise for the Dalai Lama to dispatch a representative to read his letter to the Millennium World Peace Summit , though he was clever not to attend the summit .  As a result , the move has disrupted the normal process of the summit , which is not in harmony with the general atmosphere of the meeting . "  
Ding Guangen said : Building civilized communities is urgently needed for enhancing the ideological and political work and building a spiritual civilization , for gearing up our urban construction and management , for improving the living environment of residents and safeguarding social and political stability , and for building close party-mass ties and consolidating the foundation of our party as a ruling party .  
We resolutely oppose bureaucracy and formalism .  We should persist in raising the quality of residents and the level of civilization in communities as our main objective , strive to build modern urban communities marked by fine environments , good order , quality service , and successful management .  We should also form a moral standard in communities that respects the advanced , helps each other in the spirit of solidarity , upholds the good , suppresses the bad , and aggressively makes progress so as to achieve coordinate development in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
His advanced deeds and noble spirit fully embody the lofty realm of communists and revolutionary soldiers in consciously practicing " three represents , " and demonstrates the spiritual outlook of teachers of military academies who heroically blaze new trails , are content in serving as the ladder for others to get ahead , and work with selflessly devotion .

We should publish more works of excellence to satisfy the increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .

The " PRC Sports Law " has incorporated athletic activities in rural areas under the legal system .  
The Law on the National Common Language adopted at this meeting will provide a correct guide for the normalization , standardization , and healthy growth of our national common spoken and written languages ; and it is therefore conducive to the country 's reunification and national unity , and to our building of socialist material and spiritual civilizations .

These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
We must stick to the principle that both material progress and spiritual progress should be promoted in real earnest , with neither aspect being neglected .  We must earnestly step up spiritual civilization building and democratic legal system building , vigorously develop the advanced culture , and provide the campaign to " build first-rate city " with a powerful spiritual driving force , intellectual support , and legal guarantee .  
The building of spiritual social regions , civilized townships , and cultural industries were focused on , mass spiritual civilization construction activities were expanded in-depth , and all types of work were advanced overall .  All of this played an active role in promoting reform and development , and in protecting social stability .  
We must uphold economic development as the center , and integrate spiritual civilization construction work with city and rural development work , as well as with business work for all industries and trades .  We must put efforts into raising the ideological and moral quality of people , and also their science and cultural quality , thus providing spiritual motivation and ideological assurance for modernization construction .  
During the July-September period , public security organs across the country , with close coordination of other departments , launched a campaign to tighten the management of places of entertainment and service .  They carried out a severe crackdown on prostitution , gambling , drug trafficking , and other social evils .  They also tightened the management of places where electronic games were available .  They have made contributions to improving the social environment and promoting a socialist spiritual civilization .  
From their practice of changing Jilin'sbackward look , the city party committee and the city government of Jilin have learned that to bring the spiritual civilization building into factories , mines , and communities in real terms , what counts is to introduce a new practice of activating the ideological-political work from bottom to top instead of the other way round , and to move the foothold of the work from the previous practice of holding oneself responsible for higher authorities to a new practice of holding oneself responsible for lower levels .  
It must also help bring into play the initiative and creativeness of broadcast workers , help combine social benefits and economic benefits , help promote the sound and prosperous development of the broadcasting industry , and better meet the growing spiritual and cultural needs of the masses of the people .  
I hope that you would treasure your duty and mission , cultivate a strong enterprising spirit and sense of responsibility , and devote your thoughts and energies to the successful running of the broadcasting industry .  You should learn , learn and learn again , penetrate , penetrate and penetrate still deeper .  You should draw wisdom and nourishments from the fervent activities of reform and construction and from the practice of the masses in creating a beautiful future in order to improve your political quality , spiritual outlook and vocational level .  
The tourism areas and tourism service units should vigorously carry out healthy and beneficial tourism activities , exploit potential humanity values of sight-seeing spots for tourism , combine tourism development with efforts to enhance socialist spiritual civilization construction , advocate the national culture through the tourism window , enhance patriotism education , and promote international cultural exchanges .  
In this way we can form and develop a positive and upward-looking public opinion environment throughout society , enable scientific theory and correct ideology to play the dominant role in social life activities , enable the cadres and masses to maintain good spiritual features , and continually consolidate and develop the basis of the common ideal of the people of all nationalities throughout the country in their united endeavors .  
it must make efforts to combine the theoretical nature of propaganda and education in ideals , beliefs , and ethical concepts with the practical nature of people 's daily life and work , and succeed in carrying out this work in a variety of forms , in a lively and vivid way that the masses enjoy and accept , which can answer problems of ideological understanding existing among the masses and continually play a tremendous role as a spiritual pillar in the masses ' work and endeavors .  
It is necessary to vigorously carry forward the lofty ideology and spirit of selfless dedication of the labor models , cultivate a worker rank with ideals , ethics , culture , and discipline , guide and stimulate the workers to actively plunge into the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and persistently influence and lead forward the whole of society with the advanced ideology of the working class .  
This is the first time that advanced productive forces and advanced culture , that is , material and spiritual civilization , have been scientifically and dialectically linked to the fundamental interests of the people , and that advanced nature and the fundamental interests of the people have been unified in the people 's historic practice .  
conscientiously uphold the principle of " attending to two types of work [ the building of a material civilization and a spiritual civilization ] simultaneously , attaching equal importance of both " ; effect temporary as well as permanent solutions to existing problems , and intensify their efforts in eliminating the root causes of these problems ; and further promote , in a deep-going manner , the government 's work of building an uncorrupted administration and fighting against corruption .  
In their speeches , they also put forward opinions and proposals on how to better maintain and improve the CPC-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation system , further deepen reforms , promote sustained economic development , safeguard the political situation of stability and unity , enhance socialist democracy and the building of the legal system , and advance the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the new year .  
In the incident , several people obsessed with " Falungong , " who were under the spiritual control of Li Hongzhi , attempted to burn themselves to death , turning a blind eye to both love in the world and love in their families and displaying not the least virtue or intuitive knowledge as human beings , and have thus destroyed themselves , their families , and their children as well .  
Charged with a heavy task , the women 's federations or their organizations at all levels should give full scope to the unique superiority of the broad masses of women and families in resisting an evil cult ; should help " Falungong " practitioners free themselves from the spiritual control of the evil cult ideologically , organizationally , and once and for all ; and should help them keep abreast with the pace of the times by enjoying to the full a warm or progressive life brought by science and civilization as well .  
What they are pursuing is no longer a simple " Cold-War mentality , " but an " imperial strategy " of seizing the sphere of influence , and their ideological basis is narrow ideology and ultra-nationalism .  And , with the two highly destructive " poisonous spiritual arrows " directly aimed at China , a marvelous strategic sight has taken shape , in which all the major forces with great interests in the region point their strategic focus at China .  
Everyone pointed out that the people 's army is the loyal protector of the people 's interests , that we must take the lead to implement and propagate the spiritual civilization of socialism , to study , discuss and practice science , to spread advanced civilization , to criticize the superstitions of evil religion , and to further tackle every task in order to provide a dependable assurances of security in realizing the magnificent goals planned by the 15th National People 's Congress .  
The political system may vary from one country to another , but all countries in the world share the same task of cracking down on evil cults and drug trafficking .  He called on all nations in the world to make joint efforts to thoroughly eliminate evil cults and drugs by casting aside their political differences and join hands in building a healthier and better living environment for all human being and creating a clean world without drugs , without pollution , without evil cults , and without spiritual opium for future generations .  
He said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , the sports front persisted in carrying out the party 's principles and policies in the physical culture work , persistently took the improvement of the people 's physique as its principal task , and adhered to the principle of combining popularization with enhancement and promoting the coordinated development of mass sports and athletic competition , so that it has scored tremendous achievements and made significant contributions to the building of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  
Through vigorously popularizing scientific , healthy , and civilized modes of fitness among the broad masses , we should enable the physical culture work to play its unique role in uniting the broad masses , maintaining social stability , and promoting the building of both material and spiritual civilizations .  
Li Peng fully affirmed Guangdong 's major achievements in building material and spiritual civilization .  During the inspection tour , Li Peng had an informal discussion with relevant responsible comrades from the provincial people 's congress to solicit their opinions and suggestions on the NPC Standing Committee 's work report .  He also toured enterprises and neighborhoods to gain first-hand information on enterprise reform and urban construction , and to extend cordial greetings to manufacturing and office workers on the frontlines of production and management .  
and so on .  People who are paranoid are deprived of the normal ability to judge correctly and tend to blindly follow a common belief of a group .  Some people obsessed with or under the spiritual control of Li Hongzhi 's " Scriptures " have cultivated a firm belief in Li Hongzhi 's fallacy of " elevation to Heaven " and have tended to go after a blind move made by a group like a flock of ducks .  
This bloody self-immolation further proved that " Falungong " is an out-and-out cult bearing all the characteristics of cults in the world , such as demanding absolute loyalty to the cult chief , fabricating antiscientific fallacies , exercising spiritual control over their followers , having mysterious and strict organization , being strongly exclusive and antisocial , irregularly spreading the " theory of world 's doomsday , " and creating the tragedy of " rise to heaven for full accomplishment . "  
The experts pointed out : For some time , the " Falungong " cult has created the worship of its founder , exercised spiritual control , concocted heresies , formed secret associations , accumulated wealth by unfair or illegal means , inflicted mortal injuries on human lives , and trampled on human rights .  These are acts in serious violation of the relevant Chinese laws .  
As a cultural system , each religion has drawn on the numerous spiritual assets created in the history of human civilization to become an important part of traditional culture and a way of life for its believers .  Religion has become a stabilizing force in society , playing a unique role in coordinating or balancing various spheres of activity in society .  
Since the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , tremendous achievements that attracted worldwide attention have been scored in China in reform , opening up , and the drive for modernization , the building of democratic legal system and spiritual civilization have been distinctly intensified , the citizens ' awareness in democratic legal system and quality of ideology and morality have been constantly elevated , and gratifying changes have taken place in social ethics and habits .  
Along with the development of the socialist market economy , the law governing the exchange of commodities will easily produce corrosive influences in social political life and people 's spiritual realm , give rise to the disregard of moral principles in pursuit of profits and the exchange of power for money , and lead to the weakening of the state and collective awareness and the spirit of mutual assistance and dedication .  
In our struggle against the " Falungong " cult , we conscientiously implemented the spirit of a series of instructions from the party center , gave full play to the advantage of ideological and political work , and offered all-dimensional help and education .  We managed to transform an overwhelming majority of those who practiced " Falungong " and , in particular , helped 43 fanatic followers of " Falungong " free themselves from their spiritual shackles .  
Some awakened " Falungong " followers expressed their belief that " now that we are rid of Li Hongzhi 's spiritual yoke , we feel very relaxed , and feel that life is so beautiful , leaders at every level are so amiable and respectful , the Party and the government are so great and right . "  
Li Lanqing said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , as China 's building of socialist spiritual civilization was further strengthened , the literary and artistic undertaking was flourishing in all fields , and the good athletes obtained excellent achievements in some major international games .  
Li Lanqing called for the governments at all levels to highly value the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking , regard it as a major component of the building of socialist spiritual civilization , increase the intensity of financial input , and give correct guidance to further advance the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking .  
Under the conditions of a socialist market economy , carrying forward and developing the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation , giving rise to a sound common practice of respecting , providing for , assisting the elderly in society , and building up a harmonious relationship between different generations is a major content for our current socialist spiritual civilization building .  
It is important to bring into play the roles of the elderly ; and according to the principle of integrating voluntary participation with one 's actual ability and integrating the demands of the society with one 's personal interests , the elderly should be encouraged to participate in activities of educating the younger generation , passing on scientific and cultural knowledge , providing consulting services , and taking part in social welfare undertakings and in the spiritual civilization building of their communities .  
They should seriously implement the important " three represents " thinking , devote more efforts to political construction , and unswervingly arm their minds with Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the series of important theses by President Jiang so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation , consolidate the spiritual pillar , and build a strong mental defense line .  
and great achievements have been made in the construction of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization .  This is a result of the efforts that Sichuan and Yunnan provincial party committees and provincial governments have made in leading the broad ranks of cadres and masses all over the two provinces to work hard , but live plainly , and forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit .  
Promoting comprehensive economic and social development , properly building the material and spiritual civilizations , making efforts to promote the coordinated development of the urban and rural areas and of different regions , keeping economic development , population , resources , and the environment in line , and bringing about sustainable economic and social development are the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , are important expression of our party 's " three represents " thinking , and are also the direction for the process of socialist modernization which we must firmly grasp .  
We must persistently take economic construction as the center , build a high degree of material and spiritual civilizations , speed up the comprehensive progress of various social undertakings , and strive to satisfy the people 's increasing material and cultural needs .  
29 .  In chapter 20 of " enhancing ideological and ethical education and of building a common ideological and spiritual support , " " particularly enhance ideological , political , ethical quality , and legal system education among youngsters " was revised to " particularly enhance ideological , political , ethical quality , psychological health , and legal system education among youngsters . "  
We will not merely stay at the growth of per capita income but , more importantly , make efforts in numerous areas including the consumption structure , living environment , social security , public services , medical treatment and healthcare , spiritual demands , and so on so that the material , spiritual , and cultural demands of the vast number of people are satisfied as much as possible , and their quality in life is improved .  
Second , it is necessary to link such activities with the promotion of spiritual civilization in rural areas , to heighten in an all-round way the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the masses of cadres and people in rural areas , and to provide economic and social development in rural areas with an ideological guarantee , spiritual motive force , and intellectual support .  
Mixing skylines from both cities form an imaginary chart .  The " City Cookie " goes one step further to allow people to have a bite of this crispy sky , and the " Sky-Eaters " will then experience how to make the impossible possible .  For Ho Siu-kee , the locus of cultural and spiritual identity is situated within one 's own bodies .  At the site of the body , knowledge of the world may be tested and even elaborated into myths .  
" It is no longer true that all Hong Kong people are too wrapped up in making money to pay heed and appreciate their heritage .  Perhaps a majority of them still does but a significant minority is demanding spiritual sustenance from Hong Kong 's rich heritage , be it archeological relics , historical buildings , traditional and cultural practices and all manners of antiquities .  
Apart from foreign debts , many communist ideologues find other reasons to oppose the current liberal policies . Some deplore the presence of " spiritual pollution " , seeing a growing materialism among mainland Chinese . Others view foreign investment as pure and simple exploitation of cheap labor , with the special treatment afforded to foreign firms and their workers inimical to the spirit of equality that communism was supposed to bring .  
What we are concerned about today is how , during the process of our society 's transformation and while our citizens pursue their economic lives , we can uphold our traditional ethical , spiritual , and moral concepts and fuse this into a harmonious and modern industrial society .  
Architects and scholars generally agree that traditional architecture had three special characteristics . First , from a structural perspective , the brackets piled layer by layer to support the eaves and the graceful sweep of the roof created a sense of fullness and lightness . Second , the strict attention paid to etiquette and the comprehensive ethical system of traditional society engendered a respect for balance and uprightness . Third , from a spiritual standpoint , the ancient Chinese cosmic order of yin and yang helped produce a feeling for the use of space .  
Master Sheng-yen has two explanations for the turnabout . First , at a time when contemporary man 's living space grows ever smaller and social tensions ever greater , Buddhism offers people explanations for the flux around them and a limitless spiritual space to roam in . And second , as people rise in educational level , they gain a new understanding of Buddhism which they find more acceptable .  
Along with the growth in Taiwan 's economy , a rise in the general level of culture , and an increase in international contacts , many local Chinese have come to appreciate the charm of Chinese-style furniture from foreign friends , while others , having enjoyed all the products of Western civilization , have simply stopped to ask themselves : When even our last spiritual stronghold - - the home - - has become completely Westernized , is there anything left that 's special about being Chinese ?  
Without the benefit of modern architectural planning or impressive stylish theories , one or several anonymous Chinese craftsmen centuries ago fashioned the vital lines , the public spaces , and the spiritual corners of this beautiful little village .  
This has received attention because : ( a ) The proportion of the elderly in the population has increased ; they hope to continue to study and fill out their lives . ( b ) People demand satisfaction in their spiritual lives as the standard of living rises . ( c ) Constant technological change requires opportunities for continuing education .  
The painstaking process of raising them , in which expense is no object , would be inconceivable in ordinary hog raising , which is aimed at economic efficiency , but religious or spiritual values can never be measured in terms of economic efficiency .  
The attention of our people will gradually shift from the enjoyment of things and material well-being to the more refined and spiritual side of life , and people will stress quality rather than quantity . More emphasis will be put on enjoying life , on sampling quality products , on moving into the more rarefied atmosphere of high-class and well-designed living quarters , at the same time reaching into the top echelons of fashion - - all within the ethos of traditional Chinese culture .  
The prince grew up in a royal court surrounded by wealth , pleasure and power . But under his father 's close protection he discovered that no matter how wealthy or powerful a man may be , he can not escape suffering old age and death . He then decided to abandon his wife , family and princely status , and cultivate the spiritual path .  
As a result , starting with cinnabar elixirs and mystical techniques designed to ensure immortality , Taoism in due course assimilated the spiritual exercises of Zen Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism . As it transformed itself into a widespread popular belief it thus became an integral part of the lives of the common folk . (  
At the same time , the government should also thoroughly implement ecological protection and prevention of public hazards , while improving traffic , public safety , and living environment conditions . In this way the people will not only have access to plentiful resources for their everyday life , but will also enjoy a rich and meaningful spiritual life , thus thoroughly realizing the ideals of prosperity and equitable distribution of wealth as prescribed in our Principle of the People 's Well-Being .  
Confucian propriety constrained people 's unfettered nature and maintained harmonious social relations ; Taoism 's unworldliness let people free themselves from material temptations , emphasized the aesthetic side of life , and allowed people to find spiritual satisfaction beyond material things through the contemplation of nature .  
Modern Taiwan 's rural hinterland could hardly be expected to provide ethical regeneration and social harmony as it used to in the past , because concentration of the population in cities is already an established trend . But rural culture 's essential spiritual values can provide the basis for cultural development .  
Our middle class is constantly expanding , and these people have an excellent educational level and potential as opinion-formers . Once they become aware of the importance of regenerating spiritual values in our civilization , I believe balanced social development will be within our grasp .  
After all , perhaps , lay people 's belief in Buddhism and Buddhist worship may stem from a worldly viewpoint of bringing them tangible success . They seek support from the bodhisattvas ' spiritual power to guard them against evil , but they fail to cultivate inner awareness or attain the inner tranquility and joy that come from dispelling selfish attachments and external concerns about fortune or misfortune . In contrast to Manjusri with his metaphysical ideas of prajna wisdom , Samantabhadra and his message of " great action " exemplifies a much more concrete aspect of Buddhism .  
Originating as country farmhouses alongside tire hot springs , rustic chicken restaurants may look spartan but they offer spiritual re lease for the permanent city dweller , added to which their " free-range chicken " signs seem to offer the tempting opportunity to enjoy a rare pleasure at little cost .  
Today , agricultural villages are in a period of transition . The elderly are not accustomed to living with their children in the crowded cities , and they 're unwilling to live in old folk 's homes . If old trees and the environments around them can be preserved , the villages can remain semi-agricultural , the elderly will have places to go , and their spiritual needs will be taken care of , too .  
As far back as the time of the prehistoric matriarchal society , the primitive people living in the Yellow River valley had begun to keep dogs . Dogs were the first domestic animals to be reared by humans , and were not only intimately involved in people 's daily lives on a prac tical level , but were also an indispensable part of life on the spiritual plane .  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
Perhaps a philosophy of life and death can be free from objectivity , formality , and rigidity , but it has the opposite critical problem of becoming personalized , and freely verified only in one 's own mind , so it is impossible to come to a common spiritual consensus .  
Yet except for the moslems of Arabia who found a spiritual meaning in their abnormal state and treated them as spiritually blessed , most societies have traditionally viewed them as the cursed , bodies deserted by their spirits , violators of sacred laws , or people possessed by the devil - - even incarnations of the devil himself . They have faced brutal punishments , such as death by burning .  
After he returned to Japan , Ho 's worsening stomach ailment forced him to undergo surgery . The healing process was torturous , and to make matters worse , the Second World War had broken out . Under the pall of such physical and spiritual pain , the painter put down his brush . His brush had stopped , but he remained alive at heart .  
Again , Xue Baocha should have made an ideal wife for the son of a family of high standing , but because she is unable to communicate with Jia Baoyu on a spiritual level , although she gains social rank , she finds no sympathetic resonance , but instead only a cold , empty shell .  
Sogyal Rinpoche is the spiritual heir of an ancient lineage of teachers reaching back several centuries . But he has lived for many years amidst modern society , which is rich in material assets , but whose people are confused and perplexed . In his eyes , most people misuse life and misunderstand death : " Death in fact is a great opportunity . Only when we understand death can we know how to live . "  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
Wang Chen-tai notes that early on there were factional conflicts , reducing the religion 's impact . Fortunately , he says , learned elders like Hsieh Sung-tao and Ting Chung-ming wrote inexhaustibly . Also , because of the importance of diplomatic ties with Islamic countries , the ROC government has strongly supported Muslims . The Taipei mosque , which has been the main spiritual and practical resource for Muslims in Taiwan for many years now , was built with government money in response to strong and far-sighted efforts by Ambassador Yeh Kung-chao .  
Another judge , Huang Hai-ming , adds that the five artists selected reveal three cultural phenomena : the prospering global economy and information explosion that brought with them the crises of spiritual fragmentation and loss of self-identity ( Wang Jun-jieh ) , political and social criticism that followed the lifting of martial law ( Wu Tien-chang and Yao Jui-chung ) , and finally " a return to the feelings of the heart and the oriental tradition " ( Lee Ming-tse and Chen Chien-pei ) .  
The reason dZi beads have been connected to living Buddhas in Taiwan is that many believers take them to Buddhist masters to be " invested with spiritual power . " When Namgyal must tell people that what they supposed was a valuable old dZi bead is just a well-crafted reproduction , even he cushions the blow by saying that they can always ask a master to invest it with spiritual power so that it will become just as effective as a true old dZi bead .  
Extrapolating further , Ma says that overemphasis on knowledge and science means people lack the appropriate mental tools to help them understand their inner life . Thus , as material culture becomes more and more advanced and knowledge becomes more and more objective , we become more and more deficient in spiritual cultivation , and our moral character is more and more debased .  
He continues : " Actually he was talking about things on the spiritual plane , but who 'd have thought that so soon afterwards Puli would be left in such an appalling state by an earthquake , as if it really was sunk . So we all joked that he has ' second sight . ' " " In fact he had been extremely despondent , and that 's why he was eager to turn from mere thinking and observation to action , by doing some concrete community work .  
You can find as succinct a description of Zhu Xi 's importance as any in the Taiwan middle-school textbook History of Chinese Culture , which notes that Zhu Xi spent a lifetime annotating the Confucian classics , and established his own academies to teach others . It declaims : " You could say that , prior to the ascendance of Western power , Zhu Xi had the greatest influence on East Asian civilization of any one individual . His spirit permeated the daily lives , outlooks , and spiritual inclinations of Chinese people . "  
Huang Min-nan , who formerly headed pop music planning at Rock Records , says : " Buddhist music now changes several times a year . " Not so long ago Chinese-style symphonic music , or chanting accompanied by a single instrument was popular , but at the moment it 's all about " spiritual " music and dance tunes .  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
With modern science taking steps toward the spiritual world , " Taiwan is naturally best situated to take a world-leading role in this work . " Lee Si-chen points out that both Taoism and Buddhism have unique views about the operations of the universe . Furthermore , the Chinese in Taiwan have inherited from their ancestors both the active practice of qigong ( the movement of internal energy ) and the reflective practice of meditation . Research into these has been extensive , to a degree unimaginable in the West .  
Happy , because in the past century Taiwan has not directly experienced a major war , its economy and society have advanced steadily , and our living environment has continuously improved . Today 's Taipei is like any international city-modern and convenient , with most everything one needs in terms of daytime activities , nightlife , and material and spiritual culture .  
" Modern people are most easily swayed by things that are framed conceptually , so intuitive spiritual methods have to be packaged in rational terms to make them more acceptable . The new mode of ' spiritual cultivation ' is something that satisfies the demands of modern urbanites , " avers Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University .  
A lot of people in my business have also attended these spiritual growth classes , hoping to break through their personal difficulties , have more harmonious personal relationships , and progress to a higher level at work , " says Chen Tsu-yin . Chen recently entered the insurance business , and this year , despite her great terror about meeting people , won the annual best individual achievement prize given by her company 's customer service department .  
5 . Pay attention to the theoretical system underlying a spiritual cultivation method : As well as the theory itself , also observe whether this theoretical system links in with secular systems of knowledge . Excessive rejection of other ideas is usually a sign that something is amiss , but excessive tolerance or an attitude that anything goes is also too undiscerning .  
Ideally , this brief journey through the MWR should allow visitors to transcend the noise of ordinary existence and reflect on the meaning of life , and then return to aspects of concrete existence in the Avatamsaka World . It 's like a spiritual sauna . Or , like a pilgrimage to the great cities of the ancient world , for modern people this is a relaxing and enriching education . Unfortunately , construction of the Internet part of the Avatamsaka World is still ongoing .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
The Cultural Bureau of Taichung County last year organized the teachers ' pilgrimage group so as to disseminate understanding of the religious meaning of the pilgrimage and its transforming spiritual power . This year it added groups of volunteers who explained the cultural and historical significance of the festival and recounted their personal experiences with the majesty and power of the tradition .  
Frank , like James , was born in China , and had a deep emotional attachment to the country . He found it hard to understand and accept the tragic circumstances that befell Asia and was filled with inner spiritual turmoil . In 1946 , at the age of 26 , at a US military base near Hiroshima , Japan , he shot himself .  
" But when they reached middle age , and their material dreams were satisfied , they felt spiritual emptiness , as a result of which many turned to dissipated lifestyles , extramarital affairs , and religious escapism , " says Wang Chung-kwei , chairman of the Department of Psychology at Soochow University , who is a long-time student of generational differences in Taiwan . This is one reason why spiritual and religious topics have garnered so much attention in Taiwan in recent years .  
Asked what areas of personal concern they feel they most need to address , respondents answered , in order of priority : job skills or professional abilities and knowledge ( 30.1% ) ; personal economic or financial situation ( 21.5% ) ; foreign language ability ( 11.2% ) ; level of academic achievement ( 9.6% ) ; quality of life or place of residence ( 5.2% ) ; and religious or spiritual growth ( 2.6% ) .  
The changing face of the Yushan area at the hands of human beings over the last hundred years is quite clear . Although since the Japanese occupation Yushan has satisfied the so-called spiritual needs and intellectual inquiries of scholars from various disciplines , this has generally been for the one-sided benefit of mankind , done with a specific purpose in mind . And this includes the so-called " spirit of Yushan " today , which is a product of mankind 's subjective emotional projection .  
From Great Giving Hall , where the medical school is located , one can look west to the verdant Central Mountain Range , east to hanging gardens replete with flowers and trees , and north to Still Thoughts Hall , the spiritual symbol of the Tzu Chi Foundation .  
Master Hong Yi himself can be considered the first person to have introduced Western aesthetics to China . He was not only thoroughly familiar with the principles and sensibilities behind Western painting , drama , and music , but had a similarly profound understanding of Chinese poetry , painting , and calligraphy . Finally , however , he relinquished these worldly means of creating beauty , and took the vows of a monk , living in a monastery where he pursued another world of beauty through spiritual enlightenment .  
The second is the formation of the political , economic , social , spiritual and cultural life of the State , without the infamous system - inherited from the past - of roles played out in advance .  
Activities that are dangerous or harmful to the child 's harmonious physical , mental and spiritual development or are liable to jeopardize the future education and training of the child ;

Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live ,  
Our Government , headed by His Excellency Joaqu \ x { 74af } Balaguer , and the people that I represent join in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , and share the hope that the Organization 's efforts and successes will continue to increase in the continuing search for a just , united , common and fraternal humanity , sharing the material and spiritual assets of a civilization that can lead us to see people as part of a common humanity .  
Notwithstanding the impressive achievements of the human race we are forced to live at the same time with unspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritual progress in which we might feel some pride as we approach the new century .  
The general objectives of protecting vulnerable groups are to ensure that all such individuals should be allowed to develop to their full potential ( including healthy physical , mental and spiritual development ) ; to ensure that young people can develop , establish and maintain healthy lives ; to allow women to perform their key role in society ; and to support indigenous people through educational , economic and technical opportunities .  
We , Heads of State and Government , are committed to a political , economic , ethical and spiritual vision for social development based on human dignity , human rights , equality , respect , peace , democracy , mutual responsibility and cooperation , and full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people .  
Preparation of the entire population for the later stages of life should be an integral part of social policies and encompass physical , psychological , cultural , religious , spiritual , economic , health and other factors " ( International Plan of Action on Ageing , para . 25 ( i ) ) .

In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .

Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development .
