Mr Tong admitted that the unwavering stance taken to protect the peg had brought about short term problems , such as increases in interest rates , but with a solid economic foundation , a huge fiscal reserve and a sound financial and monitoring system , Hong Kong is confident that it will be among the first - - if not the first - - to rebound .  
Mr Tong admitted that the unwavering stance taken to protect the peg had brought about short term problems , such as increases in interest rates , but with a solid economic foundation , a huge fiscal reserve and a sound financial and monitoring system , Hong Kong is confident that it will be among the first - if not the first - to rebound . 
We have a free and open economy ; excellent regulatory systems ; huge fiscal and foreign reserves ; tried , tested and successful fiscal policies ; level playing field for all who do business here ; a vigorous anti-corruption commission ; a versatile and flexible workforce ; and world class infrastructure and communication .  
Indeed , Hong Kong has run into unprecedented problems .  Yet we also enjoy today a number of advantages , such as huge fiscal reserves , prudent financial management policies , a sound monetary system , strong development on the mainland as our backup and a high degree of autonomy , which we have never had before .  
However , with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Hong Kong people , expanding economy of the Mainland together with the traditional prudent financial management , sound banking system , huge foreign exchange reserve that support a stable exchange rate , we continue to look forward to our future with confidence .  
In consideration of the huge demand of the elderly for services of care and attention homes , the Government pledged , in the Policy Address last year , to allocate substantial resources to increase the supply of residential care places .  An additional 3 300 places in subvented residential care homes and 1 400 places in subvented nursing homes will be provided between 1998 and 2002 .  Besides , the number of bought places in private residential care homes will be increased by 2 400 from 1998 to 2001 .  
He called for new rules and strategies to cope with the huge inflows and outflows of capital that are part and parcel of today 's global trading and investment environment as well as a new set of international guidelines to facilitate smooth , sustainable growth rather than boom and bust cycles .  
He stressed that Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals were very strong , and together with its huge foreign currency reserves , a stable currency , and excellent financial and banking systems , the territory 's recovery from the downturn would be amongst the first in the region . 
More importantly , Hong Kong 's edge over the other East Asian economies has been underpinned by a host of other factors , such as a good quality labour force , a low and simple taxation system , a stable government , a corruption free society , an efficient transport and telecommunications infrastructure , sound legal and regulatory systems , free flow of information , and most important of all , a huge and rapidly growing hinterland just to the north of Hong Kong , " Mr Tsang said .  
" Hong Kong , with its huge cargo base , comprehensive and efficient links with the Mainland and the outside world , and excellent supporting services , is ideally located to organise the logistics for the numerous manufacturing plants and factories in the Pearl River Delta and the region .  
Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals remain strong .  These include , inter alia , the Mainland as our economic hinterland , robust financial and banking systems , a huge foreign exchange reserve , a sound legal system , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a clean government and efficient transport and communications facilities .  All these factors contribute towards the maintenance of our competitiveness .  
In particular , the Government would like to hear views on the following : ( i ) how the Government can more effectively deploy and utilize the existing huge amount of public resources devoted to education ; ( ii ) a realistic timeframe to implement the various reform proposals and the practical difficulties affecting all or certain stakeholders ; ( iii ) the phasing of different reform proposals and their relative priorities .  
A spokesman for the Home Affairs Department ( HAD ) , which commissioned the dragon and organised the festival as part of the New Millennium celebrations , said : " We continued to receive requests from various quarters to extend the exhibition period despite the fact that exhibition of the dragon lantern has already been extended once .  But we would like to accommodate the popular demand as both the Lantern Festival and the giant dragon lantern are continuing to draw huge crowds . "  
" I believe that a deep and liquid regional market is one way that we can help alleviate the risks of sudden , erratic and sometimes huge international capital flows into and out of specific markets .  
Mr Lee explained that the pollution problems previously portrayed by the media only involved specific areas along Dongjiang which were localised and confined in nature and might not affect the overall quality of raw water transferred to Hong Kong . The water volume of the Dongjiang was huge , being measured in millions of cubic metres ( 1 cubic metre is 1,000 litres ) , which had a natural purification effect on the quality of Dongjiang water .  
The net outflow of financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of 2000 was characterised by a net outflow in direct investment due to increased investment by Hong Kong residents abroad , a shift to net outflow due to cash settlement of financial derivatives , and a continued though reduced net outflow in other investment , but a continued huge net inflow in portfolio investment .  
Against the continued sizeable surplus in the current account , this reversal in BoP position was mostly due to a switch to net outflow in financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of this year , having recorded a huge net inflow in the preceding quarter .  
He added that Hong Kong 's strong economic fundamentals were supported by its prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems and stable economic development of the Mainland .  
He added that HK 's strong economic fundamentals were supported by its prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems and stable economic development of the Mainland .  
He added that Hong Kong 's strong economic fundamentals , prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , and sound financial regulatory systems merit higher ratings for Hong Kong .  
" The growing demand for soccer betting is now being satisfied through illegal and unauthorized means , thus leaving the local and offshore soccer bookmakers a huge market to serve .  
" However , we consider that Hong Kong merits a higher rating , in view of our strong economic fundamentals which are supported by prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems , and stable economic development of the Mainland , " the spokesman said .  
Speaking at the Hong Kong Business Seminar in Osaka , Miss Cheung said Hong Kong 's unique advantages for Japanese businesses intending to make their inroads into the huge China market included its financial and legal services , port and airport facilities , high quality professionals with excellent knowledge of doing business in China and their extensive network of contacts .  
This will create huge room for development for Hong Kong 's enterprises .  With our many unique advantages , such as the rule of law , a low tax rate , a clean government , a solid financial system , the free flow of capital and information , and a wealth of knowledge about the Mainland and international markets , Hong Kong will be able to contribute to the further development of the Mainland and , in the process , find new impetus of growth for our own economy .  
In the contrary , the Han emperors had in the early years of their governance implemented the " Rehabilitation Policy " , which resulted in a more stable society with wealth and strength .  These account for the restful and graceful facial expressions of the Han pottery figurines as well as the huge number of pottery animals , which demonstrate the affluence and social stability of the period .  
At a joint meeting of Legislative Council 's Panel on Planning , Lands and Works and Panel on Environmental Affairs this ( October 13 ) afternoon , some members expressed that the Government and its legal representatives had led the court to believe that reclamation was not irreversible and the Government would suffer huge financial losses if the court ordered the work be stopped pending the outcome of a judicial review .  
The national anthem was played and some 200,000 people , including 20,000 overseas Chinese and 400 foreign diplomats and visitors , stood at attention . The huge military parade then started , following a report given by Lt . Gen . Chiang Chung-ling , commanding officer of the parade , on the number of personnel and units involved .  
Still farther ahead are the large Yangming waterfall , often illuminated on sunny days by a cascades of light shining through crevices in huge rocks and cliffs , and adorned with many pavilions .  
It is the most southerly point on Taiwan , and is the site of a towering white lighthouse known as the " Light of East Asia " , standing 18 meters tall . Some say that on a clear day , the northern islands of the neighbouring Philippine archipelago can be seen across the waters of the Bashi channel . From one perspective , Maobitou and Oluanbi can be seen as the claws of a huge crab cradling a long , broken strip of fine sand beaches .  
Beginning with that term , the grand prize announced during the Chinese New Year rose from a previous US $ 600000 to the alluring sum of US $ 3,750,000 . The possibility of winning a huge sum of money with a mere US $ 2.50 ( 100 NTD ) ticket makes it easy to understand the lottery 's popularity .  
The narcissus dish pictured here , when observed from the front , stares directly at you with its two large eyes , while its pair of massive pincers serve as the supporting feet of the vessel . It seems as though the narcissus is growing on the body of the crab , making quite an interesting picture , much like the ancient legend of the mountain of the immortals upon the sea , which rested on the back of a huge tortoise .  
In the old section you 'll see students from Heidelberg University wearing thick coats and carrying bundles of books . They brave the cold December winds as they walk through the market district , which sells Italian leather , French perfumes , and mink coats . Then they take a sharp turn into a small red brick alley to a seventeenth century Gothic style building . Just behind the huge wooden doors the professor is getting ready for class .  
And if you make windfall profits on speculation , then that 's just smart planning . " But the two main public policies for returning price rises to the public - - buying land up according to assessed value and taxes , also based on assessed value - - are not able to fulfill their function because of the huge gap between the standard - - assessed prices - - and the actual market prices .  
Following Taiwan 's economic development , with a huge trade surplus , vast foreign exchange reserves , and a per capita income of US $ 8,000 , Taiwan 's economic strength was visible everywhere , and had become adequate to bear the costs of buying " intellectual property . "  
Three hundred years ago , colonial powers including England and Holland , looking to develop the rubber plantations and tin mines of southeast Asia , sought workers among the densely packed , poverty-stricken Chinese populations of Fukien and Kwangtung along the southeast coast of China . This created a huge wave of economic migration .  
It 's a new field , developed only five or six years ago , where we are n't that far behind other countries and where there are wide prospects for future applications . Although some scholars are worried they wo n't fit in with other industries , " high-temperature superconductors do n't require a huge investment , and as long as we keep at it , there 's a good chance we can hold our own with any other country , " Hsu Shiang-kueen says .  
The rise in TB in the U . S . is probably related to the huge increase in AIDS , " says Lin Tao-ping , director of the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau . Once their immune system breaks down , AIDS sufferers are defenseless against communicable diseases . Twenty to 30 percent of them contract tuberculosis , especially atypical forms of the bacillus that ordinary people are not readily susceptible to and which are highly resistant to medication .  
Motorcyclists inhaling carcinogens behind buses , children breathing in particulates that cause respiratory and skin ailments , drivers growing drowsy from carbon monoxide . . . the damage to human health is a huge invisible social cost .  
Head librarian Wu Wen-chin says : " The work of the library is comprehensive . When we arranged all our common Chinese and Japanese books , we edited a catalog of 72 volumes , which was a huge process that was only finished eight years ago . After that we began an automatic system , which requires a very big budget . "  
It is just that if you look at metals such as gold and iron , the former is extremely rare and inert and can not easily undergo chemical changes through combining with other materials , while the latter is used in huge quantities but is actually needed by the human body - - medics even recommend that we use iron cooking pots so as to provide us with supplementary iron .  
Chen Hui-sheng says that there are some people raising huge eagles or vultures smuggled in from abroad . Yet Taiwan 's suburbs lack rabbits or foxes or other larger types of prey . " It 's like bombing a chicken with napalm , " says the well-informed Chen . Wide-wingspread falcons are extremely fast , and require a huge amount of space , and are completely unsuitable for mountainous Taiwan .  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
The more powerful the backwave , the faster the base will be washed away . Given this vicious cycle , both dikes made of steel reinforced concrete or " breakwaters " made up of huge concrete tetrapods dropped into the ocean off the coast are both are basically weak structures that require continual repair . Dikes must be periodically raised and new concrete tetrapods laid down .  
Drinks prepared at bubble tea shops start with simple red or green tea . " It 's not very expensive , and you can drink a huge glass for half the price of a cup of coffee , and even spend several hours hanging out , " says a middle school student who often does just that with her classmates after the school bell rings .  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
In the past , prehistoric civilization " . . . generally revolved around Lungshan and Yangshao , " says Wang Mingda , research assistant at the Archaeological Institute of Zhejiang Province . Most people believe that the origin and center of civilization was in North China . After the excavation of huge numbers of artifacts of the Liangzhu , it was established that the Yangtze river valley , like the Yellow river valley , also held " a very glorious and splendid culture . "  
If the subject is limited to manufacturing technology , then Taiwan companies have no huge advantage . Fortunately technology is just one element in commercial competition . Mainland manufacturers still offer too few styles , and use outdated materials . They are not like Taiwan firms , which can afford to bring in superior , more durable materials from abroad .  
In the dark , researchers can only remain inland , observing the seashore at a long distance , watching the turtles crawl ashore like huge ambulant rocks . The green turtles dig their holes in slow motion , and concentrate on laying eggs . Only at this stage , when nothing will distract their attention , can researchers take advantage of this time to take measurements of the sea turtles and the length and width of the hole , make labels and establish a basic data base .  
Shen Hsiu-mei has a child studying in the experimental class at the Yungho Primary School . The class emphasizes a lively , upbeat education . The instructors are n't too worried about teaching the children a huge amount of new characters , nor do they use standardized test papers . Compared to the parents of children in the regular classes , Shen is not suffering anxiety over whether or not her child is learning too slowly . "  
The sound of gongs and drums gets nearer and nearer . We pass through a narrow lane , and a vision suddenly appears before our eyes , reflected in the light of fire - - a huge procession of people and horses . Some folks carry incense ; others are striking large gongs . Some are bearing little palanquins in which are seated statues of the village gods ; they excitedly crowd around Matsu 's seat of honor as it moves its way forward .  
For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu . The Wild Bird Society invited candidates from all three major parties to take part in the huge gathering . Of course , the harvest was bountiful - - at the event all three parties ' candidates promised once elected to build a nature preserve in Kuantu .  
As these five ports were all close to the teagrowing areas of southern China , the supply of tea became abundant and uninterrupted , and after the Treaty of Nanking the huge stocks of tea held in London 's warehouses expanded so much as to become a worrisome burden .  
Another example is monitoring of changes in forested areas . Keeping up with destructive exploitation or natural disasters ( like forest fires ) by using traditional survey techniques is time-consuming yet not timely , because of the huge extent and frequent inaccessibility of forested land ( which is often concentrated in remote mountain areas with no roads ) . Satellite surveys , on the other hand , cover huge areas and can be collected regularly , making them an invaluable tool .  
In the US , for example , residential and agricultural areas are clearly separate , and huge areas of agricultural land are often devoted to a single crop , so it is easy to differentiate the objects in the satellite image .  
" Multi-cinema theater houses are the trend of the future . Big theaters are only a promotional gimmick , the attraction of a huge screen , " says Robert Chen , associate professor of communication arts at Fujen Catholic University . During the 100-year development of the movie , it has evolved from an art form into a small-group social activity . It is easy to comprehend why empty echoes are often heard in the larger cinemas .  
It has spent a great amount of funds on a few species like the Formosan landlocked salmon and the Formosan sika , but concern for the maroon oriole and other species is conspicuously absent . A huge quantity of cash is spent on rebuilding sika deer numbers , but the southern cross-island highway will be allowed to divide the Mt . Tawu clouded leopard nature preserve .  
Sixty years later , opium was being sold in huge quantities , and the tottering Qing dynasty , ruling an increasingly impoverished and decadent populace , could stand it no more : They decided to strictly ban opium , and burned existing stocks . The result was the Opium War , which launched a century of national humiliation for China .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
Fiddler crabs of the species Uca borealis have an unusual choice of habitat : they live on muddy sandflats . Though their huge claws are beautifully colored and impressively shaped , they are not very mobile , so it seems they are there just for show - - to scare others off - - and not do any harm .  
However , the Japanese scholar " did not have any commercial interest , but on the contrary brought respect and affirmation to aboriginal culture . But the fact that Enigma earned huge profits from record sales-the album with Difag 's singing on it sold five million copies-has caused virtually everyone in Taiwan to think only in terms of what profit there is to be had . This seems to reflect some special feature of Taiwan 's culture , " Ming says , his voice tinged with regret . Return to innocence  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
Looking at the past , the last wave of stock fever-with its tidal wave cresting past the 10,000 mark , then falling with devastating force-ended up in a massive redistribution of wealth in Taiwan . When the market is unhealthy , it can be manipulated , and naturally the rich ended up richer and the poor , poorer . Moreover , the huge financial losses of the last cycle disrupted countless families and bankrupted many businesses .  
Just as botanists describe , on the most inhospitable mountaintops , amid powerful winds , biting frosts and heavy snow , on dry , infertile soil where conditions are too harsh even for the Formosan cypress and Hinoki cypress which otherwise grow to such huge size , Taiwan 's Yu-shan rhododendron ( R . pseudochrys-anthum ) shrugs off the unrelenting onslaught of the elements and grows in thick clumps everywhere , changing the color of the mountain forests and grassland .  
Western classical music is the furthest removed from life ; such a huge orchestra can not possibly be heard in ordinary life . But nobody ever asks questions about " the modern life of Western classical music . " The equipment of Western wind and string instrumental music is a form belonging to more than a century ago , but nobody ever wonders why orchestras do n't modernize .  
Because Kaohsiung harbor has a huge capacity , and is a pivotal spot for routes to southeast Asia , in the Japanese occupation era the authorities made it a concentration point for heavy industry and petroleum refining . After the outbreak of the war in the Pacific , Japan used Kaohsiung as a base for advancing southward , and established many military facilities there .  
What 's really depressing about this highway is the desolate vista presented by the heavy industry lining both sides . Whatever kind of grey and ugly industrial form you can think of-concrete factories , petroleum refineries , rusting old oil drums , discarded tire dumps , corrugated-steel structures put up without regard to building codes , construction machinery parks , steel smelters , chemical companies , oil pipeline , huge storage towers-they are all here . There 's only one thing you ca n't find , in fact : a tall green tree .  
In one of the Dunhuang Caves , you can find yourself surrounded on four sides by the petals of a giant lotus decoration , in which one peaceful Buddha after another sits in front of its own huge lotus petal . Since lotus petals and leaves have unusual shapes , you can always tell when a lotus flower is being depicted no matter if it has been stretched long , pressed flat , or molded into a square .  
What private sector publishing firms originally set their sights on was the huge primary school textbook market , which consists of over 300,000 student readers . This , plus the possibility of publishing additional reference materials and teaching aids , adds up to potentially enormous profits . It is the main reason publishers were initally jumping at the chance to get in on the textbook market .  
Most SREs are involved in activities intimately related to daily life , and are the foundation for national economic development . They may well be making huge surpluses-last year Chunghwa Telecom took in NT $ 49 billion in profits , CPC and Taipower more than NT $ 10 billion each-but that does n't mean they have been efficient . They have many shortcomings compared to similar service-providers abroad .  
" The strong prey on the weak , the old consume the young , " sighs one telecom company manager . Early on , the DGT earned huge profits with its exorbitant mobile phone charges ; it was this fat market that private firms yearned for .  
The main source of purchased ships and naval weaponry has always been the US . But the US , which has a global strategy and huge forces , has designed its ships to specialize in specific missions like air defense or ASW . For the ROC navy , which has far fewer ships and a smaller area of responsibility , highly specialized craft are not necessarily suitable . That is to say , even if Taiwan can procure US ships , it may be necessary to refit or supplement the weaponry .  
When we come to the Mennonite Christian Hospital in early December , a huge Christmas tree stands in the middle of the foyer of the newly completed hospital building . At the registration counter , in the consulting rooms , at the payment counter , at the pharmacy and even in the staff offices , everywhere is festooned with colored streamers , snowflakes and fairy lights . Instead of the cold , depressing atmosphere usually associated with hospitals , the place is full of the warm and festive spirit of Christmas .  
He no longer needed to punch a time-card or go to work . He no longer had a boss and was no longer controlled by anyone . Facing a huge expanse of unstructured time , he noticed : " I began to feel anxious , insecure and afraid . But all of these reactions forced me to become the master of my own life . "  
The economic basis of the Li clan 's livelihood had been laid down by Li Qingshui 's gradually buying up a huge area of farmland , but because the family suffered harassment from local tyrants , the seven brothers of the third generation decided to support the naturally gifted Li Shuhua , to allow him to devote himself completely to study . Shuhua really did pass the imperial examinations , and later became chief examining officer for the initial xiucai grade civil service exams for the whole of Taiwan .  
Recently natural wild plants have become popular foods in Taiwan , and aboriginal edible plants have become well-known in the process . However , edible plants account for only one-quarter of the plants used in daily life in Taniao village . Besides the necessities ( food , shelter , clothing ) , plants are essential materials for a huge number of other uses-medicine , landmarks , all kinds of tools used for outdoor work , rope , packaging , sandpaper , and cloth .  
Damiana is far from being an impressive plant . In the arid areas of the peninsula , which are dominated by huge columnar cacti and wide-canopied mesquite trees , its humble appearance may belie its importance for the local inhabitants . It is a small shrubby plant that grows in the dry soils of northern Mexico , Baja California and southern Texas .  
It was said that the plan was simply an effort to bail out the construction industry , and was not in the public interest . Reasons for this view included the huge amount of money involved , and the fact that the were no provisions to stop the rich or those who already owned homes from taking advantage of the special mortgage rate . In fact , anyone who wants to purchase a new home from a construction company is eligible for a low-interest mortgage to buy one .  
In a darkened room , masked bronze heads are laid out in two glowing sacrificial burial pits . Hanging on the wall is a huge photograph of the site where these treasures were recently unearthed after lying buried for thousands of years . In front of the photograph is a huge mask , its bug-eyes bulging out 16 cm from the sockets , staring straight at each modern-day visitor that enters through the time warp .  
Little did they know that just beneath their feet lay the buried remains of an ancient culture dating back to a period ranging from 2,800 to 4,800 years ago . After several decades of research , however , archeologists have brought to light spectacular proof of an ancient " Sanxingdui culture . " Relics have been unearthed at dozens of locations around the huge Sanxingdui site , which covers a total area of more than 15 square kilometers .  
Just as the archeologists were beginning to calm down after the discovery of pit # 1 , the adrenaline started pumping again . As before , the soil was rammed hard , and once again , one stunning item after another was unearthed-over 60 elephant tusks , numerous delicate and complex bronze zun and lei ( an urn-shaped wine vessel ) , bronze heads bedecked in a wide assortment of finery , and a huge bronze mask measuring over 130 cm from side to side .  
Now that the Sanxingdui exhibit has brought over a huge bronze statue of a man and many other exotic items , another blockbuster exhibit from the mainland has been scheduled for October . The autumn event will feature the superbly preserved silk paintings found at the Mawangdui site in Hunan Province as well as the stunning jade pieces discovered in Guangzhou at the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom . Going in the other direction , a private Taiwanese collection ( Ku Yue Ko ) was put on exhibit four years ago at the Palace Museum in Beijing .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry . But innovation requires huge quantities of financial and human resources dedicated to R &amp; D , with laboratories pursuing technological breakthroughs around the clock , and with professional investment managers able to turn innovative ideas into products and profits . "  
Many music industry insiders in both Taiwan and the mainland agree that her former producer , the late Chang Yu-sheng , played a huge role in A-Mei 's rise to stardom . In songs like " Sisters " and " Bad Boy , " Chang masterfully brought out the " feral intensity of this small-town aboriginal girl . " Chang used distinctive lyrics , catchy tunes , A-Mei 's unique image , and an effective PR strategy to great advantage . Xiao Ke points to another example of slick promotion in the Taiwanese pop music industry .  
That Liu Shao-tang 's death elicited such a huge response at a time when all of Taiwan 's media are packed with electoral news in the run-up to the March presidential ballot , is not only a measure of the widespread respect which Liu earned by his lifelong professionalism and refusal to lower standards , but also shows that Taiwan is still a place with deep feelings and concern for intellectual matters .  
All of these developments will have a huge impact on the future well-being of the human race , yet for many of us they are distant and unfamiliar . This is particularly true of genetic engineering , considered the biggest breakthrough in the life sciences since genetics and molecular biology . Man has begun to probe the very origins of life .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease-fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "  
The construction budget for the new terminal at CKS Airport , which opened in July , included a public art allocation of NT $ 100 million . Deciding how to handle this huge sum proved a difficult task for the project 's executive committee . Many people questioned whether public art has to be limited to the installation of permanent " works of art . "  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
The famous Tang dynasty physician Sun Simao spent huge sums of money to learn spells and charms from various sources . He admitted that these occult techniques were not especially desirable or palatable , nor did they have a compelling logic behind them , but , he added , they had proved more effective than he expected , and that is why he included them in his medical text Qian Jin Yi Fang .  
While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
The pair get married , but the Snake King arrives disguised as a local village girl and steals the magic feather . In the end , Wan Shi turns into a huge boulder to pin down the Snake King , while the egret goddess gives up her magic feather to save the island , which has been laid to waste . Thanks to the sacrifices of Wan Shi and the egret goddess , the people are able to live in peace once again .  
" Industrial firms in Taiwan have expanded capacity furiously over the past decade and produced in huge quantities . The result has been destructive price competition that has left producers badly weakened . " Central banks throughout the world have responded by lowering interest rates in an attempt to revive their economies . The US Federal Reserve Board has lowered the prime lending rate ten times this year , and Japan 's interest rates have been at zero for a long time , but rapidly declining investments have greatly reduced the effectiveness of such monetary measures .  
In recent years , every major meeting among industrialized nations having anything to do with economic globalization has been accompanied by rioting and protests . In particular , the huge riots in Seattle in 1999 have ignited a big upsurge in opposition to globalization .

They brave the cold December winds as they walk through the market district , which sells Italian leather , French perfumes , and mink coats . Then they take a sharp turn into a small red brick alley to a seventeenth century Gothic style building . Just behind the huge wooden doors the professor is getting ready for class .  
And if you make windfall profits on speculation , then that 's just smart planning . " But the two main public policies for returning price rises to the public - - buying land up according to assessed value and taxes , also based on assessed value - - are not able to fulfill their function because of the huge gap between the standard - - assessed prices - - and the actual market prices .  
Following Taiwan 's economic development , with a huge trade surplus , vast foreign exchange reserves , and a per capita income of US $ 8,000 , Taiwan 's economic strength was visible everywhere , and had become adequate to bear the costs of buying " intellectual property . "  
Three hundred years ago , colonial powers including England and Holland , looking to develop the rubber plantations and tin mines of southeast Asia , sought workers among the densely packed , poverty-stricken Chinese populations of Fukien and Kwangtung along the southeast coast of China . This created a huge wave of economic migration .  
It 's a new field , developed only five or six years ago , where we are n't that far behind other countries and where there are wide prospects for future applications . Although some scholars are worried they wo n't fit in with other industries , " high-temperature superconductors do n't require a huge investment , and as long as we keep at it , there 's a good chance we can hold our own with any other country , " Hsu Shiang-kueen says .  
The rise in TB in the U . S . is probably related to the huge increase in AIDS , " says Lin Tao-ping , director of the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau . Once their immune system breaks down , AIDS sufferers are defenseless against communicable diseases . Twenty to 30 percent of them contract tuberculosis , especially atypical forms of the bacillus that ordinary people are not readily susceptible to and which are highly resistant to medication .  
Motorcyclists inhaling carcinogens behind buses , children breathing in particulates that cause respiratory and skin ailments , drivers growing drowsy from carbon monoxide . . . the damage to human health is a huge invisible social cost .  
Head librarian Wu Wen-chin says : " The work of the library is comprehensive . When we arranged all our common Chinese and Japanese books , we edited a catalog of 72 volumes , which was a huge process that was only finished eight years ago . After that we began an automatic system , which requires a very big budget . "  
It is just that if you look at metals such as gold and iron , the former is extremely rare and inert and can not easily undergo chemical changes through combining with other materials , while the latter is used in huge quantities but is actually needed by the human body - - medics even recommend that we use iron cooking pots so as to provide us with supplementary iron .  
Chen Hui-sheng says that there are some people raising huge eagles or vultures smuggled in from abroad . Yet Taiwan 's suburbs lack rabbits or foxes or other larger types of prey . " It 's like bombing a chicken with napalm , " says the well-informed Chen . Wide-wingspread falcons are extremely fast , and require a huge amount of space , and are completely unsuitable for mountainous Taiwan .  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
The more powerful the backwave , the faster the base will be washed away . Given this vicious cycle , both dikes made of steel reinforced concrete or " breakwaters " made up of huge concrete tetrapods dropped into the ocean off the coast are both are basically weak structures that require continual repair . Dikes must be periodically raised and new concrete tetrapods laid down .  
Drinks prepared at bubble tea shops start with simple red or green tea . " It 's not very expensive , and you can drink a huge glass for half the price of a cup of coffee , and even spend several hours hanging out , " says a middle school student who often does just that with her classmates after the school bell rings .  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
In the past , prehistoric civilization " . . . generally revolved around Lungshan and Yangshao , " says Wang Mingda , research assistant at the Archaeological Institute of Zhejiang Province . Most people believe that the origin and center of civilization was in North China . After the excavation of huge numbers of artifacts of the Liangzhu , it was established that the Yangtze river valley , like the Yellow river valley , also held " a very glorious and splendid culture . "  
If the subject is limited to manufacturing technology , then Taiwan companies have no huge advantage . Fortunately technology is just one element in commercial competition . Mainland manufacturers still offer too few styles , and use outdated materials . They are not like Taiwan firms , which can afford to bring in superior , more durable materials from abroad .  
In the dark , researchers can only remain inland , observing the seashore at a long distance , watching the turtles crawl ashore like huge ambulant rocks . The green turtles dig their holes in slow motion , and concentrate on laying eggs . Only at this stage , when nothing will distract their attention , can researchers take advantage of this time to take measurements of the sea turtles and the length and width of the hole , make labels and establish a basic data base .  
Shen Hsiu-mei has a child studying in the experimental class at the Yungho Primary School . The class emphasizes a lively , upbeat education . The instructors are n't too worried about teaching the children a huge amount of new characters , nor do they use standardized test papers . Compared to the parents of children in the regular classes , Shen is not suffering anxiety over whether or not her child is learning too slowly . "  
The sound of gongs and drums gets nearer and nearer . We pass through a narrow lane , and a vision suddenly appears before our eyes , reflected in the light of fire - - a huge procession of people and horses . Some folks carry incense ; others are striking large gongs . Some are bearing little palanquins in which are seated statues of the village gods ; they excitedly crowd around Matsu 's seat of honor as it moves its way forward .  
For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu . The Wild Bird Society invited candidates from all three major parties to take part in the huge gathering . Of course , the harvest was bountiful - - at the event all three parties ' candidates promised once elected to build a nature preserve in Kuantu .  
As these five ports were all close to the teagrowing areas of southern China , the supply of tea became abundant and uninterrupted , and after the Treaty of Nanking the huge stocks of tea held in London 's warehouses expanded so much as to become a worrisome burden .  
Another example is monitoring of changes in forested areas . Keeping up with destructive exploitation or natural disasters ( like forest fires ) by using traditional survey techniques is time-consuming yet not timely , because of the huge extent and frequent inaccessibility of forested land ( which is often concentrated in remote mountain areas with no roads ) . Satellite surveys , on the other hand , cover huge areas and can be collected regularly , making them an invaluable tool .  
In the US , for example , residential and agricultural areas are clearly separate , and huge areas of agricultural land are often devoted to a single crop , so it is easy to differentiate the objects in the satellite image .  
" Multi-cinema theater houses are the trend of the future . Big theaters are only a promotional gimmick , the attraction of a huge screen , " says Robert Chen , associate professor of communication arts at Fujen Catholic University . During the 100-year development of the movie , it has evolved from an art form into a small-group social activity . It is easy to comprehend why empty echoes are often heard in the larger cinemas .  
It has spent a great amount of funds on a few species like the Formosan landlocked salmon and the Formosan sika , but concern for the maroon oriole and other species is conspicuously absent . A huge quantity of cash is spent on rebuilding sika deer numbers , but the southern cross-island highway will be allowed to divide the Mt . Tawu clouded leopard nature preserve .  
Sixty years later , opium was being sold in huge quantities , and the tottering Qing dynasty , ruling an increasingly impoverished and decadent populace , could stand it no more : They decided to strictly ban opium , and burned existing stocks . The result was the Opium War , which launched a century of national humiliation for China .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
Fiddler crabs of the species Uca borealis have an unusual choice of habitat : they live on muddy sandflats . Though their huge claws are beautifully colored and impressively shaped , they are not very mobile , so it seems they are there just for show - - to scare others off - - and not do any harm .  
However , the Japanese scholar " did not have any commercial interest , but on the contrary brought respect and affirmation to aboriginal culture . But the fact that Enigma earned huge profits from record sales-the album with Difag 's singing on it sold five million copies-has caused virtually everyone in Taiwan to think only in terms of what profit there is to be had . This seems to reflect some special feature of Taiwan 's culture , " Ming says , his voice tinged with regret . Return to innocence  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
Looking at the past , the last wave of stock fever-with its tidal wave cresting past the 10,000 mark , then falling with devastating force-ended up in a massive redistribution of wealth in Taiwan . When the market is unhealthy , it can be manipulated , and naturally the rich ended up richer and the poor , poorer . Moreover , the huge financial losses of the last cycle disrupted countless families and bankrupted many businesses .  
Just as botanists describe , on the most inhospitable mountaintops , amid powerful winds , biting frosts and heavy snow , on dry , infertile soil where conditions are too harsh even for the Formosan cypress and Hinoki cypress which otherwise grow to such huge size , Taiwan 's Yu-shan rhododendron ( R . pseudochrys-anthum ) shrugs off the unrelenting onslaught of the elements and grows in thick clumps everywhere , changing the color of the mountain forests and grassland .  
Western classical music is the furthest removed from life ; such a huge orchestra can not possibly be heard in ordinary life . But nobody ever asks questions about " the modern life of Western classical music . " The equipment of Western wind and string instrumental music is a form belonging to more than a century ago , but nobody ever wonders why orchestras do n't modernize .  
Because Kaohsiung harbor has a huge capacity , and is a pivotal spot for routes to southeast Asia , in the Japanese occupation era the authorities made it a concentration point for heavy industry and petroleum refining . After the outbreak of the war in the Pacific , Japan used Kaohsiung as a base for advancing southward , and established many military facilities there .  
What 's really depressing about this highway is the desolate vista presented by the heavy industry lining both sides . Whatever kind of grey and ugly industrial form you can think of-concrete factories , petroleum refineries , rusting old oil drums , discarded tire dumps , corrugated-steel structures put up without regard to building codes , construction machinery parks , steel smelters , chemical companies , oil pipeline , huge storage towers-they are all here . There 's only one thing you ca n't find , in fact : a tall green tree .  
In one of the Dunhuang Caves , you can find yourself surrounded on four sides by the petals of a giant lotus decoration , in which one peaceful Buddha after another sits in front of its own huge lotus petal . Since lotus petals and leaves have unusual shapes , you can always tell when a lotus flower is being depicted no matter if it has been stretched long , pressed flat , or molded into a square .  
What private sector publishing firms originally set their sights on was the huge primary school textbook market , which consists of over 300,000 student readers . This , plus the possibility of publishing additional reference materials and teaching aids , adds up to potentially enormous profits . It is the main reason publishers were initally jumping at the chance to get in on the textbook market .  
Most SREs are involved in activities intimately related to daily life , and are the foundation for national economic development . They may well be making huge surpluses-last year Chunghwa Telecom took in NT $ 49 billion in profits , CPC and Taipower more than NT $ 10 billion each-but that does n't mean they have been efficient . They have many shortcomings compared to similar service-providers abroad .  
" The strong prey on the weak , the old consume the young , " sighs one telecom company manager . Early on , the DGT earned huge profits with its exorbitant mobile phone charges ; it was this fat market that private firms yearned for .  
The main source of purchased ships and naval weaponry has always been the US . But the US , which has a global strategy and huge forces , has designed its ships to specialize in specific missions like air defense or ASW . For the ROC navy , which has far fewer ships and a smaller area of responsibility , highly specialized craft are not necessarily suitable . That is to say , even if Taiwan can procure US ships , it may be necessary to refit or supplement the weaponry .  
When we come to the Mennonite Christian Hospital in early December , a huge Christmas tree stands in the middle of the foyer of the newly completed hospital building . At the registration counter , in the consulting rooms , at the payment counter , at the pharmacy and even in the staff offices , everywhere is festooned with colored streamers , snowflakes and fairy lights . Instead of the cold , depressing atmosphere usually associated with hospitals , the place is full of the warm and festive spirit of Christmas .  
He no longer needed to punch a time-card or go to work . He no longer had a boss and was no longer controlled by anyone . Facing a huge expanse of unstructured time , he noticed : " I began to feel anxious , insecure and afraid . But all of these reactions forced me to become the master of my own life . "  
The economic basis of the Li clan 's livelihood had been laid down by Li Qingshui 's gradually buying up a huge area of farmland , but because the family suffered harassment from local tyrants , the seven brothers of the third generation decided to support the naturally gifted Li Shuhua , to allow him to devote himself completely to study . Shuhua really did pass the imperial examinations , and later became chief examining officer for the initial xiucai grade civil service exams for the whole of Taiwan .  
Recently natural wild plants have become popular foods in Taiwan , and aboriginal edible plants have become well-known in the process . However , edible plants account for only one-quarter of the plants used in daily life in Taniao village . Besides the necessities ( food , shelter , clothing ) , plants are essential materials for a huge number of other uses-medicine , landmarks , all kinds of tools used for outdoor work , rope , packaging , sandpaper , and cloth .  
Damiana is far from being an impressive plant . In the arid areas of the peninsula , which are dominated by huge columnar cacti and wide-canopied mesquite trees , its humble appearance may belie its importance for the local inhabitants . It is a small shrubby plant that grows in the dry soils of northern Mexico , Baja California and southern Texas .  
It was said that the plan was simply an effort to bail out the construction industry , and was not in the public interest . Reasons for this view included the huge amount of money involved , and the fact that the were no provisions to stop the rich or those who already owned homes from taking advantage of the special mortgage rate . In fact , anyone who wants to purchase a new home from a construction company is eligible for a low-interest mortgage to buy one .  
In a darkened room , masked bronze heads are laid out in two glowing sacrificial burial pits . Hanging on the wall is a huge photograph of the site where these treasures were recently unearthed after lying buried for thousands of years . In front of the photograph is a huge mask , its bug-eyes bulging out 16 cm from the sockets , staring straight at each modern-day visitor that enters through the time warp .  
Little did they know that just beneath their feet lay the buried remains of an ancient culture dating back to a period ranging from 2,800 to 4,800 years ago . After several decades of research , however , archeologists have brought to light spectacular proof of an ancient " Sanxingdui culture . " Relics have been unearthed at dozens of locations around the huge Sanxingdui site , which covers a total area of more than 15 square kilometers .  
Just as the archeologists were beginning to calm down after the discovery of pit # 1 , the adrenaline started pumping again . As before , the soil was rammed hard , and once again , one stunning item after another was unearthed-over 60 elephant tusks , numerous delicate and complex bronze zun and lei ( an urn-shaped wine vessel ) , bronze heads bedecked in a wide assortment of finery , and a huge bronze mask measuring over 130 cm from side to side .  
Now that the Sanxingdui exhibit has brought over a huge bronze statue of a man and many other exotic items , another blockbuster exhibit from the mainland has been scheduled for October . The autumn event will feature the superbly preserved silk paintings found at the Mawangdui site in Hunan Province as well as the stunning jade pieces discovered in Guangzhou at the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom . Going in the other direction , a private Taiwanese collection ( Ku Yue Ko ) was put on exhibit four years ago at the Palace Museum in Beijing .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry . But innovation requires huge quantities of financial and human resources dedicated to R &amp; D , with laboratories pursuing technological breakthroughs around the clock , and with professional investment managers able to turn innovative ideas into products and profits . "  
Many music industry insiders in both Taiwan and the mainland agree that her former producer , the late Chang Yu-sheng , played a huge role in A-Mei 's rise to stardom . In songs like " Sisters " and " Bad Boy , " Chang masterfully brought out the " feral intensity of this small-town aboriginal girl . " Chang used distinctive lyrics , catchy tunes , A-Mei 's unique image , and an effective PR strategy to great advantage . Xiao Ke points to another example of slick promotion in the Taiwanese pop music industry .  
That Liu Shao-tang 's death elicited such a huge response at a time when all of Taiwan 's media are packed with electoral news in the run-up to the March presidential ballot , is not only a measure of the widespread respect which Liu earned by his lifelong professionalism and refusal to lower standards , but also shows that Taiwan is still a place with deep feelings and concern for intellectual matters .  
All of these developments will have a huge impact on the future well-being of the human race , yet for many of us they are distant and unfamiliar . This is particularly true of genetic engineering , considered the biggest breakthrough in the life sciences since genetics and molecular biology . Man has begun to probe the very origins of life .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease-fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "  
The construction budget for the new terminal at CKS Airport , which opened in July , included a public art allocation of NT $ 100 million . Deciding how to handle this huge sum proved a difficult task for the project 's executive committee . Many people questioned whether public art has to be limited to the installation of permanent " works of art . "  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
The famous Tang dynasty physician Sun Simao spent huge sums of money to learn spells and charms from various sources . He admitted that these occult techniques were not especially desirable or palatable , nor did they have a compelling logic behind them , but , he added , they had proved more effective than he expected , and that is why he included them in his medical text Qian Jin Yi Fang .  
While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
The pair get married , but the Snake King arrives disguised as a local village girl and steals the magic feather . In the end , Wan Shi turns into a huge boulder to pin down the Snake King , while the egret goddess gives up her magic feather to save the island , which has been laid to waste . Thanks to the sacrifices of Wan Shi and the egret goddess , the people are able to live in peace once again .  
" Industrial firms in Taiwan have expanded capacity furiously over the past decade and produced in huge quantities . The result has been destructive price competition that has left producers badly weakened . " Central banks throughout the world have responded by lowering interest rates in an attempt to revive their economies . The US Federal Reserve Board has lowered the prime lending rate ten times this year , and Japan 's interest rates have been at zero for a long time , but rapidly declining investments have greatly reduced the effectiveness of such monetary measures .  
In recent years , every major meeting among industrialized nations having anything to do with economic globalization has been accompanied by rioting and protests . In particular , the huge riots in Seattle in 1999 have ignited a big upsurge in opposition to globalization . The G8 summit held this past July in Genoa , Italy was besieged by over 100,000 protesters .  
However , it can not be denied that virtually all advanced capitalist countries operate national or local lotteries . Moreover , before Taiwan began public lotteries , illegal lotteries were already widespread ( and still exist ) , and even the stockmarket-itself a casino given the prevalence of " hot buys " and " insider information " - attracted huge number of " players . "  
" Independent , close to ordinary people 's hearts , vital , spring-flowering , sublimely pure and noble . " Students involved in the student movement of the late 1980s created a huge wild lily modeled on the Statue of Liberty , to symbolize the spirit of the Taiwanese student movement .  
After the government of the Republic of China came to Taiwan in 1949 , the island of Kinmen became the front line in the Chinese Civil War and an important military base . A huge network of tunnels was dug out underground , while , on the surface , lovely traditional villages remained totally intact .  
The false cypress forests which bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing Taiwan 's fragmented earth , also form a safety valve for the Shihmen Reservoir , Tanshui River and Lanyang River on which the people of northern Taiwan depend for their drinking water . The band of cypress forest that runs from Mt . Chilan to Mt . Lala forms a huge natural reservoir that soaks up heavy rainfall and releases it in gentler flows while keeping the soil firmly in its grasp , in a way that no human engineering project could replicate .  
Compared to an intense volcanic eruption on land , when an entire mountain turns red and a huge cloud of smoke and debris rises up into the heavens , the eruptions around Penghu were much smaller . The effect was rather more like liquid flowing through cracks . The lava flowed through , covering up the area all around , forming into flat or low-gradient tablelands tens of meters deep called " mesas . "  
However , after World War I began , Japan began to develop gold and coal mining on a large-scale in Taiwan , for two main reasons . First , Japan at that point had the second-largest naval fleet in the world , requiring huge amounts of coal . In addition , Japan had to import most of its strategic materials , and in those days international trade was still gold-based , requiring gold to purchase products from abroad .  
When he was born in mid-Tang times in 768 AD , both Buddhism and Taoism were very much part of the social mainstream . Both Buddhist monks and Taoist priests were treated respectfully , and they not only shared the privileges of the emperor and nobility , but many also possessed huge tracts of land and were exempt from paying taxes .  
However , external criticism focused on how the Ministry of Finance turned the eighth seat over to representation by the Executive Yuan Development Fund . If the shares held by the Executive Yuan Development Fund are sold off under the announced privatization policy , the government will lose its board majority . If there is a change of government after the presidential elections next year , the huge operational power of Mega Holdings will revert to private shareholders and chairman Cheng Shen-chi 's position will become unassailable .  
NTU 's impressive influence has continued for half a century and remains as robust as ever . As Lin Ku-fang-chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at Fokuang University 's College of Humanities and himself a Taida grad ( in archeology ) - reminds us , " The importance of National Taiwan University is not in that today it still has the highest average test scores among incoming freshmen of any school in the country , nor that it enjoys political influence and gets huge amounts of money from the government .  
In recent years the daily customer traffic in the larger bookstores of major centers like Beijing and Shanghai has often hit the tens of thousands , and several have already been given " must-see " status in travel guides sold in Taiwan . To deal with the stream of visitors , the stores have expanded , improved their air-conditioning systems , taken on huge numbers of staff , and increased the width of the aisles between bookshelves ; the luxuriousness and sheer size of the stores is nothing short of amazing .  
" Although you could n't really say that the number of contracts actually signed is huge , we 're setting ourselves up for the future as a kind of consultant , helping integrate and strengthen each individual client according to their respective distribution weaknesses , " says Choice Group vice-chairman Jimmy Cheng . Choice also plan to set up a new arm , providing specialist help to Taiwanese publishers through their in-depth knowledge of the particular political and commercial environment of the mainland .  
The mainland is a massive country , and the distance between urban areas is huge . Profits from distribution and retailing of books and magazines are small , even though the ' planned economy ' is gradually being dismantled , and soon it will be far too difficult to set up a wide-ranging logistics and shipping network . Because of this , some publishers are choosing not to sell through bookstores , instead looking for an alternative way , facing their own technological difficulties on the way .  
One experience I will never forget . At Easter , we traveled to the western regions of Queensland . We departed at 4 a.m . and drove past wheat farms , corn farms , crossing a huge broad land , from tall bush to short scrub , from gray-yellow land to bright red . It was fantastic !  
At the height of its production the Wushulin plant pressed as much as 1,600 metric tons of cane daily . Not only did Wushulin have a huge capacity , its products were of excellent quality and were specially designated for use by the Japanese royal household . As a result , the plant was much praised by the colonial " motherland . "  
When resources were short and a good number of books were forbidden , it was the second-hand book market that helped spread knowledge , and reading was considered more important than collecting . Today there are up to 400,000 new books published a year , so why do people still want to collect old books ? " It 's because the sheer volume of books being published is huge , it 's like a sea of books out there .  
Compound Eyes examines the question of environmental ethics , and tells a riveting ecological tale that juxtaposes the huge and the miniscule , the distant and the near , the perfect and the flawed .  
For a work like No Holding Back , with the trio sculpted completely in the round , the posture and attitude of the three figures was a huge compositional challenge . In each stroke of the knife , there was little room for error . Every single angle had to be taken into consideration . Although the subject of the work was a traditional story , the piece nevertheless had a distinctly modern feel to it .  
This was the time that " campus folk music " was just beginning to sweep Taiwan , and Lee was right on time to get on board the train . Drawing on the elegant structures of classical music , he wrote " Olive Tree , " a pop piece infused with tremendous artistry . As sung by Chi Yu , an artist known for her angelic voice , the song immediately made a huge impression both home and abroad , and is considered one of the genuine classics of the folk music era .  
The erudite Buddhist master Yin-Shun , said to be " the most eminent Buddhist since Xuan Zang , " celebrated his 100th birthday in late April , on the 20th day of the third lunar month . A huge conference was held jointly by Buddhist religious and academic communities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . It was a memorable event , as many Buddhist groups in Taiwan have been inspired by Yin-Shun 's teaching , and were in attendance to mark his birthday .  
Speaking of sports marketing , retired NBA star Michael Jordan recently ruffled feathers in Taiwan in a whirlwind stopover , ducking out of sight after a quick 90-second appearance before fans who had waited three hours to see him . High-flying Taiwan Nike eventually had to make a public apology for the fiasco . The company had thought to score a marketing coup on the strength of Jordan 's huge appeal , but the incident only proved that fans can put you on a pedestal , and fans can pull you back off it .  
But even if he was often scatterbrained and had a dull look in his eyes off the field , he was extraordinary when he took the mound , almost never disappointing Coach Huang . With a 145-km / h fastball coming off his hand , a slow breaking ball that cut a huge arc on its way to the plate , and a tricky slider , hitters on the opposing teams could see Wu 's pitches dance their way to the plate , but one after another they failed to get a bat on the ball .  
Now , that land is more than just a " natural classroom " for the 11 classes on ecology , flora , and fauna at the college ; it 's also been opened to the public , becoming a well known place for the people of Yungho and Chungho-particularly local elementary and junior high school kids-to come and get in touch with nature . The college also trains volunteer guides for the garden to meet the huge demand from the local community to visit it .  
" Back in the early days , " recalls Lee , " Eslite found itself stuck with huge numbers of foreign-language books in stock . Over time , we refined our business model and learned what we needed to order . We became selective and stopped having to dump books to clear our inventory . "  
Changhua City has a long history , but now it seems to have hit a wall , unable to get beyond its current population level or its geographical limitations , stuck running second to Taichung . But the past was different . Old Changhua once held the spotlight , especially its train station . A popular rest stop in the long north-south train journey , the station made a huge impression on all who visited it , and was the pride of Changhua .
