These character inscriptions provide valuable information as to the life during this early period of Chinese history .

The main reason that scholars on Taiwan have been lax in studying the island 's seventeenth century history , Dr . Nakamura feels , is the shortage of historical materials available to them .

New Environment Foundation founder Prof . Ch'ai Sung-lin , who has written on Taiwan folk beliefs , maintains the popularity of divination reflects modern man 's inner uncertainty and helplessness in the face of rapid social changes and confused values . Apparent social injustices , such as businessmen profiting by exploiting legal loopholes , or lackluster politicians getting to the top , have led people to conclude that success depends more on good luck than personal effort .

Applying mental reasoning Chang Shih-tsung is adept at finding lateral links between things , using supporting material and coming up with new deductions .

Most people will say that spoken or sung folk literature serves the purpose of instructing , encouraging and consoling the illiterate masses .

I have a keen interest in Chinese living in other parts of the world , and Sinorama gives a fascinating account of fellow Chinese in some very surprising countries .  
But our local languages , especially within the Chinese language group , use ideographic rather than phonetic writing , and there is a clear separation between colloquial pronunciations and bookish pronunciations ; also some words have no written form , and some pronunciations are far removed from the written form .

Actually this is partly because since people feared vicious dogs , it was only natural for them to compare them jestingly with the even more ferocious tiger , as in this joke about an " illiterate dog " : In olden times legend had it that the written character for tiger , or the character for the tiger 's associated Earthly Branch yin , had the power to subdue a dog . There was once a dog which liked to bite people , and everyone was afraid of it and did not dare to pass it .  
But happily , since the lifting of martial law , the shackles of censorship have been removed from the written word , and politicians too have escaped the extremes of " deification " and " vilification , " to be brought back down to the plane of humanity and the ordinary citizen . And as it is no longer taboo to talk freely about politics , many people are happy to speak and readers are happy to read , and this has generated the current wave of political biographies .  
Over thirty years , I wrote five books in Chinese . Since becoming ill , in less than half a year I have written two . I have discovered that my potential can be devoted to writing . This confidence is also something that readers have built up for me .

When she writes about her current home , New York ( especially Central Park ) , or about places she has visited such as Alaska or Egypt , the mood is peaceful and unburdened .

Perhaps a passage by veteran reporter Ku Meng-jen , written as a commentary on Chong Shu 's novel The Chinese People , is particularly apropos : " From the Chinese laborers of the past to the immigrants of today , from the narrow alleys of Chinatown to present-day Silicon Valley , the peregrine steps of the overseas Chinese on the one hand reflect the changes of the times , and on the other hand express the growth of the Chinese people in foreign society .

The first time that I had attended a traditional Chinese wedding .  
This , he says , deeply embarrassed Luo and was the cause of the bad blood between them . These explanations caused Luo , who really was out of the country , to become the prime suspect .

The discovery of oracle bone inscriptions rebuilt knowledge of a royal dynasty which some had suspected was imaginary , and the many neolithic sites discovered in mainland China over the past few decades have not only shown up even earlier traces of written language , but have also debunked the idea which we learned from childhood , that China 's central plain was the cradle of Chinese civilization .  
Besides , from ancient times , Chinese people have shown total respect to the written word . You can even say that they are overly reverent toward it . This caused music , which is most inimical to written language , to turn into written records in the hands of the scholars ; and at the same time , to be combined with political ritual and become the system of " ceremonial music . " In the past , the focus of what scholars came in contact with in music was this type of political , ritual music .  
Ah , the resplendent Chinese garden , with its winding pathways , miniature bridges , and trickling brooks . How many elegant literati have written poems in its praise ?

And , because the Three Kingdoms requires a knowledge of military tactics , it pushes players to study history more deeply outside the game .

Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
In contrast with today , when wild ducks live on river beds choked with stinking organic chemicals and strewn with styrofoam and other plastics , in written records from the past the ducks suck up red algae , delve beneath green lotus leaves , wash themselves with dew and live among clouds and mists .  
This recognition returned me again to thinking about that tension experienced by the expatriate between the nagging desire to retreat back to one 's own country and the dogged intention to stay where one is . And it suggested some common ground between the fear and fascination I see written on the face of the two-year-old who comes upon me in the mall and my own fascination with the specter , every day repeated , on sidewalks all around me filled with " foreign " Asian faces .  
Qiuran Ke Zhuan ( The Curly-Bearded Stranger ) is a Tang-dynasty romance set in the late Sui , written by Du Guangting ( 850-933 ) . In it , Curlybeard 's friend Liu Wenjing , a Daoist master , plays a game of chess with Li Shimin ( 599-649 ) , the future founding emperor of the Tang . Seeing Li 's kingly poise and countenance , the Daoist says sadly : " This match is quite lost ! "  
On a whiteboard on the wall , we see the words : " The wise are always good at caring for people , so that none is abandoned ; always good at caring for things , so that nothing is thrown away . . . . " This aphoristic couplet , although written in classical Chinese , is not hard to understand , and with the practical illustrations just given by the speaker , no wonder the listeners are all nodding vigorously .  
Beginning in 2001 , English will become a required course in elementary schools . " Now the English parts of both the college and high-school joint entrance exams are growing trickier . Whether one is talking about written tests or oral tests , they both require excellent English , " says Chang Yu-heng senior staff editor for Landmark English . It 's only natural that students need English magazines to bolster their efforts to learn the language .  
The botanist Chen Yu-feng has written : " The process of mountain formation in Taiwan has already passed its most active phase , and the arrangement of its tall mountains has basically been established .

As written in Introduction to the Cultural History of China : " With the stability of centralized government and the establishment of civil administration , political problems were gradually resolved . But the end of equal distribution of wealth within farming settlements , and the burgeoning of commercial enterprise , led many people to focus on the issue of society 's widening economic gap . "  
If you only knew about these two , you would think that the women of the Han court either spent their days relying on their beauty as weapons in internecine power struggles , or ended up getting married off to the ruler of a distant land to cement some strategic alliance . A code of proper female conduct was explicitly prescribed for the first time by two books that were written about 2,000 years ago .  
People have long criticized Chinese society for putting more emphasis on human relationships than on written codes . But many people do not know that during the Han dynasty , China had a comprehensive set of laws that was every bit as impressive as the renowned imperial Roman civil code .  
He finally left Taiwan in 1947 . When I went to Japan last January and paid my respects at his grave , I discovered that his gravestone was inscribed in Atayal . I used to cry every time I talked about this wonderful doctor , but I 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by . I have to hurry up and get the book written . "  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
It 's a chicken-and-egg problem . The best work that appears in Biographical Literature are the stories written by participants in history themselves . Each time there were power shifts in Republican era , another group of elites was washed out ; later , settled in Taiwan and far removed from day-to-day politics , they were willing to write for the magazine . Being good writers with broad perspectives , naturally they produced exciting and engrossing material , which , by keeping the standards of the magazine up , attracted more of the same .  
His disciples have written over a dozen works of their " personal testaments , " all telling of miracles : being brought back from the brink of death or saved from some calamity . Now that Lee 's organization is gaining more adherents in the Taipei metropolitan area , he has become a somewhat legendary figure . Below is an edited version of our interview with him .  
He said that because Amis culture was always transmitted orally , there is no written record of traditional culture . Thus every time he goes to a tribal village to film , it is a race against time .

Hsia spent over 20 years in New York , painting in the cavernous gloom of his loft , eating Chinese food and listening to traditional Chinese opera music . The walls of the loft were pasted with simple verses , written by Hsia in language that was part literary Chinese and part colloquial .  
The Chinese word amulet is made up of two characters : fu [ ] , meaning roughly tally or warrant , and zhou [ ] , which means an incantation or magic word . According to a number of ancient texts , the character fu refers to divine prescripts from the heavenly powers-that-be . This is a mirror-image of the traditional Chinese bureaucratic system , in which the emperor ordered his ministers and generals about using written commands called fu .  
With regard to some ancient amulets that are supposed to be able to inflict physical harm , Li takes a stab at a more scientific-sounding explanation . Take for example an amulet whose characters are written out using a combination of bodily fluids from a corpse and chicken blood . Perhaps , avers Li , the bacteria in the bodily fluids of the corpse reproduce by using the chicken blood as a nutrient . Someone drinking such a mix would probably get sick .  
" The natural environment is always changing . Even if the number of monkeys has been increasing in the short term , there are so many uncertain factors that it is very hard to say that their populations will grow in the long term .

Taipei City was the earliest jurisdiction to implement multiple channels of entry for high schools . Many high schools adopted new criteria for admission , including recommendation , weighting of particular classes , a second round of testing ( oral or written ) , or calculation of the overall junior high school grade point average .

Here at the other end of the Earth in Taiwan , the wise words written in the Bible 2000 years ago are borne out : on Linshan Point , a windswept promontory jutting out into the sea from Taiwan 's north coast , between the sandy beach and the rock face there grows a carpet of tough coastal plants , including a scattering of short-stemmed flowers .  
Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth .

Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
Art critic Wang Chia-chi points out that Installation Art in Taiwan is basically written from the creative perspective of the artist , expressing both sympathy and empathy for the subject matter covered . As such , when Yao explains works , he strives to fathom the original creative intent of each artist .

" A truly professional art therapist will not show off her ability to interpret paintings . On the contrary , she 'll keep this coolly to herself until the individual has acquired the needed courage , until the patient 's timid spirit has grown strong enough , " Lu Su-chen , art therapy consultant for the Student Counseling Center of National Tsing Hua University , has written .  
The works of Han Han are most representative of this genre and are very popular with younger readers . When he was 16 , Han Han became an overnight sensation with the publication of his novel Three Doors .

The rebellious nature of his books brings to mind Refusing to Take the Joint Entrance Exam , which was written by Wu Hsiang-hui in Taiwan two decades earlier .  
Over the past four years , the Parisanan Association has undertaken many activities to promote this matter . They have successively mobilized 10,000 people to sign a petition , held talks with local elders to get their agreement , paid formal visits to senior officials to seek their backing , scouted out the track foundations , and made written proposals . After a long , uphill battle , they have finally got the attention of the county government , who then evaluated their plan .

The way the Ordinance is written has put the main burden of proof on the attending medical practitioner because he has received professional training and would be the most suitable person to give justifications for the application .

These character inscriptions provide valuable information as to the life during this early period of Chinese history . The late years of the Chou marked the beginning of a long period of political instability throughout north and east China .

The main reason that scholars on Taiwan have been lax in studying the island 's seventeenth century history , Dr . Nakamura feels , is the shortage of historical materials available to them .

New Environment Foundation founder Prof . Ch'ai Sung-lin , who has written on Taiwan folk beliefs , maintains the popularity of divination reflects modern man 's inner uncertainty and helplessness in the face of rapid social changes and confused values . Apparent social injustices , such as businessmen profiting by exploiting legal loopholes , or lackluster politicians getting to the top , have led people to conclude that success depends more on good luck than personal effort .

Applying mental reasoning Chang Shih-tsung is adept at finding lateral links between things , using supporting material and coming up with new deductions .

The higher the lantern tower and the more lost souls attracted , the greater the merit accrued .  
Then starting with the T'ang dynasty , propitious phrases were written on the red paper , which learned men required to be in phonically matched couplets . In this way , the gradual transformation from peachwood charms to New Year 's scrolls came about .  
Most people will say that spoken or sung folk literature serves the purpose of instructing , encouraging and consoling the illiterate masses . There 's nothing wrong with this , but one ought to take it a step farther . Written literature does in fact develop from folk literature .

I have a keen interest in Chinese living in other parts of the world , and Sinorama gives a fascinating account of fellow Chinese in some very surprising countries .  
But our local languages , especially within the Chinese language group , use ideographic rather than phonetic writing , and there is a clear separation between colloquial pronunciations and bookish pronunciations ; also some words have no written form , and some pronunciations are far removed from the written form . All these problems go to show that if one wishes to study local vernaculars , one faces the problem of the lack of a standardized writing system and phonetic notation .  
Actually this is partly because since people feared vicious dogs , it was only natural for them to compare them jestingly with the even more ferocious tiger , as in this joke about an " illiterate dog " : In olden times legend had it that the written character for tiger , or the character for the tiger 's associated Earthly Branch yin , had the power to subdue a dog . There was once a dog which liked to bite people , and everyone was afraid of it and did not dare to pass it .  
But happily , since the lifting of martial law , the shackles of censorship have been removed from the written word , and politicians too have escaped the extremes of " deification " and " vilification , " to be brought back down to the plane of humanity and the ordinary citizen . And as it is no longer taboo to talk freely about politics , many people are happy to speak and readers are happy to read , and this has generated the current wave of political biographies .  
Over thirty years , I wrote five books in Chinese . Since becoming ill , in less than half a year I have written two . I have discovered that my potential can be devoted to writing . This confidence is also something that readers have built up for me .

When she writes about her current home , New York ( especially Central Park ) , or about places she has visited such as Alaska or Egypt , the mood is peaceful and unburdened .

Perhaps a passage by veteran reporter Ku Meng-jen , written as a commentary on Chong Shu 's novel The Chinese People , is particularly apropos : " From the Chinese laborers of the past to the immigrants of today , from the narrow alleys of Chinatown to present-day Silicon Valley , the peregrine steps of the overseas Chinese on the one hand reflect the changes of the times , and on the other hand express the growth of the Chinese people in foreign society .

The first time that I had attended a traditional Chinese wedding .  
This , he says , deeply embarrassed Luo and was the cause of the bad blood between them . These explanations caused Luo , who really was out of the country , to become the prime suspect . Upon his return , Luo immediately launched a counter-offensive , charging that the entire kidnapping was just a stunt cooked up by Liao himself , and that the note was written with the intent of casting suspicion on Luo .

The discovery of oracle bone inscriptions rebuilt knowledge of a royal dynasty which some had suspected was imaginary , and the many neolithic sites discovered in mainland China over the past few decades have not only shown up even earlier traces of written language , but have also debunked the idea which we learned from childhood , that China 's central plain was the cradle of Chinese civilization .  
Besides , from ancient times , Chinese people have shown total respect to the written word . You can even say that they are overly reverent toward it . This caused music , which is most inimical to written language , to turn into written records in the hands of the scholars ; and at the same time , to be combined with political ritual and become the system of " ceremonial music .

Ah , the resplendent Chinese garden , with its winding pathways , miniature bridges , and trickling brooks . How many elegant literati have written poems in its praise ?

Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
In contrast with today , when wild ducks live on river beds choked with stinking organic chemicals and strewn with styrofoam and other plastics , in written records from the past the ducks suck up red algae , delve beneath green lotus leaves , wash themselves with dew and live among clouds and mists .  
This recognition returned me again to thinking about that tension experienced by the expatriate between the nagging desire to retreat back to one 's own country and the dogged intention to stay where one is . And it suggested some common ground between the fear and fascination I see written on the face of the two-year-old who comes upon me in the mall and my own fascination with the specter , every day repeated , on sidewalks all around me filled with " foreign " Asian faces .  
Qiuran Ke Zhuan ( The Curly-Bearded Stranger ) is a Tang-dynasty romance set in the late Sui , written by Du Guangting ( 850-933 ) .

On a whiteboard on the wall , we see the words : " The wise are always good at caring for people , so that none is abandoned ; always good at caring for things , so that nothing is thrown away . . . . " This aphoristic couplet , although written in classical Chinese , is not hard to understand , and with the practical illustrations just given by the speaker , no wonder the listeners are all nodding vigorously .  
Beginning in 2001 , English will become a required course in elementary schools . " Now the English parts of both the college and high-school joint entrance exams are growing trickier .

As written in Introduction to the Cultural History of China : " With the stability of centralized government and the establishment of civil administration , political problems were gradually resolved . But the end of equal distribution of wealth within farming settlements , and the burgeoning of commercial enterprise , led many people to focus on the issue of society 's widening economic gap . "  
If you only knew about these two , you would think that the women of the Han court either spent their days relying on their beauty as weapons in internecine power struggles , or ended up getting married off to the ruler of a distant land to cement some strategic alliance . A code of proper female conduct was explicitly prescribed for the first time by two books that were written about 2,000 years ago .  
People have long criticized Chinese society for putting more emphasis on human relationships than on written codes . But many people do not know that during the Han dynasty , China had a comprehensive set of laws that was every bit as impressive as the renowned imperial Roman civil code .  
He finally left Taiwan in 1947 . When I went to Japan last January and paid my respects at his grave , I discovered that his gravestone was inscribed in Atayal . I used to cry every time I talked about this wonderful doctor , but I 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by . I have to hurry up and get the book written . "  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written .

It 's a chicken-and-egg problem . The best work that appears in Biographical Literature are the stories written by participants in history themselves . Each time there were power shifts in Republican era , another group of elites was washed out ; later , settled in Taiwan and far removed from day-to-day politics , they were willing to write for the magazine . Being good writers with broad perspectives , naturally they produced exciting and engrossing material , which , by keeping the standards of the magazine up , attracted more of the same .  
His disciples have written over a dozen works of their " personal testaments , " all telling of miracles : being brought back from the brink of death or saved from some calamity . Now that Lee 's organization is gaining more adherents in the Taipei metropolitan area , he has become a somewhat legendary figure . Below is an edited version of our interview with him .  
He said that because Amis culture was always transmitted orally , there is no written record of traditional culture . Thus every time he goes to a tribal village to film , it is a race against time .

The Chinese word amulet is made up of two characters : fu [ ] , meaning roughly tally or warrant , and zhou [ ] , which means an incantation or magic word . According to a number of ancient texts , the character fu refers to divine prescripts from the heavenly powers-that-be . This is a mirror-image of the traditional Chinese bureaucratic system , in which the emperor ordered his ministers and generals about using written commands called fu .  
With regard to some ancient amulets that are supposed to be able to inflict physical harm , Li takes a stab at a more scientific-sounding explanation . Take for example an amulet whose characters are written out using a combination of bodily fluids from a corpse and chicken blood .

Taipei City was the earliest jurisdiction to implement multiple channels of entry for high schools . Many high schools adopted new criteria for admission , including recommendation , weighting of particular classes , a second round of testing ( oral or written ) , or calculation of the overall junior high school grade point average .

Here at the other end of the Earth in Taiwan , the wise words written in the Bible 2000 years ago are borne out : on Linshan Point , a windswept promontory jutting out into the sea from Taiwan 's north coast , between the sandy beach and the rock face there grows a carpet of tough coastal plants , including a scattering of short-stemmed flowers .  
Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth .

Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
Art critic Wang Chia-chi points out that Installation Art in Taiwan is basically written from the creative perspective of the artist , expressing both sympathy and empathy for the subject matter covered .

The works of Han Han are most representative of this genre and are very popular with younger readers .

The rebellious nature of his books brings to mind Refusing to Take the Joint Entrance Exam , which was written by Wu Hsiang-hui in Taiwan two decades earlier .
