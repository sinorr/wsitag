Community cultural activities will be held regularly during weekends or vacations . A spirit of good neighborliness is sure to prevail , and mutual assistance within an interdependent entity will become common . In collaboration with religious and civic bodies , the government will endeavor to foster and encourage ethical norms which are in conformity with our present-day society , itself a product of popular customs and mores blended with traditional rites and ceremonies .  
Generally speaking , the classical and traditional performing arts are most popular with businessmen . Avant-garde and experimental art is not what they 're after , " Yin points out . Large American and European corporations usually support symphony orchestras and ballet companies , and businessmen in Japan are even more conservative : They consider the firm 's reputation their lifeblood and are even less willing to tie the corporate image to a newcomer .  
The fourth costume consists of a plain blue dress of the early Republican period reflecting ordinary family life of the time . The fifth costume is a cheongsam , originally worn in the Ch'ing dynasty but still popular today , a typically Chinese style of women 's dress .  
As a result , starting with cinnabar elixirs and mystical techniques designed to ensure immortality , Taoism in due course assimilated the spiritual exercises of Zen Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism . As it transformed itself into a widespread popular belief it thus became an integral part of the lives of the common folk . (  
Eventually people strung together some of the popular songs existing in the countryside , blending them in with plots from vernacular fiction and song-texts and inserting a few charming stage steps and movements derived from ch'e-ku and ts'ai-ch'a drama . The result was a new type of folk drama with a strong element of local color and the main emphasis on singing .  
Several of the most popular areas of research , such as the encroachment of Western imperialism on China , Christianity in China , Chinese political philosophy and the spread of education were all aimed at gaining a quick understanding of modern China , and areas not related to contemporary China were neglected .  
A task such as folding spirit money into ingots helps the surviving family gather together and work off their sad thoughts through a routine ritual . Furthermore , by performing a last helpful action for the loved one the survivors are eased of the painful feeling of not having done enough for them while there was still time . " These days burning spirit money is more popular in Taiwan than ever before . "  
Strawberry picking has become a popular leisure activity for city dwellers , and no doubt many people have picked the big red " Taoyuan No . 1 " strawberries at some pick-your-own strawberry farm . This strawberry was developed in Japan and a Japanese patent has been applied for . Local growers also used to carry plants away lock , stock and barrel after they 'd featured in Dutch exhibitions in Taiwan aimed at opening up the local flower market .  
After a bleak period lasting some years radio is back on its feet again , and facing the future with renewed optimism . Television is the chief adversary of radio among the broadcast media , but surveys reveal that the most popular radio presenter over the last two years has been Lo Hsiao-yun , whose program Intimate Listening airs six evenings a week from eight to ten o'clock - - which happens to be television 's prime time .  
Radio drama and other popular programs went into decline once TV began to air similar shows . From its peak in 1961 , radio listenership fell to an all-time low after the Chinese Television System hit the screens in 1971 . Not only did that familiar image of the family grouped around the radio set vanish , but one researcher at the time even found that many interviewees were unable to help with his survey for the simple reason that they never listened to radio at all .  
Whether or not a program being planned to pass on traditional performing arts to the younger generation becomes a reality will depend on receiving a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development . It 's worth noting that Yang Hsiu-ching and Yang Tzai-hsiung , a husband-and-wife team that has won a National Heritage Award for their achievements in Taiwanese shuo-ch'ang ( a form of popular entertainment featuring singing and comic dialogue ) and is considered a town treasure , have moved back to Hsichih after living elsewhere for many years .  
The best abacuses for everyday use have frames made from black sandalwood . More popular models use frames of compressed sawdust composite . The beads are fashioned from cherry wood imported from Japan .  
But one can discover from many popular stories that the Jade Emperor is buy no means beyond anger and fury , completely impersonal and objective , or able to see all the fine points clearly . On the contrary , He is quite " human , " and often becomes angry so that the common people suffer through no fault of their own , or listens to rumors and half-truths .  
Tradition has it that these three gods , dressed in full imperial attire , are transformations of the sacred emperors of old , Yao , Shun , and Yu . Their birthdays - - coming on the 15th day of the first , seventh , and tenth months of the year on the Chinese lunar calendar - - have an important status among customary popular celebrations .  
According to a survey done three years ago by Shao Li-fang , a lecturer at Shih Chien College , less than a third of unmarried people considered themselves " elite singles , " as a popular Chinese expression goes . Although most of them said they were content with their lot , half admitted they were lonely and missed having someone to take care of them .  
Add to this that modern people are more carefree about heirs , and also that medical advances have decreased concerns about having children at a later age ; and moreover it is more and more popular for the divorced or widowed to seek a second spring - - all these things mean that age is already not a crucial factor in deciding on whether it is appropriate to marry .  
This traditional " matchmaker " field , which one would have thought would have been wiped out by free choice in love and marriage , is not only alive and kicking ; in the last ten years it has experienced a complete turnaround to become a hot profession . Besides the matchmaking columns and programs popular in the media , an even greater number of specialized , commercialized " modern super matchmakers " are popping up everywhere .  
Hsiao Min , a Christian , says that every time the passage to a new year approaches , churches will print their own red envelopes , which congregants can use at no charge . Because propitious proverbs from the Bible have been imprinted on the set , they are very popular among the congregants , so that supply ca n't keep up with demand . Since they integrate traditional customs , they can also help the evangelical church spread and adapt to local conditions . "  
" Absorbing foreign myths is one of the special features of Chinese culture , " says Cheng Chih - ming , an associate professor in the Graduate School of Theology at Fu Jen University , who studies popular religion in Taiwan . For example there is the male deity Kuan Yin , who transformed into Princess Miaoshan , the beloved daughter of King Miaochuang , after coming to China , and from that transformed into Kuan Yin , the Goddess of Mercy .  
Before the discovery of the microscope , and before " ecological observation " became popular , when our ancestors saw these insects emerge from soft earth and light up , they imagined that the firefly was a metamorphosis from rotting leaves or decaying bamboo . The saying , " On summer nights , rotting grass turns into fireflies , " was a natural result of observing transformations as the weather changed from season to season .  
The most popular food for new mothers in Taiwan is sesame oil chicken . Chicken is the most digestible form of high-protein meat , while sesame oil is rich in vitamin E , calcium and iron and is said to help the uterus contract and eliminate lochia , or the discharge of blood , tissue and mucus after childbirth . The two main seasonings in sesame oil chicken - - ginger and rice wine - - are supposed to remove cold from the body and stimulate circulation .  
It 's got a strong smell when you 're eating it , and it 's packed with flavor too . The steamed stinky tofu in Chekiang restaurants is also very popular . It can be mixed with green beans or hot sauce and other flavorings .  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
If it is true that in popular fashion " there is no such thing as absolute rebellion or subversion " and that anti-social and counter-cultural behavior will ultimately be co-opted by the mainstream , then flashy protest can only bring fleeting personal pleasure and has no real function in terms of bringing about social change . Moreover , gender performance can only be done for performance 's sake .  
Some people have criticized Tsui Hark 's Huang Fei-hong as " superficial " and lacking the real martial skills of a great master . The constant use of ropes , of special effects which go beyond the humanly and physically possible , and of speededup action , the all-pervading Chinese popular aesthetic , the dramatic camera angles , the melodramatic dialogues and plot development , create an overall effect which is " very exciting , " but the special qualities of the main character Huang Fei-hong become rather blurred .  
In terms of meteorological significance , Solar Terms can at most indicate ' the most probable period of sunlight , ' " states Wu Ming-chin . If the weather is favorable , planting according to the Solar Terms will yield the most abundant harvest . Luckily , the Solar Terms are still quite popular among farmers , who are not accustomed to calculating so precisely .  
Asia is their homeAs an object of research , the tawny fish owl is less dangerous than the Formosan black bear , and not as rare as the now extinct clouded leopard . The tawny fish owl is found in India , mainland China and Taiwan , but in the almost 20 years that birdwatching has been popular in Taiwan , this owl has been sighted very few times , and has always been regarded as rare .  
The game became popular in the Huangyen area of Zhejiang in the Taokuang reign ( 1821-1851 ) . The rules were as follows : First , the names of 34 famous people of old were written down . Then the game master would select one at random , and place it in a box . Then the players would bet which one it was , with the winner taking home 30 times the original wager .  
Q : Your book puts forward quite a few interesting observations . One of these was that certain illnesses are exclusive to Taiwan , such as " ghost phobia " and " taboo phobia . " Also , you observed that China 's historical phenomenon of communal speech-making seems similar to the modern group therapy sessions currently popular in the West .  
Folk popular , doctor disdainedBecause the Taiwanese medical establishment now follows mainstream Western medicine , many doctors say that hypnosis is " a mysterious art that is impossible to understand and hard to make sense of . " They regard such folk practices as spells , charms to calm people shocked by ghosts , and the trances of jitongs , as just plain superstitious and ridiculous . And as for meditation , yoga and Zen contemplation , these they view as the realm of religion , completely distinct from the domain of science .  
But these days , other products which have the same symbolic meaning - - like turtle-shaped patterns constructed out of canned food or made from mushrooms or day lilies - - are widely popular ; some people even just use cash as a substitute . And anyway , modern life is not suited to such ceremonies as the qigui . In the old days , after the ceremony the cakes would be divided up among the extended family and friends .  
Fifty years of a common destiny forged in fortune and misfortune have united us all into a closely bound and interdependent community . The first-ever popular presidential election has reconfirmed our collective consciousness that we in Taiwan have to work together as one . How to make this land of ours more beautiful and how to make its inhabitants feel safer and live a happier and more harmonious life is the common responsibility of our 21.3 million people !  
When Hsiu Ping-shan " retired " from politics , he drew inspiration from the recently popular " all-you-can-eat " restaurants to establish his own " all-you-can-write " center . The store is replete with brushes , ink , paper and ink stone , as well as exemplary calligraphy from all the great masters . Air conditioning and tea are provided , and a teacher even gives free instruction . Customers can arrive empty-handed and write to their hearts ' content .  
Xu Jiujing Rises in the Ranks of Officialdom , which was about the difficulties of being an honest official in the face of entrenched special interests , was popular on both Taiwan and the mainland . It too broke some artistic conventions in creating a lively character that combined two traditional Peking opera roles : the old man and the clown . ( photo by Hsu Pin )  
The stretch of highway known as Death Road , for its frequent fatal accidents , was laid out with many blind corners , but the popular account says that ghosts along that road are seeking souls to substitute for themselves . Physical sickness is explained as the result of contamination by something " unclean , " while all sorts of general problems are ascribed to the rousing of " evil demons . " Attaching every phenomenon to ghosts in this way does of course raise doubts .  
Later , so the story goes , when the Song dynasty gourmet and literary giant Su Dongpo was demoted and sent to serve as an official at Huanggang in Hubei Province , to satisfy his palate in that remote , impoverished place he used cheap local pork to make his own unique version of spice-stewed meat . His recipe was passed down and grew popular , and came to be known as Dongpo Meat ; it is considered one of his greatest " achievements in office . "  
It is said that in popular belief the Chinese narcissus , with its white petals and yellow cup , not only represents harmony of yin and yang and good fortune , but its likeness to a gold cup on a silver stand has always made it a symbol of wealth too . Who can say that it was not appropriate for the Tang emperor to use bowls made of precious metals and gems with their matching flowers of good omen as a gift for his beloved beauty ?  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
Because the theory of EQ includes a balanced , multifaceted educational perspective that emphasizes both the mental and physical aspects of individuals ' emotions , it has not only become popular among the population at large , but has also garnered considerable interest in the academic community , being seen as compatible with the call to educational reform .  
Haruyama 's philosophy in fact is simply a more rational form of a very popular current wave of thinking in Taiwan-the individualism of Taiwan 's so-called " new youth , " who refuse to get involved in the public sphere and who extol the idea that " as long as it makes me happy , there 's nothing wrong with it . "  
Over the years the HUF has prepared guided introductions to six trails , with the most popular being the Chihshan Rock Trail in Shihlin , which combines natural scenery with Class Two historic cultural artifacts . And since Mayor Chen Shui-bian declared that this trail would be made part of the city 's high school entrance exams , many dedicated parents have come here to collect informa - tion for their kids .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
The first book he ever bought himself was Stories from Chinese History . Later , when he studied at Chienkuo Boys High School , his happiest moments were browsing the second-hand book stores on Kuling Street with his classmates . This was a very popular place for literary youth of the 1960s and 70s to go . Reading books outside the main curriculum gave many people a rebellious or independent cast of mind , and cultivated many of today 's leading intellectuals and social elites .  
Taiwan composer Ma Shui-lung affirms Wong 's heartfelt efforts . But , purely from a musical point of view , he feels that the arrangements could be broader and deeper . Though it is great that popular tunes can be arranged to be more edifying without losing their common touch , it is also worth performing truly original works ; after all , the space for Chinese music is broad .  
In another situation , a performer in a flashy costume showed off his improved version of the once popular robot dance . Like a newly wound musical doll , he danced to the mechanical drum beats with an elated expression . Occasionally , he would interact with the tourists passing by , generating cheers as well as showers of coins .  
In recent years organically grown vegetables have become increasingly popular . " Wild " veggies , grown without depending on man-made fertilizers and not using pesticides , fit right in with this trend . Add to this the common belief that bitter tasting foods have medicinal value , and wild vegetables have become a new favorite for health-minded modern people .  
Recently natural wild plants have become popular foods in Taiwan , and aboriginal edible plants have become well-known in the process . However , edible plants account for only one-quarter of the plants used in daily life in Taniao village . Besides the necessities ( food , shelter , clothing ) , plants are essential materials for a huge number of other uses-medicine , landmarks , all kinds of tools used for outdoor work , rope , packaging , sandpaper , and cloth .  
The Daoists " assigned " those who attained immortality to beautiful Kunlun , and with the admixture of some popular imagination the Queen Mother of the West , who in ancient times had been a tribal leader , was also transformed from a hideous monster with a panther 's tail and tiger 's teeth into a beautiful woman in her thirties , ruling over the Fairyland of Kunlun .  
Lu Dongbin was a Tang-dynasty historical figure who trained himself in the Daoist arts in hopes of becoming an immortal . He has long since passed into popular lore as an immortal with a strong preference for the company of women . He is well-known for his flirtations with a famous courtesan , and for his frequent drunken revelry at the Yueyang Pavilion .  
For example , popular legend has it that the wood in coffin shops emits sounds , which are the souls of the deceased coming to choose their own coffins . Lin explains , with scientific basis , that the sound comes from the wood drying and splitting under the northeast seasonal winds , and is completely unrelated to spirits .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
The program proved extremely popular and was aired for a full two years . Many of the documentary films used were collected by John Hei on trips overseas , and sometimes the ROC military even borrowed such material for information purposes .  
Taiwan is working hard to attain diplomatic and economic breakthroughs and hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the West . Beset with ethnic and environmental problems , popular culture reigns supreme .  
The venerable history of weiqi can be traced to the Zhou dynasty ( 1122-255 BC ) . Over the following centuries it was mentioned in many verses , songs , and popular stories . Given the official endorsement by Confucius , and its immense popularity among the literati of the Han , Wei , and Six Dynasties , it gained a reputation as an activity suitable for refined persons , and it maintained an elegant image .  
They are the main theme of a series of works by Guatemalan painter Moises Barrios . In one work , a banana graces the cover of a popular magazine . Another painting parodies the work of Piet Mondrian , one of the most famous representatives of rationalism . Mondrian 's canvas with nothing but a single color divided by a few straight lines becomes a banana peel , with a few dark splotches here and there against a yellow background .  
Nanguan is most popular in Quanzhou , Xiamen , and the Minnan-speaking region in general . There is an elegant simplicity about it , and a hint of reserve . Its songs are soft , beautiful , and expressive , and contrast sharply with the brash , bold northern music often heard at weddings , funerals , and other such functions . Both types of music are very popular in southern Fujian and Taiwan .  
The Han dynasty was steeped in mythology , with popular and imaginative themes such as the legendary tale of how Wen Wang , the Zhou king , met with the Goddess of the West . These were often recorded in picture form , and famous engravers carved images from such stories onto tile and stone , using a dynamic , flowing style that continues to serve as inspiration for painters and sculptors to this day .  
Scholars of this period preferred to work directly from original material rather than plowing through heaps of derivative writings . For example , the Song literary lion Ouyang Xiu was especially fond of rubbings taken from the inscriptions on ancient bronzes , and epigraphy-the study of stone and bronze inscriptions-was popular as a way of coming into contact with the age of antiquity .  
After dinner there were further treats to pick up along the way , such as candied jujubes and sauce-stewed chicken and duck , as well as cold drinks such as ginger and honey cordial , sweet bean soup , purple perilla drink , and a sweat-inducing herbal beverage that was popular with the city 's pole-bearers as a form of " sports drink . "  
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 . Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history-Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh . It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  
They offer intense plots and dialogue and always feature attractive leading men and women . The photo shows mainland actress Zhao Wei ( left ) , who became popular throughout the Chinese world after starring in a Chiung Yao series , pictured with former child star Su You-peng of Taiwan . ( courtesy of Joy Production Corporation )  
To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud . But it is no exaggeration to say , as one mainland China cultural maven put it , " Television , film , and pop music are the main channels through which most ordinary people in mainland China have learned about external cultures since the Cultural Revolution . "  
Besides her natural vocal quality , the key to A-Mei 's success has been that her songs reflect feelings and aspirations of her era . In fact , when you look back at the history of popular cultural interchange between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , all the most successful singers and hit songs have been connected in some way to the hopes and feelings of the times .  
In 1979 , the famous singer of Hunan drama and member of the Central Music and Dance Company , Li Guyi , adopted Teng 's soft , breathy singing style to make the charming romantic ballad " Hometown Love . " This broke the long-term monopoly of using only folk or classical voice styles . Although the effort was subject to considerable official criticism , it was also widely popular .  
According to Zhang Weining , producer for the popular mainland singer Tian Zhen , " A-Mei 's performance style is suited to the outgoing , unrestrained character of the northern Chinese . " He feels that A-Mei is one of the few performers in pop music with a distinctive personal style .  
The idea of an imaginary miniature world become real is one that seemingly everyone has entertained at one time or another , and it has been represented in art in many ways . China has its bonsai , miniature rock gardens , calligraphy on grains of rice , and jewelry boxes . The West has its eggshell sculpture and model cars . And what could be more representative of miniaturized art than the dollhouses that are so popular in Europe , North America , and Japan ?  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
" Historical truth " is of course a fascinating topic of its own . While Biographical Literature has had an unmatched impact on contemporary historians , on popular interest in history , and in capturing the flavor of the past , there is at least one point worth wondering about : It has rarely published any material about Taiwan over the last 50 years , such as the stories of the opposition movement or of well-connected families like the Lins or Koos .  
On April 24 the National Assembly finalized the chief task of the sixth round of constitutional revisions during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency : its own demobilization . While this development will allay popular fears of an everlasting National Assembly , how to formulate comprehensive measures to fill in the constitutional and functional void of the moribund body becomes the next vital task .  
Huang Min-nan , who formerly headed pop music planning at Rock Records , says : " Buddhist music now changes several times a year . " Not so long ago Chinese-style symphonic music , or chanting accompanied by a single instrument was popular , but at the moment it 's all about " spiritual " music and dance tunes .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
Anything to lift us above the humdrum reality of daily life . It 's the same old story : events get embellished with every telling until they enter the realm of myth . For example , look how folklore has handled the characters of Zhuge Liang and Guan Gong . The historical record shows that the real Guan Gong did n't even have moustache , let alone the bushy beard that he 's now credited with in the popular imagination .  
First , he says , it 's not too far from Taipei , so it makes for a convenient daytrip for foreigners passing through Taipei . Second , the northeastern coastal area is a popular recreation corridor , with excellent places to see in Chinshan , Tanshui , Yangmingshan National Park , Yehliu , Keelung , and Ilan . Even before the museum was established , there was a ready-made stream of visitors passing through the area looking for worthwhile places to go .  
There were more rock concerts played by more local bands and attended by more fans than ever before in Taiwan this summer , and record companies have now had to introduce new categories for their CD output , such as pop bands , underground bands and live concerts . The most popular band at the moment , Mayday , this year sold 200,000 copies of its second album Long Live Love , which is a remarkable amount given the otherwise sluggish market .  
Love of money has been a constant across the ages , observable in such time-honored Chinese traditions as burning incense to pray to gods of wealth . Many Chinese wealth charms are traditional objects that have long been ascribed these powers . The three-legged toad , whose origins lie in a classic folktale , is an old favorite that has never fallen from popular favor .  
A legend dating back at least to the Han dynasty ( 206 BCE to 220 ) has it that the Yellow Emperor ( who supposedly reigned about 2600 BCE ) defeated his barbarian enemies by using a sacred amulet given to him by a heavenly messenger . This indicates that there was already popular belief in the efficacy of amulets as early as the Han . One ancient text claims that use of amulets in conjunction with the right herbs can even enable one to fly to the heavens and become invisible .  
While there are few examples of knights-errant with an overriding interest in justice , our recollection of one or two positive attributes dominates our image of these figures . The way we remember selfless Guo Jie and forget his more ruthless contemporaries is a case in point . When people feel oppressed , such idealization is still more common , and whenever China has been in decline the image of knight-errants has waxed bright in the popular mind .  
In fact , in any land and age , the human longing for a sense of security is likely to keep popular belief in astrology alive and kicking . But with the extremely high-powered telescopes that are trained on the skies today , heavenly bodies are no longer veiled in secrecy . One question that Chinese astronomers might do well to address is how to resurrect ancient Chinese astronomy and make it into more than just a quaint source of astro-babble among people wondering which zodiac signs make for a romantic match .  
Even when they only existed as a group in a comic book , they were already immensely popular idols . The members had different personalities , such as the low-key and gentle guy , the playboy who is really lonely at heart , and the stubborn yet passionate one . When these four idealized personality types were given form as tangible people ( or at least tangible actors ) , and they rescued the girl in the TV series from poverty , naturally the hearts of young girls in Taiwan never stood a chance .  
The resulting melange , sung in the local Minnan dialect , came to be known as gezai xi , or Taiwanese Opera , a very easy and enjoyable opera form that grew within 20 years into the most popular opera genre in Minnan-speaking areas . Troupes in Taiwan that had specialized in Beiguan , Gaojia , and Liyuan Opera switched over to Taiwanese Opera , and thanks to the close ties between Taiwan and Fujian , Taiwanese Opera took southern Fujian by storm in the 1920s and 30s .  
Little League baseball remains an inte-gral link in the memories all Taiwanese have of growing up . Professional baseball was also immensely popular for a time . However , in recent years , following regrettable incidents involving gambling and manipulation of players by local organized crime syndicates , baseball withered in the public 's fancy .  
At the time he finished primary school , there were still no music schools in Taiwan , so his parents , who ran a textiles company and were very supportive of his interest in music , sent him to Tokyo to study , giving no thought to the cost . They also hired well-known piano , voice and composition teachers to tutor him . With his teachers , Wen studied what were then thought of as the most elevated forms of music-Italian opera and English-language popular music .  
Cheng 's songs became popular in spite of not having been commercially distributed , demonstrating the resiliency that Taiwanese music has gained by being rooted in the hearts of the people . Although the major record labels are facing tough times and releasing fewer albums , many artists are still getting their work to the public through independent labels .  
Chu Bong-foo says he first conceived Cosmic Drifter in 1998 . The ideas came from his previously published Nine Essays On Intelligence , in which he discusses thought , human nature and value in terms of energy conversion , the formation of matter , the nature of time and space , and the evolution of the universe . But the essays ' content was dry and dull , and nobody understood it . Therefore he wanted to turn his theories into a popular novel that ordinary people would understand .  
The Dream of the Red Chamber , a classic from Chinese literature , has many examples of such verse in it that appeal to both refined and popular tastes . In chapter 28 , for example , Jia Baoyu and others feel that simply drinking to get drunk is dull , so they start a round of verse . Players are charged with using the characters for sadness , distraught , contented , and happiness to describe women in their verses .  
Although these two parties , the only legal minority parties at the time , played only a marginal role as " tokens " of democracy under Kuomintang authoritarianism , nonetheless thanks to the idealism of key members like Chiang Yun-tien and Kao Yu-shu , and to popular disaffection with the KMT , the CDSP remained active in local elections and constituted a force outside the KMT .  
Recently , various large hospitals have bowed to popular trends and are providing traditional therapeutic massage as an immensely successful " sideline . " Does this perhaps reflect an urgent need for stress-free tender loving care ?  
In the days before physiotherapy was generally accepted , it was very normal for people to seek out a " bonesetter " or tuina therapist in Chinese martial arts studios . He believes that many bonesetters are skilled , but he has also heard stories of people being injured in such treatment , and there is too large a gray area in popular tuina .  
Choreographers often take their inspiration for flamenco dances from the popular opera " Carmen , " which tells the tale of a gypsy girl . Oddly enough , flamenco is just the opposite of Western classical music in that the dark and moody music ( such as soleares ) is in a major key , while bulerias and other music in minor keys is up tempo .  
Fang notes that the firm 's target market remains professional women . Modern women require clothes that are highly functional and presentable , but also comfortable , practical and easy to clean . For example , knitwear that can be machine-washed is a product that is both popular and practical .  
Eight of the ten largest tourist agencies in Japan manage domestic tourism and depend solely on this market . Japan has managed the tourism industry with amazing skill . This is especially true for the hot springs areas popular with the silver-haired generation , where nature is combined with human artifice , places that can truly be described as " products of culture , " like the famous Hakone and Izu hot springs areas .  
There have long been radio stations-especially those that have a clearly defined regional identity and announcers with that down-home accent-which , after broadcasting a few popular songs , start in on sales pitches in fluent , authentic Taiwanese .

But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves .

This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .  
It is just that the popular will is like " flowing water " - it is changeable , now going one way , now another .

Yet no matter what political slogans may have declared , no matter how popular nostalgic soap operas about the mainland were or how authentic the cuisine remained , none of these things could overcome one basic fact-the two sides were separated for 40 years , during which there was no contact , families were separated , no one traveled to see the mainland 's famous scenery , and all we could know about what was going on behind the PRC 's " bamboo curtain " were shocking photographs of famine years .  
However , " although Chiang Wei-shui and others were found guilty in the Social Order and Police Incident , " writes Huang Huang-hsiung in his Chiang biography , " they indirectly benefited from this , because it became a focal point for the political and social movement .

Several of the most popular areas of research , such as the encroachment of Western imperialism on China , Christianity in China , Chinese political philosophy and the spread of education were all aimed at gaining a quick understanding of modern China , and areas not related to contemporary China were neglected .  
A task such as folding spirit money into ingots helps the surviving family gather together and work off their sad thoughts through a routine ritual . Furthermore , by performing a last helpful action for the loved one the survivors are eased of the painful feeling of not having done enough for them while there was still time . " These days burning spirit money is more popular in Taiwan than ever before . "  
Strawberry picking has become a popular leisure activity for city dwellers , and no doubt many people have picked the big red " Taoyuan No . 1 " strawberries at some pick-your-own strawberry farm . This strawberry was developed in Japan and a Japanese patent has been applied for . Local growers also used to carry plants away lock , stock and barrel after they 'd featured in Dutch exhibitions in Taiwan aimed at opening up the local flower market .  
After a bleak period lasting some years radio is back on its feet again , and facing the future with renewed optimism . Television is the chief adversary of radio among the broadcast media , but surveys reveal that the most popular radio presenter over the last two years has been Lo Hsiao-yun , whose program Intimate Listening airs six evenings a week from eight to ten o'clock - - which happens to be television 's prime time .  
Radio drama and other popular programs went into decline once TV began to air similar shows . From its peak in 1961 , radio listenership fell to an all-time low after the Chinese Television System hit the screens in 1971 . Not only did that familiar image of the family grouped around the radio set vanish , but one researcher at the time even found that many interviewees were unable to help with his survey for the simple reason that they never listened to radio at all .  
Whether or not a program being planned to pass on traditional performing arts to the younger generation becomes a reality will depend on receiving a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development . It 's worth noting that Yang Hsiu-ching and Yang Tzai-hsiung , a husband-and-wife team that has won a National Heritage Award for their achievements in Taiwanese shuo-ch'ang ( a form of popular entertainment featuring singing and comic dialogue ) and is considered a town treasure , have moved back to Hsichih after living elsewhere for many years .  
The best abacuses for everyday use have frames made from black sandalwood . More popular models use frames of compressed sawdust composite . The beads are fashioned from cherry wood imported from Japan .  
But one can discover from many popular stories that the Jade Emperor is buy no means beyond anger and fury , completely impersonal and objective , or able to see all the fine points clearly . On the contrary , He is quite " human , " and often becomes angry so that the common people suffer through no fault of their own , or listens to rumors and half-truths .  
Tradition has it that these three gods , dressed in full imperial attire , are transformations of the sacred emperors of old , Yao , Shun , and Yu . Their birthdays - - coming on the 15th day of the first , seventh , and tenth months of the year on the Chinese lunar calendar - - have an important status among customary popular celebrations .  
According to a survey done three years ago by Shao Li-fang , a lecturer at Shih Chien College , less than a third of unmarried people considered themselves " elite singles , " as a popular Chinese expression goes . Although most of them said they were content with their lot , half admitted they were lonely and missed having someone to take care of them .  
Add to this that modern people are more carefree about heirs , and also that medical advances have decreased concerns about having children at a later age ; and moreover it is more and more popular for the divorced or widowed to seek a second spring - - all these things mean that age is already not a crucial factor in deciding on whether it is appropriate to marry .  
This traditional " matchmaker " field , which one would have thought would have been wiped out by free choice in love and marriage , is not only alive and kicking ; in the last ten years it has experienced a complete turnaround to become a hot profession . Besides the matchmaking columns and programs popular in the media , an even greater number of specialized , commercialized " modern super matchmakers " are popping up everywhere .  
Hsiao Min , a Christian , says that every time the passage to a new year approaches , churches will print their own red envelopes , which congregants can use at no charge . Because propitious proverbs from the Bible have been imprinted on the set , they are very popular among the congregants , so that supply ca n't keep up with demand . Since they integrate traditional customs , they can also help the evangelical church spread and adapt to local conditions . "  
" Absorbing foreign myths is one of the special features of Chinese culture , " says Cheng Chih - ming , an associate professor in the Graduate School of Theology at Fu Jen University , who studies popular religion in Taiwan . For example there is the male deity Kuan Yin , who transformed into Princess Miaoshan , the beloved daughter of King Miaochuang , after coming to China , and from that transformed into Kuan Yin , the Goddess of Mercy .  
Before the discovery of the microscope , and before " ecological observation " became popular , when our ancestors saw these insects emerge from soft earth and light up , they imagined that the firefly was a metamorphosis from rotting leaves or decaying bamboo . The saying , " On summer nights , rotting grass turns into fireflies , " was a natural result of observing transformations as the weather changed from season to season .  
The most popular food for new mothers in Taiwan is sesame oil chicken . Chicken is the most digestible form of high-protein meat , while sesame oil is rich in vitamin E , calcium and iron and is said to help the uterus contract and eliminate lochia , or the discharge of blood , tissue and mucus after childbirth . The two main seasonings in sesame oil chicken - - ginger and rice wine - - are supposed to remove cold from the body and stimulate circulation .  
It 's got a strong smell when you 're eating it , and it 's packed with flavor too . The steamed stinky tofu in Chekiang restaurants is also very popular . It can be mixed with green beans or hot sauce and other flavorings .  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
If it is true that in popular fashion " there is no such thing as absolute rebellion or subversion " and that anti-social and counter-cultural behavior will ultimately be co-opted by the mainstream , then flashy protest can only bring fleeting personal pleasure and has no real function in terms of bringing about social change . Moreover , gender performance can only be done for performance 's sake .  
Some people have criticized Tsui Hark 's Huang Fei-hong as " superficial " and lacking the real martial skills of a great master . The constant use of ropes , of special effects which go beyond the humanly and physically possible , and of speededup action , the all-pervading Chinese popular aesthetic , the dramatic camera angles , the melodramatic dialogues and plot development , create an overall effect which is " very exciting , " but the special qualities of the main character Huang Fei-hong become rather blurred .  
In terms of meteorological significance , Solar Terms can at most indicate ' the most probable period of sunlight , ' " states Wu Ming-chin . If the weather is favorable , planting according to the Solar Terms will yield the most abundant harvest . Luckily , the Solar Terms are still quite popular among farmers , who are not accustomed to calculating so precisely .  
Asia is their homeAs an object of research , the tawny fish owl is less dangerous than the Formosan black bear , and not as rare as the now extinct clouded leopard . The tawny fish owl is found in India , mainland China and Taiwan , but in the almost 20 years that birdwatching has been popular in Taiwan , this owl has been sighted very few times , and has always been regarded as rare .  
The game became popular in the Huangyen area of Zhejiang in the Taokuang reign ( 1821-1851 ) . The rules were as follows : First , the names of 34 famous people of old were written down . Then the game master would select one at random , and place it in a box . Then the players would bet which one it was , with the winner taking home 30 times the original wager .  
Q : Your book puts forward quite a few interesting observations . One of these was that certain illnesses are exclusive to Taiwan , such as " ghost phobia " and " taboo phobia . " Also , you observed that China 's historical phenomenon of communal speech-making seems similar to the modern group therapy sessions currently popular in the West .  
Folk popular , doctor disdainedBecause the Taiwanese medical establishment now follows mainstream Western medicine , many doctors say that hypnosis is " a mysterious art that is impossible to understand and hard to make sense of . " They regard such folk practices as spells , charms to calm people shocked by ghosts , and the trances of jitongs , as just plain superstitious and ridiculous . And as for meditation , yoga and Zen contemplation , these they view as the realm of religion , completely distinct from the domain of science .  
But these days , other products which have the same symbolic meaning - - like turtle-shaped patterns constructed out of canned food or made from mushrooms or day lilies - - are widely popular ; some people even just use cash as a substitute . And anyway , modern life is not suited to such ceremonies as the qigui . In the old days , after the ceremony the cakes would be divided up among the extended family and friends .  
Fifty years of a common destiny forged in fortune and misfortune have united us all into a closely bound and interdependent community . The first-ever popular presidential election has reconfirmed our collective consciousness that we in Taiwan have to work together as one . How to make this land of ours more beautiful and how to make its inhabitants feel safer and live a happier and more harmonious life is the common responsibility of our 21.3 million people !  
When Hsiu Ping-shan " retired " from politics , he drew inspiration from the recently popular " all-you-can-eat " restaurants to establish his own " all-you-can-write " center . The store is replete with brushes , ink , paper and ink stone , as well as exemplary calligraphy from all the great masters . Air conditioning and tea are provided , and a teacher even gives free instruction . Customers can arrive empty-handed and write to their hearts ' content .  
Xu Jiujing Rises in the Ranks of Officialdom , which was about the difficulties of being an honest official in the face of entrenched special interests , was popular on both Taiwan and the mainland . It too broke some artistic conventions in creating a lively character that combined two traditional Peking opera roles : the old man and the clown . ( photo by Hsu Pin )  
The stretch of highway known as Death Road , for its frequent fatal accidents , was laid out with many blind corners , but the popular account says that ghosts along that road are seeking souls to substitute for themselves . Physical sickness is explained as the result of contamination by something " unclean , " while all sorts of general problems are ascribed to the rousing of " evil demons . " Attaching every phenomenon to ghosts in this way does of course raise doubts .  
Later , so the story goes , when the Song dynasty gourmet and literary giant Su Dongpo was demoted and sent to serve as an official at Huanggang in Hubei Province , to satisfy his palate in that remote , impoverished place he used cheap local pork to make his own unique version of spice-stewed meat . His recipe was passed down and grew popular , and came to be known as Dongpo Meat ; it is considered one of his greatest " achievements in office . "  
It is said that in popular belief the Chinese narcissus , with its white petals and yellow cup , not only represents harmony of yin and yang and good fortune , but its likeness to a gold cup on a silver stand has always made it a symbol of wealth too . Who can say that it was not appropriate for the Tang emperor to use bowls made of precious metals and gems with their matching flowers of good omen as a gift for his beloved beauty ?  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
Because the theory of EQ includes a balanced , multifaceted educational perspective that emphasizes both the mental and physical aspects of individuals ' emotions , it has not only become popular among the population at large , but has also garnered considerable interest in the academic community , being seen as compatible with the call to educational reform .  
Haruyama 's philosophy in fact is simply a more rational form of a very popular current wave of thinking in Taiwan-the individualism of Taiwan 's so-called " new youth , " who refuse to get involved in the public sphere and who extol the idea that " as long as it makes me happy , there 's nothing wrong with it . "  
Over the years the HUF has prepared guided introductions to six trails , with the most popular being the Chihshan Rock Trail in Shihlin , which combines natural scenery with Class Two historic cultural artifacts . And since Mayor Chen Shui-bian declared that this trail would be made part of the city 's high school entrance exams , many dedicated parents have come here to collect informa - tion for their kids .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
The first book he ever bought himself was Stories from Chinese History . Later , when he studied at Chienkuo Boys High School , his happiest moments were browsing the second-hand book stores on Kuling Street with his classmates . This was a very popular place for literary youth of the 1960s and 70s to go . Reading books outside the main curriculum gave many people a rebellious or independent cast of mind , and cultivated many of today 's leading intellectuals and social elites .  
Taiwan composer Ma Shui-lung affirms Wong 's heartfelt efforts . But , purely from a musical point of view , he feels that the arrangements could be broader and deeper . Though it is great that popular tunes can be arranged to be more edifying without losing their common touch , it is also worth performing truly original works ; after all , the space for Chinese music is broad .  
In another situation , a performer in a flashy costume showed off his improved version of the once popular robot dance . Like a newly wound musical doll , he danced to the mechanical drum beats with an elated expression . Occasionally , he would interact with the tourists passing by , generating cheers as well as showers of coins .  
In recent years organically grown vegetables have become increasingly popular . " Wild " veggies , grown without depending on man-made fertilizers and not using pesticides , fit right in with this trend . Add to this the common belief that bitter tasting foods have medicinal value , and wild vegetables have become a new favorite for health-minded modern people .  
Recently natural wild plants have become popular foods in Taiwan , and aboriginal edible plants have become well-known in the process . However , edible plants account for only one-quarter of the plants used in daily life in Taniao village . Besides the necessities ( food , shelter , clothing ) , plants are essential materials for a huge number of other uses-medicine , landmarks , all kinds of tools used for outdoor work , rope , packaging , sandpaper , and cloth .  
The Daoists " assigned " those who attained immortality to beautiful Kunlun , and with the admixture of some popular imagination the Queen Mother of the West , who in ancient times had been a tribal leader , was also transformed from a hideous monster with a panther 's tail and tiger 's teeth into a beautiful woman in her thirties , ruling over the Fairyland of Kunlun .  
Lu Dongbin was a Tang-dynasty historical figure who trained himself in the Daoist arts in hopes of becoming an immortal . He has long since passed into popular lore as an immortal with a strong preference for the company of women . He is well-known for his flirtations with a famous courtesan , and for his frequent drunken revelry at the Yueyang Pavilion .  
For example , popular legend has it that the wood in coffin shops emits sounds , which are the souls of the deceased coming to choose their own coffins . Lin explains , with scientific basis , that the sound comes from the wood drying and splitting under the northeast seasonal winds , and is completely unrelated to spirits .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
The program proved extremely popular and was aired for a full two years . Many of the documentary films used were collected by John Hei on trips overseas , and sometimes the ROC military even borrowed such material for information purposes .  
Taiwan is working hard to attain diplomatic and economic breakthroughs and hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the West . Beset with ethnic and environmental problems , popular culture reigns supreme .  
The venerable history of weiqi can be traced to the Zhou dynasty ( 1122-255 BC ) . Over the following centuries it was mentioned in many verses , songs , and popular stories . Given the official endorsement by Confucius , and its immense popularity among the literati of the Han , Wei , and Six Dynasties , it gained a reputation as an activity suitable for refined persons , and it maintained an elegant image .  
They are the main theme of a series of works by Guatemalan painter Moises Barrios . In one work , a banana graces the cover of a popular magazine . Another painting parodies the work of Piet Mondrian , one of the most famous representatives of rationalism . Mondrian 's canvas with nothing but a single color divided by a few straight lines becomes a banana peel , with a few dark splotches here and there against a yellow background .  
Nanguan is most popular in Quanzhou , Xiamen , and the Minnan-speaking region in general . There is an elegant simplicity about it , and a hint of reserve . Its songs are soft , beautiful , and expressive , and contrast sharply with the brash , bold northern music often heard at weddings , funerals , and other such functions . Both types of music are very popular in southern Fujian and Taiwan .  
The Han dynasty was steeped in mythology , with popular and imaginative themes such as the legendary tale of how Wen Wang , the Zhou king , met with the Goddess of the West . These were often recorded in picture form , and famous engravers carved images from such stories onto tile and stone , using a dynamic , flowing style that continues to serve as inspiration for painters and sculptors to this day .  
Scholars of this period preferred to work directly from original material rather than plowing through heaps of derivative writings . For example , the Song literary lion Ouyang Xiu was especially fond of rubbings taken from the inscriptions on ancient bronzes , and epigraphy-the study of stone and bronze inscriptions-was popular as a way of coming into contact with the age of antiquity .  
After dinner there were further treats to pick up along the way , such as candied jujubes and sauce-stewed chicken and duck , as well as cold drinks such as ginger and honey cordial , sweet bean soup , purple perilla drink , and a sweat-inducing herbal beverage that was popular with the city 's pole-bearers as a form of " sports drink . "  
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 . Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history-Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh . It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  
They offer intense plots and dialogue and always feature attractive leading men and women . The photo shows mainland actress Zhao Wei ( left ) , who became popular throughout the Chinese world after starring in a Chiung Yao series , pictured with former child star Su You-peng of Taiwan .

To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud . But it is no exaggeration to say , as one mainland China cultural maven put it , " Television , film , and pop music are the main channels through which most ordinary people in mainland China have learned about external cultures since the Cultural Revolution . "  
Besides her natural vocal quality , the key to A-Mei 's success has been that her songs reflect feelings and aspirations of her era . In fact , when you look back at the history of popular cultural interchange between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , all the most successful singers and hit songs have been connected in some way to the hopes and feelings of the times .  
In 1979 , the famous singer of Hunan drama and member of the Central Music and Dance Company , Li Guyi , adopted Teng 's soft , breathy singing style to make the charming romantic ballad " Hometown Love . " This broke the long-term monopoly of using only folk or classical voice styles . Although the effort was subject to considerable official criticism , it was also widely popular .  
According to Zhang Weining , producer for the popular mainland singer Tian Zhen , " A-Mei 's performance style is suited to the outgoing , unrestrained character of the northern Chinese . " He feels that A-Mei is one of the few performers in pop music with a distinctive personal style .  
The idea of an imaginary miniature world become real is one that seemingly everyone has entertained at one time or another , and it has been represented in art in many ways . China has its bonsai , miniature rock gardens , calligraphy on grains of rice , and jewelry boxes . The West has its eggshell sculpture and model cars . And what could be more representative of miniaturized art than the dollhouses that are so popular in Europe , North America , and Japan ?  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
" Historical truth " is of course a fascinating topic of its own . While Biographical Literature has had an unmatched impact on contemporary historians , on popular interest in history , and in capturing the flavor of the past , there is at least one point worth wondering about : It has rarely published any material about Taiwan over the last 50 years , such as the stories of the opposition movement or of well-connected families like the Lins or Koos .  
On April 24 the National Assembly finalized the chief task of the sixth round of constitutional revisions during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency : its own demobilization . While this development will allay popular fears of an everlasting National Assembly , how to formulate comprehensive measures to fill in the constitutional and functional void of the moribund body becomes the next vital task .  
Huang Min-nan , who formerly headed pop music planning at Rock Records , says : " Buddhist music now changes several times a year . " Not so long ago Chinese-style symphonic music , or chanting accompanied by a single instrument was popular , but at the moment it 's all about " spiritual " music and dance tunes .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
Anything to lift us above the humdrum reality of daily life . It 's the same old story : events get embellished with every telling until they enter the realm of myth . For example , look how folklore has handled the characters of Zhuge Liang and Guan Gong . The historical record shows that the real Guan Gong did n't even have moustache , let alone the bushy beard that he 's now credited with in the popular imagination .  
First , he says , it 's not too far from Taipei , so it makes for a convenient daytrip for foreigners passing through Taipei . Second , the northeastern coastal area is a popular recreation corridor , with excellent places to see in Chinshan , Tanshui , Yangmingshan National Park , Yehliu , Keelung , and Ilan . Even before the museum was established , there was a ready-made stream of visitors passing through the area looking for worthwhile places to go .  
There were more rock concerts played by more local bands and attended by more fans than ever before in Taiwan this summer , and record companies have now had to introduce new categories for their CD output , such as pop bands , underground bands and live concerts . The most popular band at the moment , Mayday , this year sold 200,000 copies of its second album Long Live Love , which is a remarkable amount given the otherwise sluggish market .  
Love of money has been a constant across the ages , observable in such time-honored Chinese traditions as burning incense to pray to gods of wealth . Many Chinese wealth charms are traditional objects that have long been ascribed these powers . The three-legged toad , whose origins lie in a classic folktale , is an old favorite that has never fallen from popular favor .  
A legend dating back at least to the Han dynasty ( 206 BCE to 220 ) has it that the Yellow Emperor ( who supposedly reigned about 2600 BCE ) defeated his barbarian enemies by using a sacred amulet given to him by a heavenly messenger . This indicates that there was already popular belief in the efficacy of amulets as early as the Han . One ancient text claims that use of amulets in conjunction with the right herbs can even enable one to fly to the heavens and become invisible .  
While there are few examples of knights-errant with an overriding interest in justice , our recollection of one or two positive attributes dominates our image of these figures . The way we remember selfless Guo Jie and forget his more ruthless contemporaries is a case in point . When people feel oppressed , such idealization is still more common , and whenever China has been in decline the image of knight-errants has waxed bright in the popular mind .  
In fact , in any land and age , the human longing for a sense of security is likely to keep popular belief in astrology alive and kicking . But with the extremely high-powered telescopes that are trained on the skies today , heavenly bodies are no longer veiled in secrecy . One question that Chinese astronomers might do well to address is how to resurrect ancient Chinese astronomy and make it into more than just a quaint source of astro-babble among people wondering which zodiac signs make for a romantic match .  
Even when they only existed as a group in a comic book , they were already immensely popular idols . The members had different personalities , such as the low-key and gentle guy , the playboy who is really lonely at heart , and the stubborn yet passionate one . When these four idealized personality types were given form as tangible people ( or at least tangible actors ) , and they rescued the girl in the TV series from poverty , naturally the hearts of young girls in Taiwan never stood a chance .  
The resulting melange , sung in the local Minnan dialect , came to be known as gezai xi , or Taiwanese Opera , a very easy and enjoyable opera form that grew within 20 years into the most popular opera genre in Minnan-speaking areas . Troupes in Taiwan that had specialized in Beiguan , Gaojia , and Liyuan Opera switched over to Taiwanese Opera , and thanks to the close ties between Taiwan and Fujian , Taiwanese Opera took southern Fujian by storm in the 1920s and 30s .  
Little League baseball remains an inte-gral link in the memories all Taiwanese have of growing up . Professional baseball was also immensely popular for a time . However , in recent years , following regrettable incidents involving gambling and manipulation of players by local organized crime syndicates , baseball withered in the public 's fancy .  
At the time he finished primary school , there were still no music schools in Taiwan , so his parents , who ran a textiles company and were very supportive of his interest in music , sent him to Tokyo to study , giving no thought to the cost . They also hired well-known piano , voice and composition teachers to tutor him . With his teachers , Wen studied what were then thought of as the most elevated forms of music-Italian opera and English-language popular music .  
Cheng 's songs became popular in spite of not having been commercially distributed , demonstrating the resiliency that Taiwanese music has gained by being rooted in the hearts of the people . Although the major record labels are facing tough times and releasing fewer albums , many artists are still getting their work to the public through independent labels .  
Chu Bong-foo says he first conceived Cosmic Drifter in 1998 . The ideas came from his previously published Nine Essays On Intelligence , in which he discusses thought , human nature and value in terms of energy conversion , the formation of matter , the nature of time and space , and the evolution of the universe . But the essays ' content was dry and dull , and nobody understood it . Therefore he wanted to turn his theories into a popular novel that ordinary people would understand .  
The Dream of the Red Chamber , a classic from Chinese literature , has many examples of such verse in it that appeal to both refined and popular tastes . In chapter 28 , for example , Jia Baoyu and others feel that simply drinking to get drunk is dull , so they start a round of verse . Players are charged with using the characters for sadness , distraught , contented , and happiness to describe women in their verses .  
Although these two parties , the only legal minority parties at the time , played only a marginal role as " tokens " of democracy under Kuomintang authoritarianism , nonetheless thanks to the idealism of key members like Chiang Yun-tien and Kao Yu-shu , and to popular disaffection with the KMT , the CDSP remained active in local elections and constituted a force outside the KMT .  
Recently , various large hospitals have bowed to popular trends and are providing traditional therapeutic massage as an immensely successful " sideline . " Does this perhaps reflect an urgent need for stress-free tender loving care ?  
In the days before physiotherapy was generally accepted , it was very normal for people to seek out a " bonesetter " or tuina therapist in Chinese martial arts studios . He believes that many bonesetters are skilled , but he has also heard stories of people being injured in such treatment , and there is too large a gray area in popular tuina .  
Choreographers often take their inspiration for flamenco dances from the popular opera " Carmen , " which tells the tale of a gypsy girl . Oddly enough , flamenco is just the opposite of Western classical music in that the dark and moody music ( such as soleares ) is in a major key , while bulerias and other music in minor keys is up tempo .  
Fang notes that the firm 's target market remains professional women . Modern women require clothes that are highly functional and presentable , but also comfortable , practical and easy to clean . For example , knitwear that can be machine-washed is a product that is both popular and practical .  
Eight of the ten largest tourist agencies in Japan manage domestic tourism and depend solely on this market . Japan has managed the tourism industry with amazing skill . This is especially true for the hot springs areas popular with the silver-haired generation , where nature is combined with human artifice , places that can truly be described as " products of culture , " like the famous Hakone and Izu hot springs areas .  
There have long been radio stations-especially those that have a clearly defined regional identity and announcers with that down-home accent-which , after broadcasting a few popular songs , start in on sales pitches in fluent , authentic Taiwanese . These shows are especially attractive to elderly listeners in rural areas .  
But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves . As a whole , mainland writers are either concerned with popular urban lit or more focused on their own high personal expectations about their work . Few are candidates to write popular motivational books , let alone take long tours around the country to publicize these books .  
The works of Han Han are most representative of this genre and are very popular with younger readers . When he was 16 , Han Han became an overnight sensation with the publication of his novel Three Doors . Not academically inclined , he decided against attending Fudan University in Shanghai after graduating from high school . The rebellious nature of his books brings to mind Refusing to Take the Joint Entrance Exam , which was written by Wu Hsiang-hui in Taiwan two decades earlier .  
In terms of agreement , both sides realize that although democratic government is essentially " representative government , " duly elected representatives and officials are sometimes unable to carry out fully and impartially the duties entrusted to them by the electorate . To correct the insufficiencies of " indirect democracy " one must thus rely on the " direct democracy " of the popular referendum . This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .  
It is just that the popular will is like " flowing water " - it is changeable , now going one way , now another . In today 's Taiwan , where there is still plenty of room for improvement in democratic institutions and where there still exist great differences on the question of national identity , both sides must proceed cautiously .
