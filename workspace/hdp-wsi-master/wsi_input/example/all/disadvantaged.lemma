To be more specific , the interaction between these diverse values and theories - - liberalists ' pursuit of democracy , personal freedom and enlightenment ; neo-conservatives ' affirmation of the need for political order and stability in the course of modernization and development ; and the New Left 's concern for the interests of the disadvantaged at the grassroots - - plays a positive practical role in safeguarding the sound and rational development of a society and in bringing about a more balanced society through checks and balances .  
At this year 's " two sessions , " the government has proposed that " full consideration should be given to the people 's capability of adapting themselves to the reform while carrying out reforms , and the expenses originally borne by the state and social institutions can not be shifted to the people . "  The government has also emphasized that the basic living standards of the disadvantaged people should be guaranteed , and a social security system should be established and improved .  NPC deputies and CPPCC members have recognized this .

Dr Yeoh noted that apart from a safety net for the needy , the vulnerable and the disadvantaged , there was a range of preventive , developmental and support services , as well as remedial services for those who required assistance .  These include services for the elderly , the family , the youth , and the disabled .  
The Government is fully committed to providing quality welfare services for those in need .  There is now in place a safety net for the needy , the vulnerable and the disadvantaged .  In addition , there is a range of preventive , developmental and support services , as well as remedial services for those who are vulnerable and require such assistance .  These include services for the elderly , the family , the youth , and the disabled .  
Following from the social philosophy and the four pillars I have just mentioned , the Government in the past five and a half years has put in a lot of resources and efforts to provide care and assistance for the physical and psychosocial well-being of the elderly , and to assist the disadvantaged , the poor and the unemployed with an emphasis on enhancing , not impeding , their will to self-reliance . 
The motion , to be moved by Hon Frederick FUNG , says " That , as the Government will introduce very shortly a new charging scheme for public health care services and , in parallel , enhance the existing medical fee waiver mechanism , this Council urges the Government to relax the eligibility criteria under the mechanism so as to benefit more people from the socially disadvantaged groups , such as elderly persons , low-income earners and chronic patients . "  
This is why many people take the view that just at the basic spirit behind the children 's welfare law is that children have self-esteem and need to be respected by adults , wild animals involved in the workings of human society also need people to fight for their most basic right " not to be subjected to mental terror or physical abuse , " in the same way that disadvantaged groups in society are protected .  
The disadvantaged of the disadvantagedAustralia 's public television has a regular program displaying government-sponsored documentaries which are filmed by their indigenous peoples . In the United States , many reservations have community programs produced and hosted by native Americans . But Taiwan 's public television news department is recruiting reporters whose aboriginal identity is a prerequisite . This is a rarity not only in Taiwan ; throughout the whole world it would be hard to find a comparable experience .  
Many elderly people who were unable to collect their subsidies ended up accusing the staff of being obstructionist . Moreover , beginning next year the central government will no longer compensate local governments for hiring social workers . It is likely that after many social workers leave their positions , the work of visiting and protecting the handicapped , women , children , and other disadvantaged groups will grind to an even slower pace .  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
With many of Taiwan 's wild animals having become " disadvantaged groups " or having even been driven to the verge of extinction by pressure from human development , it became a matter of necessity to pass the Wildlife Conservation Law to protect endemic and rare species . But at the same time , previously unknown species of tree frogs , shrews , bats , spiders and many other animals which , though unfamiliar , enrich the list of Taiwan 's endemic species , have recently been " discovered " in the wild .  
" Having aboriginal peoples making their own videos involves the problem of interpretation , " says documentary maker Li Tao-ming . In the past , outsiders often arrived with preconceived dichotomies like " mainstream vs . non-mainstream , or privileged vs . disadvantaged . They saw themselves as being in charge of the documentary effort , of being at a higher level than the subjects . This type of thinking must be smashed .  
Indeed , as far as he is concerned , " It seems like the film makers were all being ' politically correct , ' acting as if documentaries were only good for filming ' disadvantaged ' groups in society . These subjects and people inevitably become documentary material , and the film makers just use them because they make easy subject matter , " says Wang with sharp frankness .  
However , Chen Shui-bian 's iron fist in dealing with illegal video game arcades , the razing of illegal structures and actions against the sex industry and licensed prostitutes , as well as his constant disputes with the city council , led to growing opposition from interested parties and groups representing the disadvantaged . This in turn meant that many voters had reservations about the rough-and-tumble style of their first elected mayor .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media . When a female postal worker complained of discriminatory testing , and a young man suffered constant harassment by tax authorities after his ID card was used for someone else 's tax file , Chang took their cases to administrative authorities for the fair treatment they deserved . In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .  
Within three to six months of the end of the provisional session , the KMT plans to have completed a full review of party membership . Then there will be a direct election for the party chairman next June . In addition , in future special quotas will be set aside for youth , women , and disadvantaged groups to hold a total of 40% of the seats in party congresses , the Central Committee , and the CSC .  
In the sexual spectrum , there is a wide range of colors . To divide male and female into two extreme categories of masculine and feminine would make us unable to understand and appreciate disadvantaged groups . "  
Another and most troubling phenomenon for researchers is that as a self-supporting economic unit caring for the elderly and looking after children , the number of economically disadvantaged families has increased in recent years , and the gap between rich and poor households has widened .  
Society sighs and shakes it collective head at this subgroup , which consists of disadvantaged individuals , often unemployed and / or single parents , stuck on the lower rungs both socially and economically . When faced with injustice or adversity , they often do not know how to express their emotions or where to seek help . These lonely , helpless , marginalized individuals are most vulnerable to anger-whether as its wielders or its victims .  
Programmes for disadvantaged or vulnerable groups , in addition to reflecting a true understanding of the underlying problems of each group , must pass the test of being both equitable and efficient .  
Promoting the socioeconomic status of disadvantaged ethnic , cultural , occupational or religious groups is also difficult owing to a lack of effective and acceptable means of intervention .  
That approach seeks to ensure that the basic needs of the poor , disadvantaged and vulnerable are addressed , that communities are empowered and that natural resources are managed and used in an optimal manner .  
Much productive work of great social importance is not remunerated , such as caring for children and the elderly , protecting the environment and providing voluntary assistance to vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals and groups .  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
Ensure that disadvantaged and vulnerable persons and groups are included in social development , and that society acknowledges and responds to the consequences of disability by securing the legal rights of the individual and by making the physical and social environment accessible ;  
Promoting enterprise and productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule based international trading system and technologies for all people , particularly those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as the least developed countries ;  
Implementing measures to open market opportunities for all , especially people living in poverty and the disadvantaged , and to encourage individuals and communities to take economic initiatives , innovate and invest in activities that contribute to social development while promoting broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Access to credit by small rural or urban producers , landless farmers and other people with low or no income should be substantially improved , with special attention to the needs of women , and disadvantaged and vulnerable groups by :  
The legal system should be made more sensitive and responsive to the needs and special circumstances of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , to ensure the strong and independent administration of justice ;  
Such an inclusive society must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Supporting by legislation , incentives and other means , where appropriate , organizations of the vulnerable and disadvantaged groups so that they may promote the interests of the groups concerned and become involved in local and national , economic , social and political decision-making that guides society as a whole ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Ensure that structural adjustment programmes are so designed as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and communities , while ensuring their positive effects on such groups and communities by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities and devising measures to ensure that they gain access to and control over economic resources and economic and social activities ; actions should be taken to reduce inequality and economic disparity ;  
All parties involved in the development process , including academic institutions , non-governmental organizations and grass-roots and women 's groups , should mobilize to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes directed towards the poorest and most disadvantaged groups of women , such as rural and indigenous women , female heads of households , young women and older women , refugees and migrant women and women with disabilities .  
Enhance the access of disadvantaged women , including women entrepreneurs , in rural , remote and urban areas to financial services through strengthening links between the formal banks and intermediary lending organizations , including legislative support , training for women and institutional strengthening for intermediary institutions with a view to mobilizing capital for those institutions and increasing the availability of credit ;  
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed so as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to ensure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
In addition to selecting schools to be upgraded or built , the issue of equity between regions and genders should be assessed , with studies on selected policy matters , such as reducing imbalances for disadvantaged groups and increasing internal efficiency , in order to enable policy makers to make decisions based on in-depth analyses of local conditions and on comparative analysis of countries facing similar problems .  
Ensure universal and equal access to and completion of primary education by all children and eliminate the existing gap between girls and boys , as stipulated in article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ; 10 / similarly , ensure equal access to secondary education by the year 2005 and equal access to higher education , including vocational and technical education , for all girls and boys , including the disadvantaged and gifted ; 
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to assure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
Finally , how to intervene most effectively has to be judged - through economic policy instruments , legal reform , law enforcement , intergovernmental cooperation , political , administrative or judicial discretion , education policies , research and development policies , technology development and dissemination , or empowerment of particular geographical or disadvantaged social groups , such as indigenous people , minorities and women .  
In 1991 , the Bank issued a revised policy ( Operational Directive 4.20 ) , which extends the definition of indigenous peoples to include a much wider array of groups who maintain social and cultural identities distinct from those of the national societies in which they live , who have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and who are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
Promotes regional and subregional cooperation on modalities for addressing critical issues faced by disadvantaged groups in societies undergoing rapid change , with particular consideration to technical cooperation among developing countries through the organization of national and subregional training workshops and field study-cum-seminar programmes ;  
Access for all to the values , knowledge and skills imparted by the educational system is a prerequisite for ensuring the continuity and stability of democratic institutions , guaranteeing political , economic , social and cultural participation , especially on the part of the most disadvantaged groups and contributing to the fight against poverty .  
Some claim to have been denied housing because they are not associated with successful political parties or because they were orphans , refugees or other disadvantaged people who returned to the city or town too late , or were too powerless , to secure access to free housing in premises abandoned by their former owners .  
The Government also described the general legislative measures taken to eliminate racial discrimination in education , the special measures taken to ensure equality and to help the economically disadvantaged , and pointed out its commitment to the goal of providing access to general education for all children , funded by the State at an acceptable level of quality . 
most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports .

that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
With its financial resources and groups of experts , the United Nations system can assist the countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts for timely regional and global integration , in the context of an economic , trade , scientific and technological race on a global scale .  
The desire to ensure effective democratization in national life and to foster development is at the core of the activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to benefit children , young people , women , indigenous and rural populations , the disabled and certain particularly disadvantaged urban groups .  
We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
In addition , the problems of persistent poverty , increasing unemployment , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , environmental degradation , drug abuse and drug trafficking , crime , terrorism and social disintegration have combined to present a formidable array of challenges , which , if left unaddressed , threaten to overwhelm us and further marginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us . 
Stresses that Governments , in partnership with civil society and all other development actors , including non-governmental organizations and people living in poverty and their organizations should cooperate to meet the basic human needs of all - inter alia , income , resources , education , health care , nutrition , shelter , sanitation and safe water - in particular of people living in poverty and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups ;  
Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
[ Depending on local conditions in the housing sector and the availability of legal protection guaranteeing equal access to resources and opportunities , ] vulnerable groups include the poorest groups , some of the older persons , street children , youth , [ documented ] migrants , internally displaced persons , inhabitants of disadvantaged communities , people affected by natural and human-caused disasters , households headed by women , persons with disabilities and some indigenous people .  
( a bis ) Support , through legislation , incentives and other means , where appropriate , organizations of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups so that they may promote their interests and become involved in local and national economic , social and political decision-making ;  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
The legal system should be made more sensitive and responsive to the needs and special circumstances of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in order to ensure a strong and independent administration of justice ;  
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy . 
Cooperatively structured community enterprises are an effective organizational means whereby grass-roots initiative and both public and private funds can be combined in order to revitalize disadvantaged communities without creating dependency .  
We agree to support ongoing and new creative partnerships , recognizing that indigenous people , youth and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups possess in common the potential for diverse realization of full human development .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
In 1991 , the World Bank issued a revised policy which extends its own definition of indigenous people to include a much wider array of groups that maintain cultural and social identities distinct from those of the national societies where they live , have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
It was mentioned that the Centre was also committed to protecting and maintaining the historic , cultural and natural heritage of indigenous and other people , and that Governments , as enabling partners , should create and strengthen effective partnerships with vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities .  
The Committee , while recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the collection of data , is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to collect disaggregated data on the situation of all children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including black children , disabled children , street children , children placed in institutions , including institutions of a penal nature , ill-treated and abused children or children from economically disadvantaged groups , which constitutes a major obstacle to the effective and full implementation of the provisions of the Convention .  
The Committee also recommends that further measures be taken to gather systematic quantitative and qualitative data , disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , colour , rural / urban and social origin , on all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children , particularly the most disadvantaged groups .  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , and children who are forced to live and / or work in the streets in order to survive .  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
These are to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and the building of ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
However , the economic and cultural poverty of the most disadvantaged is a fertile breeding _ ground for the development of religious extremism and , more generally , for the political exploitation of religion ; this is evidenced by the conflicts in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the destruction of Babri Masjid and the intercommunal riots in Bombay .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , in institutions , or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , children belonging to minority groups , especially Roma , and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
There is little question that their social and economic potential is enormous , but so too are the risks that those without the capabilities to design , produce and use the new products and service applications may be disadvantaged or excluded from participating actively in their local communities and in the global information society .  
There is an urgent need to increase economic incentives for sustainable development based on full and comprehensive pricing that reflects all economic , social and environmental externalities , with targeted and explicit subsidies , where necessary , to prevent social dislocations and hardships for the disadvantaged .  
Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Review the implementation and effectiveness of the programme of work of the secretariat , and make recommendations to the Commission about future programmes of work , and in this process ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked and Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development , socially and economically disadvantaged groups and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty and the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society , and the creation of more and better jobs , requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
These are : to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; to improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; to adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and to build ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
Targeting policies at the most vulnerable groups of society children , women , the elderly , the disadvantaged , the poor , the disabled is , moreover , a prerequisite for the successful realization of social justice , equity and respect for human dignity .  
Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on a people-centred approach that attempts to strengthen participation at the grass roots level by providing for decentralized , participatory , village-level democratic institutions with statutory representation for women and socially disadvantaged groups of people .  It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country .  
While the private sector is the " engine of development " , the Government has to lay and maintain the " tracks " that is , create and maintain the legal and regulatory environment for private ownership and fair competition , correct appropriately for market failures , protect the disadvantaged and maintain economic stability , law and order .  
Therefore , the medium-term plan focused on the continuing need to improve the living conditions of all people , especially the poor and disadvantaged population groups , in both rural and urban settlements , with special attention given to the development needs of the least developed countries and of countries with economies in transition .  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly the most disadvantaged children , including children with disabilities , refugee and internally displaced children , children ill _ treated and abused within the family and in institutions or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation and children who live and / or work on the street .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
The Committee was concerned that within the framework of economic and structural changes , including those arising from regional and international economic arrangements , insufficient attention had been paid to their impact on women in general and on disadvantaged women in particular .  
While it is not for the Government itself to build or finance the housing units required to satisfy all of the demand in the country , it should make every effort to ensure that a fair share of the resources available is utilized for making low _ cost housing available to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of society , and enabling the private sector to contribute to that endeavour .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .  
During their extended phase , all current projects would continue to address several common themes and issues critical to enhancing impact at the grass-roots level and improving the living conditions of poor and disadvantaged people .  
The basic idea was to integrate the most disadvantaged population groups into the national economy and to guarantee them equal opportunity for access to basic services , decent housing , productive employment and an adequate standard of living .  
The Government 's social security policy is to meet the basic and special needs of the disadvantaged , including the financially vulnerable , the elderly and the severely disabled .  
The right to an adequate standard of living is recognized in Australia , and supported by a system of social welfare which protects the most disadvantaged in society _ the unemployed , the sick , the elderly , indigenous peoples and people with disabilities .  
It also involves a form of socio _ economic and political restructuring which will remove the locus of power from the current custodians of State power , enable disadvantaged men and women to meet their basic needs and to fully participate in decision-making , and provide opportunities to challenge internal and external exploiters .  
Prompt and decisive action was needed to halt the decline in living standards in countries which had fallen prey to the global financial crisis , and Governments must enact policies to expand economic opportunities quickly for disadvantaged households and communities , and make them less vulnerable to future shocks .  
Attention continued to be focused on disadvantaged persons in peasant and indigenous settlements , as well as on the improvement , during this period , of services in the outlying neighbourhoods of Asuncin , which were reorganized and rescaled because they were out of step with the actual demographic situation and the demand for services .  
Human services , such as basic education and health care , technical and continuing education , information and extension services , care for the young , old and disabled and programmes to reduce marginalization of migrant , indigenous and other disadvantaged groups , are principally provided through public outlays in most countries .  
To secure progressively , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
Since the inception of this programme , a combined total of 581 social workers , teachers and caregivers has been trained with the aim of improving the quality of services to disadvantaged children , and of these 404 , or 70 per cent , have received training in the past six months .  
In the area of poverty alleviation , special emphasis was given to assisting Governments in enhancing the quality of life of the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including children , youth , older persons and disabled persons , through the provision of policy-oriented research and guidelines and the convening of intergovernmental meetings aimed at forging agreements on priority issues , policy approaches and regional benchmarks and their monitoring .  
The stabilization and adjustment measures implemented in many developing countries in different regions since the 1980s and more recently the financial crisis have drawn attention to the need to institute social safety net programmes in order to mitigate the short - and medium-term impact of the economic measures on the disadvantaged segment of the population .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party and further recommends that it increase measures to reduce economic and social disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party to reduce economic , social and regional disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
The combined effects of this and of ongoing armed conflicts and several devastating natural calamities had a disproportionate effect on the most disadvantaged groups of society , also contributing to increased feminization of poverty .  
Ensuring access to basic social services for the unreached , the vulnerable and the most disadvantaged members of society is not only morally imperative but also economically rational , eradicating the worst manifestation of poverty and laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and productivity gains in the future .  
The recent economic crisis in some countries in the region has worsened further the situation for many , especially the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including women , children , older persons , disabled persons , minority groups and migrant workers .  
We are confident that with disinterested assistance by the international community the Government of Indonesia will be able to bring the situation under control through tangible efforts including control of the armed elements , maintenance of security and extension of humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of the refugees and the disadvantaged civilians with the help of the International Red Cross .  
Measures which should be taken to ensure the right to health are understood to be effective administration of available resources to improve health , establishment of health policies with an emphasis on prevention , increased primary health care , special attention to the health needs of the most vulnerable and free health care for the most economically disadvantaged .  
In order to broaden their electoral base and thus their impact on the population , militant Hindu groups were deliberately attacking the Christian minority and its institutions in the education , health and social sectors because of their influence on the Indians , especially those who were the most disadvantaged or living in remote areas of the country .  
However , it needed a human face , a people-centred approach based on improving the standard of living for all : poverty must be eradicated , peoples basic needs must be fulfilled and human rights must be promoted , with special attention to the status of women , children and disadvantaged groups . 
India continued to believe that there was an urgent need for developing countries , with the assistance of the international community , to implement programmes which ensured a level of consumption for their citizens , especially the poor and disadvantaged , that met their basic needs .  
For instance , there may be concomitantly higher levels of street and ( low visibility ) intra-familial violence , large proportions of the population that are severely disadvantaged and young ( that is , in the age groups perpetrating and suffering crime ) , rapid migration into urban areas , lack of trust in law enforcement , inefficient justice systems , corruption , limited good governance and severe competition for scarce resources .  
Although the number of people in Malta living below the acceptable national standard of living is about 1 per cent of the population , the Government continues to give special importance to social services and , within the constraints of a small island economy , social welfare programmes now provide an adequate safety net even for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged .  
The CMAs Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics , which were developed in 1993 , are unique in that they represent the only available internationally recognized code of medical ethics to ( a ) deal with conditions of practice in developing countries ; ( b ) set out the ethical obligations of health professionals to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community ; and ( c ) be annotated throughout with references to corresponding internationally recognized human rights instruments .  
To secure , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
Throughout his adult life Roosevelt Douglas had a singular passionate commitment to the struggle for the liberation of black people everywhere and for the economic and political empowerment of the poor and disadvantaged .  
It may also be true that our continent is not yet free from this blight , which has drained some of our countries of resources , both material and human , which should have been used to improve the quality of life of the poor and the disadvantaged .  
The position of women is traditionally weak and subordinate in Nepalese society , rendering the CPN programmes , with their strong emphasis on equality , attractive , both among the growing cadre of educated women and those of the disadvantaged in rural areas .  
The Committee recommends that the State party allocate appropriate resources and develop comprehensive policies and programmes to improve health infrastructure , to increase the number of trained health and welfare , including mental health , professionals , to improve the health situation of children , to facilitate greater access to primary health services , to reduce the incidence of maternal , child and infant mortality , to prevent and combat malnutrition , especially in vulnerable and disadvantaged groups of children , and to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation .  
Under article 272 , there is a particular duty to coordinate activities of international programmes : States are to endeavour to ensure that international organizations competent in the field of transfer of marine technology coordinate their activities , including any regional or global programmes , taking into account the interests and needs of developing States , particularly landlocked and geographically disadvantaged States .  
It implies a commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the rights of groups that are disadvantaged or victims of discrimination and persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and cultural minorities to have free access to the expression of their own culture and that of others .  
UNFPA agreed to organize the eighth Round Table on Communication for Development , scheduled to take place from 26 to 29 November 2001 in Managua , Nicaragua , and proposed the following three central issues : evaluating the information programmes designed to halt the HIV / AIDS pandemic ; development of methodologies to evaluate current communication programmes ; and using community radio to reach the disadvantaged .  
To be more specific , the interaction between these diverse values and theories - - liberalists ' pursuit of democracy , personal freedom and enlightenment ; neo-conservatives ' affirmation of the need for political order and stability in the course of modernization and development ; and the New Left 's concern for the interests of the disadvantaged at the grassroots - - plays a positive practical role in safeguarding the sound and rational development of a society and in bringing about a more balanced society through checks and balances .  
At this year 's " two sessions , " the government has proposed that " full consideration should be given to the people 's capability of adapting themselves to the reform while carrying out reforms , and the expenses originally borne by the state and social institutions can not be shifted to the people . "  The government has also emphasized that the basic living standards of the disadvantaged people should be guaranteed , and a social security system should be established and improved .  NPC deputies and CPPCC members have recognized this .

Dr Yeoh noted that apart from a safety net for the needy , the vulnerable and the disadvantaged , there was a range of preventive , developmental and support services , as well as remedial services for those who required assistance .  These include services for the elderly , the family , the youth , and the disabled .  
The Government is fully committed to providing quality welfare services for those in need .  There is now in place a safety net for the needy , the vulnerable and the disadvantaged .  In addition , there is a range of preventive , developmental and support services , as well as remedial services for those who are vulnerable and require such assistance .  These include services for the elderly , the family , the youth , and the disabled .  
Following from the social philosophy and the four pillars I have just mentioned , the Government in the past five and a half years has put in a lot of resources and efforts to provide care and assistance for the physical and psychosocial well-being of the elderly , and to assist the disadvantaged , the poor and the unemployed with an emphasis on enhancing , not impeding , their will to self-reliance . 
The motion , to be moved by Hon Frederick FUNG , says " That , as the Government will introduce very shortly a new charging scheme for public health care services and , in parallel , enhance the existing medical fee waiver mechanism , this Council urges the Government to relax the eligibility criteria under the mechanism so as to benefit more people from the socially disadvantaged groups , such as elderly persons , low-income earners and chronic patients . "  
This is why many people take the view that just at the basic spirit behind the children 's welfare law is that children have self-esteem and need to be respected by adults , wild animals involved in the workings of human society also need people to fight for their most basic right " not to be subjected to mental terror or physical abuse , " in the same way that disadvantaged groups in society are protected .  
The disadvantaged of the disadvantagedAustralia 's public television has a regular program displaying government-sponsored documentaries which are filmed by their indigenous peoples . In the United States , many reservations have community programs produced and hosted by native Americans . But Taiwan 's public television news department is recruiting reporters whose aboriginal identity is a prerequisite . This is a rarity not only in Taiwan ; throughout the whole world it would be hard to find a comparable experience .  
Many elderly people who were unable to collect their subsidies ended up accusing the staff of being obstructionist . Moreover , beginning next year the central government will no longer compensate local governments for hiring social workers . It is likely that after many social workers leave their positions , the work of visiting and protecting the handicapped , women , children , and other disadvantaged groups will grind to an even slower pace .  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
With many of Taiwan 's wild animals having become " disadvantaged groups " or having even been driven to the verge of extinction by pressure from human development , it became a matter of necessity to pass the Wildlife Conservation Law to protect endemic and rare species . But at the same time , previously unknown species of tree frogs , shrews , bats , spiders and many other animals which , though unfamiliar , enrich the list of Taiwan 's endemic species , have recently been " discovered " in the wild .  
" Having aboriginal peoples making their own videos involves the problem of interpretation , " says documentary maker Li Tao-ming . In the past , outsiders often arrived with preconceived dichotomies like " mainstream vs . non-mainstream , or privileged vs . disadvantaged . They saw themselves as being in charge of the documentary effort , of being at a higher level than the subjects . This type of thinking must be smashed .  
Indeed , as far as he is concerned , " It seems like the film makers were all being ' politically correct , ' acting as if documentaries were only good for filming ' disadvantaged ' groups in society . These subjects and people inevitably become documentary material , and the film makers just use them because they make easy subject matter , " says Wang with sharp frankness .  
However , Chen Shui-bian 's iron fist in dealing with illegal video game arcades , the razing of illegal structures and actions against the sex industry and licensed prostitutes , as well as his constant disputes with the city council , led to growing opposition from interested parties and groups representing the disadvantaged . This in turn meant that many voters had reservations about the rough-and-tumble style of their first elected mayor .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media . When a female postal worker complained of discriminatory testing , and a young man suffered constant harassment by tax authorities after his ID card was used for someone else 's tax file , Chang took their cases to administrative authorities for the fair treatment they deserved . In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .  
Within three to six months of the end of the provisional session , the KMT plans to have completed a full review of party membership . Then there will be a direct election for the party chairman next June . In addition , in future special quotas will be set aside for youth , women , and disadvantaged groups to hold a total of 40% of the seats in party congresses , the Central Committee , and the CSC .  
In the sexual spectrum , there is a wide range of colors . To divide male and female into two extreme categories of masculine and feminine would make us unable to understand and appreciate disadvantaged groups . "  
Another and most troubling phenomenon for researchers is that as a self-supporting economic unit caring for the elderly and looking after children , the number of economically disadvantaged families has increased in recent years , and the gap between rich and poor households has widened .  
Society sighs and shakes it collective head at this subgroup , which consists of disadvantaged individuals , often unemployed and / or single parents , stuck on the lower rungs both socially and economically . When faced with injustice or adversity , they often do not know how to express their emotions or where to seek help . These lonely , helpless , marginalized individuals are most vulnerable to anger-whether as its wielders or its victims .  
Programmes for disadvantaged or vulnerable groups , in addition to reflecting a true understanding of the underlying problems of each group , must pass the test of being both equitable and efficient .  
Promoting the socioeconomic status of disadvantaged ethnic , cultural , occupational or religious groups is also difficult owing to a lack of effective and acceptable means of intervention .  
That approach seeks to ensure that the basic needs of the poor , disadvantaged and vulnerable are addressed , that communities are empowered and that natural resources are managed and used in an optimal manner .  
Much productive work of great social importance is not remunerated , such as caring for children and the elderly , protecting the environment and providing voluntary assistance to vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals and groups .  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
Ensure that disadvantaged and vulnerable persons and groups are included in social development , and that society acknowledges and responds to the consequences of disability by securing the legal rights of the individual and by making the physical and social environment accessible ;  
Promoting enterprise and productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule based international trading system and technologies for all people , particularly those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as the least developed countries ;  
Implementing measures to open market opportunities for all , especially people living in poverty and the disadvantaged , and to encourage individuals and communities to take economic initiatives , innovate and invest in activities that contribute to social development while promoting broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Access to credit by small rural or urban producers , landless farmers and other people with low or no income should be substantially improved , with special attention to the needs of women , and disadvantaged and vulnerable groups by :  
The legal system should be made more sensitive and responsive to the needs and special circumstances of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , to ensure the strong and independent administration of justice ;  
Such an inclusive society must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Supporting by legislation , incentives and other means , where appropriate , organizations of the vulnerable and disadvantaged groups so that they may promote the interests of the groups concerned and become involved in local and national , economic , social and political decision-making that guides society as a whole ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Ensure that structural adjustment programmes are so designed as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and communities , while ensuring their positive effects on such groups and communities by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities and devising measures to ensure that they gain access to and control over economic resources and economic and social activities ; actions should be taken to reduce inequality and economic disparity ;  
All parties involved in the development process , including academic institutions , non-governmental organizations and grass-roots and women 's groups , should mobilize to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes directed towards the poorest and most disadvantaged groups of women , such as rural and indigenous women , female heads of households , young women and older women , refugees and migrant women and women with disabilities .  
Enhance the access of disadvantaged women , including women entrepreneurs , in rural , remote and urban areas to financial services through strengthening links between the formal banks and intermediary lending organizations , including legislative support , training for women and institutional strengthening for intermediary institutions with a view to mobilizing capital for those institutions and increasing the availability of credit ;  
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed so as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to ensure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
In addition to selecting schools to be upgraded or built , the issue of equity between regions and genders should be assessed , with studies on selected policy matters , such as reducing imbalances for disadvantaged groups and increasing internal efficiency , in order to enable policy makers to make decisions based on in-depth analyses of local conditions and on comparative analysis of countries facing similar problems .  
Ensure universal and equal access to and completion of primary education by all children and eliminate the existing gap between girls and boys , as stipulated in article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ; 10 / similarly , ensure equal access to secondary education by the year 2005 and equal access to higher education , including vocational and technical education , for all girls and boys , including the disadvantaged and gifted ; 
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to assure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
Finally , how to intervene most effectively has to be judged - through economic policy instruments , legal reform , law enforcement , intergovernmental cooperation , political , administrative or judicial discretion , education policies , research and development policies , technology development and dissemination , or empowerment of particular geographical or disadvantaged social groups , such as indigenous people , minorities and women .  
In 1991 , the Bank issued a revised policy ( Operational Directive 4.20 ) , which extends the definition of indigenous peoples to include a much wider array of groups who maintain social and cultural identities distinct from those of the national societies in which they live , who have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and who are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
Promotes regional and subregional cooperation on modalities for addressing critical issues faced by disadvantaged groups in societies undergoing rapid change , with particular consideration to technical cooperation among developing countries through the organization of national and subregional training workshops and field study-cum-seminar programmes ;  
Access for all to the values , knowledge and skills imparted by the educational system is a prerequisite for ensuring the continuity and stability of democratic institutions , guaranteeing political , economic , social and cultural participation , especially on the part of the most disadvantaged groups and contributing to the fight against poverty .  
Some claim to have been denied housing because they are not associated with successful political parties or because they were orphans , refugees or other disadvantaged people who returned to the city or town too late , or were too powerless , to secure access to free housing in premises abandoned by their former owners .  
The Government also described the general legislative measures taken to eliminate racial discrimination in education , the special measures taken to ensure equality and to help the economically disadvantaged , and pointed out its commitment to the goal of providing access to general education for all children , funded by the State at an acceptable level of quality . 
most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports .

that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
With its financial resources and groups of experts , the United Nations system can assist the countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts for timely regional and global integration , in the context of an economic , trade , scientific and technological race on a global scale .  
The desire to ensure effective democratization in national life and to foster development is at the core of the activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to benefit children , young people , women , indigenous and rural populations , the disabled and certain particularly disadvantaged urban groups .  
We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
In addition , the problems of persistent poverty , increasing unemployment , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , environmental degradation , drug abuse and drug trafficking , crime , terrorism and social disintegration have combined to present a formidable array of challenges , which , if left unaddressed , threaten to overwhelm us and further marginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us . 
Stresses that Governments , in partnership with civil society and all other development actors , including non-governmental organizations and people living in poverty and their organizations should cooperate to meet the basic human needs of all - inter alia , income , resources , education , health care , nutrition , shelter , sanitation and safe water - in particular of people living in poverty and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups ;  
Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
[ Depending on local conditions in the housing sector and the availability of legal protection guaranteeing equal access to resources and opportunities , ] vulnerable groups include the poorest groups , some of the older persons , street children , youth , [ documented ] migrants , internally displaced persons , inhabitants of disadvantaged communities , people affected by natural and human-caused disasters , households headed by women , persons with disabilities and some indigenous people .  
( a bis ) Support , through legislation , incentives and other means , where appropriate , organizations of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups so that they may promote their interests and become involved in local and national economic , social and political decision-making ;  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
The legal system should be made more sensitive and responsive to the needs and special circumstances of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in order to ensure a strong and independent administration of justice ;  
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy . 
Cooperatively structured community enterprises are an effective organizational means whereby grass-roots initiative and both public and private funds can be combined in order to revitalize disadvantaged communities without creating dependency .  
We agree to support ongoing and new creative partnerships , recognizing that indigenous people , youth and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups possess in common the potential for diverse realization of full human development .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
In 1991 , the World Bank issued a revised policy which extends its own definition of indigenous people to include a much wider array of groups that maintain cultural and social identities distinct from those of the national societies where they live , have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
It was mentioned that the Centre was also committed to protecting and maintaining the historic , cultural and natural heritage of indigenous and other people , and that Governments , as enabling partners , should create and strengthen effective partnerships with vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities .  
The Committee , while recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the collection of data , is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to collect disaggregated data on the situation of all children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including black children , disabled children , street children , children placed in institutions , including institutions of a penal nature , ill-treated and abused children or children from economically disadvantaged groups , which constitutes a major obstacle to the effective and full implementation of the provisions of the Convention .  
The Committee also recommends that further measures be taken to gather systematic quantitative and qualitative data , disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , colour , rural / urban and social origin , on all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children , particularly the most disadvantaged groups .  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , and children who are forced to live and / or work in the streets in order to survive .  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
These are to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and the building of ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
However , the economic and cultural poverty of the most disadvantaged is a fertile breeding _ ground for the development of religious extremism and , more generally , for the political exploitation of religion ; this is evidenced by the conflicts in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the destruction of Babri Masjid and the intercommunal riots in Bombay .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , in institutions , or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , children belonging to minority groups , especially Roma , and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
There is little question that their social and economic potential is enormous , but so too are the risks that those without the capabilities to design , produce and use the new products and service applications may be disadvantaged or excluded from participating actively in their local communities and in the global information society .  
There is an urgent need to increase economic incentives for sustainable development based on full and comprehensive pricing that reflects all economic , social and environmental externalities , with targeted and explicit subsidies , where necessary , to prevent social dislocations and hardships for the disadvantaged .  
Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Review the implementation and effectiveness of the programme of work of the secretariat , and make recommendations to the Commission about future programmes of work , and in this process ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked and Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development , socially and economically disadvantaged groups and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty and the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society , and the creation of more and better jobs , requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
These are : to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; to improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; to adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and to build ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
Targeting policies at the most vulnerable groups of society children , women , the elderly , the disadvantaged , the poor , the disabled is , moreover , a prerequisite for the successful realization of social justice , equity and respect for human dignity .  
Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on a people-centred approach that attempts to strengthen participation at the grass roots level by providing for decentralized , participatory , village-level democratic institutions with statutory representation for women and socially disadvantaged groups of people .  It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country .  
While the private sector is the " engine of development " , the Government has to lay and maintain the " tracks " that is , create and maintain the legal and regulatory environment for private ownership and fair competition , correct appropriately for market failures , protect the disadvantaged and maintain economic stability , law and order .  
Therefore , the medium-term plan focused on the continuing need to improve the living conditions of all people , especially the poor and disadvantaged population groups , in both rural and urban settlements , with special attention given to the development needs of the least developed countries and of countries with economies in transition .  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly the most disadvantaged children , including children with disabilities , refugee and internally displaced children , children ill _ treated and abused within the family and in institutions or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation and children who live and / or work on the street .
