It is also worth mentioning that the private companies under Chen ostensibly included some joint ventures with Hong Kong businesses , some joint ventures with banks , and also some joint ventures with the Yuhu Prefectural Government . As such , public ownership were intermixed with private ownership to give people many false impressions and make it difficult for people to discern their nature off-hand .  This was to make it easy for them to profit from confusion and to slip away unpunished in the event of an exposure of their offenses .  
We must solidly and deeply launch the mass campaign of the exploration and construction of spiritual civilization and comprehensively conduct promotion and education , among all of the people , on scientific perspective on the world and methodology .  We must form a healthy atmosphere , in the entire society , which opposes superstition and ignorance and resists various false reasoning and heretical ideas .  We must continuously improve the masses ' ideological and moral levels and establish good spiritual habits .  
Along with the popularization and application of computer networks , the operation between different customs and between customs and relevant departments has been integrated into one .  So , customs and departments may exchange information through electronic records and may simultaneously read real information .  In this way , unlawful activities of cheating with false certificates will immediately be exposed .  
But with unfavorable terrain and weather conditions , it was impossible to effectively attack mobile tactical targets and concealed targets at such altitudes , let alone tell genuine and false targets apart .  
When the training entered the stage of camouflage concentration target confrontation , offices and soldiers of the " red army " set up concentration targets , such as real and false artillery positions , missile positions , and field airports using camouflage to make true targets invisible while leaving false targets exposed , such as shaped defilade , smoke screen , and false target .  
To make static targets moveable , the task force engaged in tackling major technical hurdles worked without a letup for several months , made do with whatever was available , and thus succeeded in developing movable false tanks , false armored cars , and other false targets .  
The one-man camouflage smoke launcher and assembled false target that they developed and improved won a third-class prize for military scientific and technological progress .  
During the Kosovo war , in view of NATO 's technical superiority in space and aerial reconnaisance , the Yugoslav People 's Army used the strategy of concealing the genuine and displaying the false and breaking up the whole into parts ; they hid their tanks in the woods and set up dummy targets all over the place and also arranged heat and electromagnetic sources around them , to lure and deceive the enemy reconnaisance system into being fooled . 
Those who hand in false documents or use other deceptive means to fraudulently obtain their registration , once discovered , must be promptly punished , to the point of having their business licenses suspended , by the industrial and commercial administrative organ .  
Being showy and not substantial , some people made false reports , exaggerated , practiced formalism , sought superficial grandeur , and paid no attention to real results .  Instead of accomplishing something , they only managed to deal with the higher levels ' inspections and assessments .  Although they accomplished nothing , their reports were closely reasoned and well argued .  
The surpassing road selected by the strategy of " three steps forward " means that , observing objective laws , one can pursue development in strides , skipping over stages .  It does not , however , set false objectives and diverge from reality , or mean that development in strides means arbitrarily skipping over certain necessary developmental stages , or inappropriately raising the objectives of the next stage of development .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
By holding a real-soldier training exercise on a real site and democratically pooling the wisdom of the masses , they developed a set of concrete tactics , such as " launching an attack by simultaneously pulling out the heart and eyes ; launching a joint attack by removing the skin tissue by tissue ; and laying an ambush by leaving a false way out , " thus enabling their light armored vehicles to fight with an iron fist and defend themselves like a fortress .  
Especially when we face the corrosion and influence of false ideas prevailing in society , constant adjustments in the relationships of public interests and the urgent task of preparing for military struggles , we should find an answer to and resolve the historical issues of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " and should have new and more demanding standards for implementation of the " program " and for the strengthening of grassroots construction .  
The unit has attached importance to the research of the characteristics of camouflage confrontation in modern warfare , and insisted on an integration of expedient material and advanced apparatus , of concealing the reality and showing the false , and of camouflage and protection maneuvers .  As a result , they have developed with innovation a batch of camouflage equipment applicable in actual combats .  
Therefore , it is essential that we further expose and criticize the false reasoning and heretical teachings of " Falungong " in order to further uncover the political nature of " Falungong " and the severe harm it causes , and to drive out evil and usher in the good so as to ensure total victory in this battle .  
This reveals the fact that Li Hongzhi 's false reasoning and heretical teaching is extremely hypocritical , confusing , and deceptive by nature .  This must not be treated lightly and it must be thoroughly exposed and criticized .  
Employment of such improper means for security trading may possibly lead to a sustained and artificial expansion of relevant security transaction volumes and a distortion of relevant securities ' purchasing-marketing relations and price changes .  Besides , this may sabotage the objective foundation with which other investors are able to make true judgments .  This may also create a false impression for stock markets and guide or enable investors to make decisions in security investment under the circumstances where they do not understand the true situation .  
He condemned " Falungong " saying that not only has " Falungong " built up itself by attacking religions and smearing the reputation and image of religions , but it has also controlled the spirit of followers and poisoned the souls of followers with false reasoning and heretical ideas .  This has resulted in suicides and murders among many followers , and destroyed families and disturbed the social order .  
Fu Dunchun , associate professor of Hainan University , said : a US military reconnaissance plane gathered intelligence in air space over the South China Sea , bumped and damaged our military aircraft , and illegally landed on our territory .  The US side has felt no regret at all , made false countercharges and claimed that " China should be held responsible for the incident . "  The United States has totally exposed its hegemonism .  
Personnel of a local people 's government or its subsidiary departments who retaliate by making a false charge against a unit or individual that reports regional blockade activities shall be punished by either demotion or dismissal , up to discharge from public employment , in accordance with legal procedure and based on the severity of the offense ;  
tax evasion , tax fraud , foreign exchange fraud , and smuggling activities have continued despite repeated attempts to prohibit them ; the phenomena of commercial fraud and debt evasion are becoming increasingly serious ; false financial statements and other behavior that violates financial and economic discipline are quite common ;  
However , since the DSP satellites are unable to effectively sound an early warning against an incoming tactical ballistic missile , are excessively dependent on a ground station , and are likely to sound a false alarm , and even an alarm in case of fire , the US Defense Department eventually decided in 1995 to phase out the DSP system and substitute it with an " air-based infrared early warning system " called SBIRS .  
It is understood that in light of the harmful social effects of false tabloid reports that deviate from correct opinion , exaggerate " hot spots of society , " and play up vulgarities , the SPPA issued the circular banning the press from publishing the following content :  
Japanese militarists described Taiwan and the northeast of our country as Japan 's lifeline and considered the entire Korean Peninsula as their permanent colony .  They included all of Asia in Japan 's sphere of influence .  Those false reasoning and fallacies have long been discarded in the garbage can of history .  
Fallacies such as " human rights above sovereignty " and " human rights have no national boundaries " are merely the false reasoning and excuses it uses for disregarding the international law and for grossly interfering in the internal affairs and unscrupulously encroaching on the sovereignty of other countries .  They are an open provocation against modern international law .  
In the " exclusive interview , " not only did Annette Lu manifest her die-hard " Taiwan independence " stance and plot of splittism , she also adopted a very contemptible means .  She used the Taiwan people as a " bargaining chip , " wantonly distorted facts and the Taiwan people 's desire , and created a false impression that Taiwan " is already a country of sovereign independence " in a vain attempt to create an excuse to " justify splittism . "  This fully displays the cunning side of her nature .  
Chairman Huang Guanghan , the first to give a speech , said that Annette Lu is wildly arrogant and presumptuous , ignorant and benighted , and that her statements about " Taiwan Independence " are simply false reasoning and heretical fallacies that arouse the public ire and receive widespread criticism .  
The historical contribution of the Taiwan Strait area and the Western Pacific coastal area in the 21st century , and whether it will create wealth or engender more conflict , will be decided based on whether the leaders of Taiwan , poised at a crossroads , can accurately judge the trends of the times , distinguishing true historical opportunities from false , in order to successfully negotiate the difficult situation in which they find themselves .  
In facing the complex situation before them , we hope that Taiwan 's leaders will deeply consider the true and the false , and set a beneficial policy , under the principle of one China , and with the two sides of the Strait as its center , with the people as its center , to promote a constructive trust and peaceful stability as the way forward , instead of a conflict creating a new potential conflict .

During these 10 years , he bore all types of false charges that had no basis , was subjected to unprecedented humiliation , experienced a lifetime 's most difficult " coming out of retirement , " and faced the most chaotic and irrational political situation .  
In the several years when Wen Ho Lee was investigated and prosecuted and in the days when the Cox Report was out , some quite reputable media in the United States tore off the " fair , objective , and factual " mask and , totally disregarding the most basic journalistic ethics , showered false accusations on China about the stealing of US nuclear secrets , and fanned up enmity against China among unknowledgeable American people .  
Traces of discrimination and prejudice were everywhere to be seen in the Wen Ho Lee case .  The US agencies concerned forced an arrest of Lee with a fabricated charge and , being prejudiced by first impressions , went to the extent of fabricating false evidence in an attempt to convict him of heavy offenses .  They put Lee in solitary confinement and in shackles and manacles , and for a time prohibited him from contacting outsiders and having exchanges with his family members in the Chinese language .  
Fabricating preposterous , bizarre , and astounding crooked theories and heretical doctrines and creating ideological disorder is the usual practice of all leaders of cults , who sail under false colors and hoodwink the masses .  
Both infringe upon the just rights and interests of the news units concerned .  What 's more , some websites carry news reports based on hearsay or even disseminate or quote false news and harmful information , thus misleading and confusing the public , creating confusion , and hurting the legal rights and interests of others as well as the public interests in society .  
The " Falungong " and other cults worship their founders in a big way and cook up false reasoning and heresies to profane human dignity , to jeopardize social stability , and to hoodwink the good and honest masses in an attempt to achieve their evil , ulterior , anti-human , anti-social , and anti-science purposes .  
They neither reach deep into the reality nor go deep among the masses .  Refraining from making investigations and studies and without a clear understanding of the real situation , they act on their own personal feeling and subjective will .  What they are seeking is their own promotion .  They deceive their superiors and delude their subordinates and make false work performance .  And they do not hesitate to waste manpower and public funds .  As for the people 's well-being and demands , they are indifferent and insensitive .  
As briefed by public security organs , the content of the confiscated illegal publicity materials included materials to publicize false reasoning and heresies of " Falungong " heretical cult , to instigate people to violate laws and create disturbances , and to viciously spread rumors to slander against the government and state leaders .  
Wang Ming , vice president of the Beijing Higher People 's Court and senior judge who has been engaging in criminal judicial work for a long time , pointed out : After the state banned " Falungong " heretic cult organizations in line with the law , Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " heretical cult organizations have continued to openly publicize false reasoning and fallacies to defile the government and slander against other people .  These acts have violated China 's Constitution and relevant provisions of the law and are evidently harmful to society .  
Some leading cadres , in pursuit of achievements in their official careers , engage in numerical tricks , submit false statistics to the higher authorities , and force the lower levels for high statistical figures , giving rise to local boastfulness , wasting hosts of human , material , and financial resources , and ruining the people 's interests .  
People of religious circles expressed one after another their positive response and pledged to firmly support activities of " fighting against heretical cults by religious circles , " eradicating evil things , discarding the false and retaining the true , and making contributions to cutting out the tumor of the " Falungong cult and creating an auspicious , peaceful and happy society .  
Over the years police at Chung Ying Street have seized such controlled items and contraband as drugs , live chickens , pirated CDs and , as of May for this year alone , a quantity of false trade mark clothes and imported garments without licence valued at over $ 4.5 million .

" The principal element of the offence is that the person knowingly provides information to the SFC or the market operator in question that is false , misleading or incomplete in a material particular , or that he does not believe that the information provided is true , complete and accurate in every material particular .  
The mental element forms a crucial basis for any prosecution action , " the spokesman explained .

In the period , officers of the Textile Task Force ( TTF ) intercepted and checked 555 textile consignments at boundary control points .  The result was that three consignments were detained for disposal check and 15 consignments were seized for investigation .  Textile traders were suspected to have imported or exported unmanifested cargoes and garments bearing false origin labels and forged trade marks , or misrepresented in import or export documents .  The goods mainly comprise T-shirts , blouses , pants and jackets valued at about $ 6.01 million .  
In two of the cases detected by the TTF , traders declared in the import documents that the imported goods were for local consumption , whereas in fact the goods had been entirely manufactured in Mainland China , intended for export to quota restrained countries under false claim to Hong Kong origin .  
Regarding the proposals of the Education Commission to allocate 85 per cent of Primary One places on the principle of " vicinity " and to encourage primary and secondary schools to link among themselves to facilitate direct admission of Primary Six students to the linked secondary schools , there are comments that such proposals will result in more parents giving false residential addresses or moving to districts which fall within the school nets of their preferred schools so as to enhance the chance of their children being admitted to those schools .  
If there is any doubt , the ED will interview the parents concerned or ask them to provide other documentary proof .  If parents are found to have given false addresses , the applicants will be disqualified from applying for a discretionary place and will only be allocated a school place in their own school nets based on their genuine residential addresses at the " Central Allocation " stage .

Initial enquiries revealed that after the close down and self winding-up of a limited company running a restaurant in Kam Tin , the ex-manager , a 25-year-old man , was believed to have conspired with ex-employees and some other persons to make fraudulent claims to the Labour Department by providing false information pertinent to an overstated amount of salaries earned by the employees .  
At about 11.45pm , the officers intercepted an outgoing lorry declared to be empty .  After conducting a thorough examination , the officers found 237 central processing units and 648 hard disks , worth a total of $ 620,000 , inside a false compartment on the underside of the vehicle .  
However the sums involved are nevertheless very large , and the frauds leading to these losses have ranged from simple instances of false accounting by individual employees , to large scale intricate deceptions at the corporate level .  
One of the first national measures promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs was in May 1981 . This legislation sought to contain the violation of trademarks and the false marks of " made in . . . " trend in domestic manufacturing of counterfeit goods .

Classical neo - - Mannerist architecture favors round pillars and gables , and the external walls are mostly decorated with white false stone ; it is relatively stately . Non-classical neo-Mannerist architecture includes Byzantine-style or the North European traditional brick construction ; the outside is relatively complex , luxurious , and free-wheeling .  
Professor Yang Ling-ling of the Taipei Medical College points out that Chinese are in the habit of taking composite medications rather carelessly In particular there are many so-called " informal recipes " for Chinese traditional remedies that include diuretic ingredients which are potentially toxic . Diuretics can create a false impression of increased urine flow , which can make uremia sufferers careless , when in fact they may be extending the illness and even worsening the damage to the kidneys . "  
In a photograph , a concrete model animal , of a kind which can be seen anywhere in Taiwan , is pictured in the most natural , realistic style ; it looks so false - - and yet so real .  
But after some discussion it was concluded that the reason Mother Yu had this " false impression " was perhaps because the model was so small and was not colored , combined with the visual effect of looking down on it from above When Huang Sheng-yuan remade the model at one-fiftieth scale , and , in accordance with Mother Yu 's wishes , pasted up spring couplets in the right places and painted the walls red where they were to be built of bricks , Mother Yu was finally more able to accept the house 's appearance .  
Take for example illegal entry into the exclusive maritime economic zone to catch fish . Last May , the Taiwanese ship Tung Heng # 3 , which is supposed to operate only in the high seas , was painted red to give it the false appearance of a joint venture ship , and entered into the economic zone .  
For example , in 1992 , before gay activism in Taiwan had really taken off , the group 's publication Girlfriend led the way in protesting the incident in which a Taiwan Television ( TTV ) news program surreptitiously filmed inside a lesbian bar , and another incident in which TTV interviewed the androgynous singer Pan Mei-cheng under false premises . The public came out solidly behind Girlfriend . Ultimately , the National Press Council of the ROC judged that TTV had handled the story improperly .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
As tectonic forces pushed Taiwan continuously upwards and the rivers carved their way downward , such areas of collapse occurred in many places . Doughty false cypress seeds seized the opportunity to colonize this hostile territory shunned by other plants . There they gradually grew into gigantic trees , rehabilitating the land and attracting other species . At the same time they protected downstream areas , making them suitable for settlement and farming .  
Large-scale logging of false cypresses continued right up to 1989 . With forestry earning no profits , and in response to energetic lobbying by civic groups , the Executive Yuan finally banned the cutting of natural forests , at last giving a respite to the giant trees which protect Taiwan 's land .  
But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached . Apart from some scattered local stands , the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt . Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000-plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt . Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees .  
" The false cypress forests that survive in this mountainous island with its wet maritime climate are rare relics of an ancient forest type that today only remains in parts of East Asia and North America . It well deserves to be called a world-class natural heritage site , not just a national one . " This is how the Ilan County Cultural Affairs Bureau 's brochure confidently describes the Chilan cypress forest .  
A third of Taiwan 's native fern species grow in the damp , shady forest , and endemic Taiwanese plants such as the Taiwan pleione orchid live here too . The ancient false cypresses are a paradise for epiphytic plants , with up to 80 species living on a single tree .  
" The growth of the false cypress forests represents a process of stabilization of the rolling mountain rivers . The false cypress trees are the living deities of the process of natural restoration of the land , " writes Chen Yu-feng in his book The Flora of Taiwan . In particular , the medium-elevation cloud forests are unstable zones of heavy rainfall and powerful erosion , and when mighty false cypress trees spring up along the lines of collapse they mend the gashes in the forest and bring new life to the broken ground .  
The false cypress forests which bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing Taiwan 's fragmented earth , also form a safety valve for the Shihmen Reservoir , Tanshui River and Lanyang River on which the people of northern Taiwan depend for their drinking water . The band of cypress forest that runs from Mt . Chilan to Mt . Lala forms a huge natural reservoir that soaks up heavy rainfall and releases it in gentler flows while keeping the soil firmly in its grasp , in a way that no human engineering project could replicate .  
It is false that the market , with its magical invisible hand , is the definitive solution for the immense disruptions affecting the international economy and that it is the miraculous remedy that would liberate many countries , home to the vast majority of the earth 's population , from underdevelopment and poverty .  
Xenophobia , intolerance and false doctrines of racial superiority gave rise to acts of discrimination and violence against vulnerable groups , migrant workers and foreigners ; it was therefore essential to give the highest support to the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination , a framework which would make it possible to address the political manipulation of intolerance through new efforts at the national and international levels .  
Bearing in mind that Western media allegations of Libyan terrorism had proved false , his delegation joined with those which had stressed the need to draw up a code of conduct concerning the media and information with a view to reinforcing the ground rules for fairness and impartiality and respect for the choices of peoples relating to lifestyle and to political , economic , social and cultural development .  
Recalling also and concurring with the conclusions of and recommendations made by recent international conferences on the human rights of women and girl children , in particular with respect to the violation of those rights through sexual and economic exploitation for the profit of recruiters , traffickers and crime syndicates , as well as other illegal activities related to trafficking , such as forced domestic labour , false marriages , child marriages , clandestine employment and false adoption ,  
It is hypocritical that the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations should level false accusations against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the subject of protection of cultural heritage , when it is a well-known fact that Greece itself is engaged in a policy of forcible assimilation of the Turkish minority in western Thrace , coupled with systematic pillaging and obliteration of Turkish monuments .  
However , in todays conditions , where instantaneous reporting has such a profound influence on public opinion , and sustained and focused false reports can distort reality beyond recognition , there is need for a prompt response to set the record straight .  
Those engaged in such activities make free use of fake end-user certificates , exploit loopholes in the law , evade customs and other airport controls by making clandestine night take-offs and landings , file false flight plans and conceal their movements by using fabricated zone permits , evading radar tracking and observing radio silence in flight .  
He agreed with the view , expressed in paragraph 21 of the Advisory Committees first report ( A / 52 / 7 ) , that an economy that resulted in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service was a false economy and that the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget were realistic and reliable .  
An economy that results in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service is a false economy and the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget are realistic and reliable .

Violence committed within a family is not exempt from the penal provisions applied in cases of , inter alia , battery , bodily injury , false arrest and imprisonment , indecent assault and rape , and these penal provisions are enforced appropriately .  
That assumption was proved false in the Russian case , and consequently there were considerable fears in SeptemberOctober of a global recession being triggered by the falls in stock prices and the threat of a credit crunch as credit conditions were tightened significantly , not only for borrowers in emerging markets but also in developed market economies , such as the United States , where the spreads over United States Treasury Bills for corporate borrowing rose significantly .  
I remain convinced that , to break this futile annual cycle of false expectations and depressing recurrence of violence , the Afghan factions , and also those countries supporting them , must finally recognize that the conflict can not be resolved through warfare and that a negotiated settlement represents the only viable path to lasting peace .  
Take note of and adopt sanctions against Rwanda and Uganda for the systematic pillaging of the raw materials of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which is the real motive behind this invasion , contrary to the false pretext of security considerations which the two aggressor countries are flaunting in their vain , deliberate attempt to deceive the international community as to the real reasons for their criminal enterprise in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ;  
Ms . Viotti ( Brazil ) said that ethnic cleansing , the resurgence of false doctrines of racial superiority , the trend towards restricting the rights of migrant workers , the use of new technologies to spread intolerance and the abuses committed against asylum-seekers and refugees were just some of the obstacles which the international community must overcome to keep alive the spirit that had inspired the historic struggle to put an end to racism .  
Hiring private companies providing security and military assistance and advice is no substitute for maintaining a collective regional security system and genuinely professional national armed forces and security forces loyal to the democratic legal order.It is a false solution . 
Nonetheless , the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the potential for abusive withholding of transfer requests is present , irrespective of actual practice , and finds it desirable that such apparent gaps in protection be closed wherever possible , not least to guard against false allegations .  
Too often , nationalism has been used to advance a racist , discriminatory , and persecutory policy that scapegoats ethnic , religious , and political groups as a false pretext for the existence of national problems .  
It demonstrates that the false pretext of border insecurity is no longer tenable and that the real motive for the aggression is the systematic plundering and illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
We note with regret that certain media circles , by promoting false images , particularly of migrant workers and refugees , have contributed to the spread of xenophobic sentiments among the public and have encouraged violence by racist groups ; 96 .  We recognize the positive contribution the exercise of the right to freedom of expression ,  
It is also worth mentioning that the private companies under Chen ostensibly included some joint ventures with Hong Kong businesses , some joint ventures with banks , and also some joint ventures with the Yuhu Prefectural Government . As such , public ownership were intermixed with private ownership to give people many false impressions and make it difficult for people to discern their nature off-hand .  This was to make it easy for them to profit from confusion and to slip away unpunished in the event of an exposure of their offenses .  
We must solidly and deeply launch the mass campaign of the exploration and construction of spiritual civilization and comprehensively conduct promotion and education , among all of the people , on scientific perspective on the world and methodology .  We must form a healthy atmosphere , in the entire society , which opposes superstition and ignorance and resists various false reasoning and heretical ideas .  We must continuously improve the masses ' ideological and moral levels and establish good spiritual habits .  
Along with the popularization and application of computer networks , the operation between different customs and between customs and relevant departments has been integrated into one .  So , customs and departments may exchange information through electronic records and may simultaneously read real information .  In this way , unlawful activities of cheating with false certificates will immediately be exposed .  
But with unfavorable terrain and weather conditions , it was impossible to effectively attack mobile tactical targets and concealed targets at such altitudes , let alone tell genuine and false targets apart .  
When the training entered the stage of camouflage concentration target confrontation , offices and soldiers of the " red army " set up concentration targets , such as real and false artillery positions , missile positions , and field airports using camouflage to make true targets invisible while leaving false targets exposed , such as shaped defilade , smoke screen , and false target .  
To make static targets moveable , the task force engaged in tackling major technical hurdles worked without a letup for several months , made do with whatever was available , and thus succeeded in developing movable false tanks , false armored cars , and other false targets .  
The one-man camouflage smoke launcher and assembled false target that they developed and improved won a third-class prize for military scientific and technological progress .  
During the Kosovo war , in view of NATO 's technical superiority in space and aerial reconnaisance , the Yugoslav People 's Army used the strategy of concealing the genuine and displaying the false and breaking up the whole into parts ; they hid their tanks in the woods and set up dummy targets all over the place and also arranged heat and electromagnetic sources around them , to lure and deceive the enemy reconnaisance system into being fooled . 
Those who hand in false documents or use other deceptive means to fraudulently obtain their registration , once discovered , must be promptly punished , to the point of having their business licenses suspended , by the industrial and commercial administrative organ .  
Being showy and not substantial , some people made false reports , exaggerated , practiced formalism , sought superficial grandeur , and paid no attention to real results .  Instead of accomplishing something , they only managed to deal with the higher levels ' inspections and assessments .  Although they accomplished nothing , their reports were closely reasoned and well argued .  
The surpassing road selected by the strategy of " three steps forward " means that , observing objective laws , one can pursue development in strides , skipping over stages .  It does not , however , set false objectives and diverge from reality , or mean that development in strides means arbitrarily skipping over certain necessary developmental stages , or inappropriately raising the objectives of the next stage of development .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
By holding a real-soldier training exercise on a real site and democratically pooling the wisdom of the masses , they developed a set of concrete tactics , such as " launching an attack by simultaneously pulling out the heart and eyes ; launching a joint attack by removing the skin tissue by tissue ; and laying an ambush by leaving a false way out , " thus enabling their light armored vehicles to fight with an iron fist and defend themselves like a fortress .  
Especially when we face the corrosion and influence of false ideas prevailing in society , constant adjustments in the relationships of public interests and the urgent task of preparing for military struggles , we should find an answer to and resolve the historical issues of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " and should have new and more demanding standards for implementation of the " program " and for the strengthening of grassroots construction .  
The unit has attached importance to the research of the characteristics of camouflage confrontation in modern warfare , and insisted on an integration of expedient material and advanced apparatus , of concealing the reality and showing the false , and of camouflage and protection maneuvers .  As a result , they have developed with innovation a batch of camouflage equipment applicable in actual combats .  
Therefore , it is essential that we further expose and criticize the false reasoning and heretical teachings of " Falungong " in order to further uncover the political nature of " Falungong " and the severe harm it causes , and to drive out evil and usher in the good so as to ensure total victory in this battle .  
This reveals the fact that Li Hongzhi 's false reasoning and heretical teaching is extremely hypocritical , confusing , and deceptive by nature .  This must not be treated lightly and it must be thoroughly exposed and criticized .  
Employment of such improper means for security trading may possibly lead to a sustained and artificial expansion of relevant security transaction volumes and a distortion of relevant securities ' purchasing-marketing relations and price changes .  Besides , this may sabotage the objective foundation with which other investors are able to make true judgments .

He condemned " Falungong " saying that not only has " Falungong " built up itself by attacking religions and smearing the reputation and image of religions , but it has also controlled the spirit of followers and poisoned the souls of followers with false reasoning and heretical ideas .  This has resulted in suicides and murders among many followers , and destroyed families and disturbed the social order .  
Fu Dunchun , associate professor of Hainan University , said : a US military reconnaissance plane gathered intelligence in air space over the South China Sea , bumped and damaged our military aircraft , and illegally landed on our territory .

Personnel of a local people 's government or its subsidiary departments who retaliate by making a false charge against a unit or individual that reports regional blockade activities shall be punished by either demotion or dismissal , up to discharge from public employment , in accordance with legal procedure and based on the severity of the offense ;  
tax evasion , tax fraud , foreign exchange fraud , and smuggling activities have continued despite repeated attempts to prohibit them ; the phenomena of commercial fraud and debt evasion are becoming increasingly serious ; false financial statements and other behavior that violates financial and economic discipline are quite common ;  
However , since the DSP satellites are unable to effectively sound an early warning against an incoming tactical ballistic missile , are excessively dependent on a ground station , and are likely to sound a false alarm , and even an alarm in case of fire , the US Defense Department eventually decided in 1995 to phase out the DSP system and substitute it with an " air-based infrared early warning system " called SBIRS .

Japanese militarists described Taiwan and the northeast of our country as Japan 's lifeline and considered the entire Korean Peninsula as their permanent colony .  They included all of Asia in Japan 's sphere of influence .  Those false reasoning and fallacies have long been discarded in the garbage can of history .  
Fallacies such as " human rights above sovereignty " and " human rights have no national boundaries " are merely the false reasoning and excuses it uses for disregarding the international law and for grossly interfering in the internal affairs and unscrupulously encroaching on the sovereignty of other countries .  They are an open provocation against modern international law .  
In the " exclusive interview , " not only did Annette Lu manifest her die-hard " Taiwan independence " stance and plot of splittism , she also adopted a very contemptible means .  She used the Taiwan people as a " bargaining chip , " wantonly distorted facts and the Taiwan people 's desire , and created a false impression that Taiwan " is already a country of sovereign independence " in a vain attempt to create an excuse to " justify splittism . "  This fully displays the cunning side of her nature .  
Chairman Huang Guanghan , the first to give a speech , said that Annette Lu is wildly arrogant and presumptuous , ignorant and benighted , and that her statements about " Taiwan Independence " are simply false reasoning and heretical fallacies that arouse the public ire and receive widespread criticism .  
The historical contribution of the Taiwan Strait area and the Western Pacific coastal area in the 21st century , and whether it will create wealth or engender more conflict , will be decided based on whether the leaders of Taiwan , poised at a crossroads , can accurately judge the trends of the times , distinguishing true historical opportunities from false , in order to successfully negotiate the difficult situation in which they find themselves .  
In facing the complex situation before them , we hope that Taiwan 's leaders will deeply consider the true and the false , and set a beneficial policy , under the principle of one China , and with the two sides of the Strait as its center , with the people as its center , to promote a constructive trust and peaceful stability as the way forward , instead of a conflict creating a new potential conflict .

During these 10 years , he bore all types of false charges that had no basis , was subjected to unprecedented humiliation , experienced a lifetime 's most difficult " coming out of retirement , " and faced the most chaotic and irrational political situation .  
In the several years when Wen Ho Lee was investigated and prosecuted and in the days when the Cox Report was out , some quite reputable media in the United States tore off the " fair , objective , and factual " mask and , totally disregarding the most basic journalistic ethics , showered false accusations on China about the stealing of US nuclear secrets , and fanned up enmity against China among unknowledgeable American people .  
Traces of discrimination and prejudice were everywhere to be seen in the Wen Ho Lee case .  The US agencies concerned forced an arrest of Lee with a fabricated charge and , being prejudiced by first impressions , went to the extent of fabricating false evidence in an attempt to convict him of heavy offenses .  They put Lee in solitary confinement and in shackles and manacles , and for a time prohibited him from contacting outsiders and having exchanges with his family members in the Chinese language .  
Fabricating preposterous , bizarre , and astounding crooked theories and heretical doctrines and creating ideological disorder is the usual practice of all leaders of cults , who sail under false colors and hoodwink the masses .  
Both infringe upon the just rights and interests of the news units concerned .  What 's more , some websites carry news reports based on hearsay or even disseminate or quote false news and harmful information , thus misleading and confusing the public , creating confusion , and hurting the legal rights and interests of others as well as the public interests in society .  
The " Falungong " and other cults worship their founders in a big way and cook up false reasoning and heresies to profane human dignity , to jeopardize social stability , and to hoodwink the good and honest masses in an attempt to achieve their evil , ulterior , anti-human , anti-social , and anti-science purposes .  
They neither reach deep into the reality nor go deep among the masses .  Refraining from making investigations and studies and without a clear understanding of the real situation , they act on their own personal feeling and subjective will .  What they are seeking is their own promotion .  They deceive their superiors and delude their subordinates and make false work performance .  And they do not hesitate to waste manpower and public funds .  As for the people 's well-being and demands , they are indifferent and insensitive .  
As briefed by public security organs , the content of the confiscated illegal publicity materials included materials to publicize false reasoning and heresies of " Falungong " heretical cult , to instigate people to violate laws and create disturbances , and to viciously spread rumors to slander against the government and state leaders .  
Wang Ming , vice president of the Beijing Higher People 's Court and senior judge who has been engaging in criminal judicial work for a long time , pointed out : After the state banned " Falungong " heretic cult organizations in line with the law , Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " heretical cult organizations have continued to openly publicize false reasoning and fallacies to defile the government and slander against other people .  These acts have violated China 's Constitution and relevant provisions of the law and are evidently harmful to society .  
Some leading cadres , in pursuit of achievements in their official careers , engage in numerical tricks , submit false statistics to the higher authorities , and force the lower levels for high statistical figures , giving rise to local boastfulness , wasting hosts of human , material , and financial resources , and ruining the people 's interests .  
People of religious circles expressed one after another their positive response and pledged to firmly support activities of " fighting against heretical cults by religious circles , " eradicating evil things , discarding the false and retaining the true , and making contributions to cutting out the tumor of the " Falungong cult and creating an auspicious , peaceful and happy society .

Textile traders were suspected to have imported or exported unmanifested cargoes and garments bearing false origin labels and forged trade marks , or misrepresented in import or export documents .  The goods mainly comprise T-shirts , blouses , pants and jackets valued at about $ 6.01 million .

Regarding the proposals of the Education Commission to allocate 85 per cent of Primary One places on the principle of " vicinity " and to encourage primary and secondary schools to link among themselves to facilitate direct admission of Primary Six students to the linked secondary schools , there are comments that such proposals will result in more parents giving false residential addresses or moving to districts which fall within the school nets of their preferred schools so as to enhance the chance of their children being admitted to those schools .  
If there is any doubt , the ED will interview the parents concerned or ask them to provide other documentary proof .  If parents are found to have given false addresses , the applicants will be disqualified from applying for a discretionary place and will only be allocated a school place in their own school nets based on their genuine residential addresses at the " Central Allocation " stage .

Professor Yang Ling-ling of the Taipei Medical College points out that Chinese are in the habit of taking composite medications rather carelessly In particular there are many so-called " informal recipes " for Chinese traditional remedies that include diuretic ingredients which are potentially toxic . Diuretics can create a false impression of increased urine flow , which can make uremia sufferers careless , when in fact they may be extending the illness and even worsening the damage to the kidneys . "  
In a photograph , a concrete model animal , of a kind which can be seen anywhere in Taiwan , is pictured in the most natural , realistic style ; it looks so false - - and yet so real .  
But after some discussion it was concluded that the reason Mother Yu had this " false impression " was perhaps because the model was so small and was not colored , combined with the visual effect of looking down on it from above When Huang Sheng-yuan remade the model at one-fiftieth scale , and , in accordance with Mother Yu 's wishes , pasted up spring couplets in the right places and painted the walls red where they were to be built of bricks , Mother Yu was finally more able to accept the house 's appearance .  
Take for example illegal entry into the exclusive maritime economic zone to catch fish . Last May , the Taiwanese ship Tung Heng # 3 , which is supposed to operate only in the high seas , was painted red to give it the false appearance of a joint venture ship , and entered into the economic zone .  
For example , in 1992 , before gay activism in Taiwan had really taken off , the group 's publication Girlfriend led the way in protesting the incident in which a Taiwan Television ( TTV ) news program surreptitiously filmed inside a lesbian bar , and another incident in which TTV interviewed the androgynous singer Pan Mei-cheng under false premises . The public came out solidly behind Girlfriend . Ultimately , the National Press Council of the ROC judged that TTV had handled the story improperly .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
As tectonic forces pushed Taiwan continuously upwards and the rivers carved their way downward , such areas of collapse occurred in many places . Doughty false cypress seeds seized the opportunity to colonize this hostile territory shunned by other plants . There they gradually grew into gigantic trees , rehabilitating the land and attracting other species . At the same time they protected downstream areas , making them suitable for settlement and farming .  
Large-scale logging of false cypresses continued right up to 1989 . With forestry earning no profits , and in response to energetic lobbying by civic groups , the Executive Yuan finally banned the cutting of natural forests , at last giving a respite to the giant trees which protect Taiwan 's land .  
But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached . Apart from some scattered local stands , the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt . Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000-plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt . Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees .  
" The false cypress forests that survive in this mountainous island with its wet maritime climate are rare relics of an ancient forest type that today only remains in parts of East Asia and North America . It well deserves to be called a world-class natural heritage site , not just a national one . " This is how the Ilan County Cultural Affairs Bureau 's brochure confidently describes the Chilan cypress forest .  
A third of Taiwan 's native fern species grow in the damp , shady forest , and endemic Taiwanese plants such as the Taiwan pleione orchid live here too . The ancient false cypresses are a paradise for epiphytic plants , with up to 80 species living on a single tree .  
" The growth of the false cypress forests represents a process of stabilization of the rolling mountain rivers . The false cypress trees are the living deities of the process of natural restoration of the land , " writes Chen Yu-feng in his book The Flora of Taiwan . In particular , the medium-elevation cloud forests are unstable zones of heavy rainfall and powerful erosion , and when mighty false cypress trees spring up along the lines of collapse they mend the gashes in the forest and bring new life to the broken ground .  
The false cypress forests which bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing Taiwan 's fragmented earth , also form a safety valve for the Shihmen Reservoir , Tanshui River and Lanyang River on which the people of northern Taiwan depend for their drinking water . The band of cypress forest that runs from Mt . Chilan to Mt . Lala forms a huge natural reservoir that soaks up heavy rainfall and releases it in gentler flows while keeping the soil firmly in its grasp , in a way that no human engineering project could replicate .  
It is false that the market , with its magical invisible hand , is the definitive solution for the immense disruptions affecting the international economy and that it is the miraculous remedy that would liberate many countries , home to the vast majority of the earth 's population , from underdevelopment and poverty .  
Xenophobia , intolerance and false doctrines of racial superiority gave rise to acts of discrimination and violence against vulnerable groups , migrant workers and foreigners ; it was therefore essential to give the highest support to the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination , a framework which would make it possible to address the political manipulation of intolerance through new efforts at the national and international levels .

It is hypocritical that the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations should level false accusations against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the subject of protection of cultural heritage , when it is a well-known fact that Greece itself is engaged in a policy of forcible assimilation of the Turkish minority in western Thrace , coupled with systematic pillaging and obliteration of Turkish monuments .  
However , in todays conditions , where instantaneous reporting has such a profound influence on public opinion , and sustained and focused false reports can distort reality beyond recognition , there is need for a prompt response to set the record straight .

Violence committed within a family is not exempt from the penal provisions applied in cases of , inter alia , battery , bodily injury , false arrest and imprisonment , indecent assault and rape , and these penal provisions are enforced appropriately .  
That assumption was proved false in the Russian case , and consequently there were considerable fears in SeptemberOctober of a global recession being triggered by the falls in stock prices and the threat of a credit crunch as credit conditions were tightened significantly , not only for borrowers in emerging markets but also in developed market economies , such as the United States , where the spreads over United States Treasury Bills for corporate borrowing rose significantly .  
I remain convinced that , to break this futile annual cycle of false expectations and depressing recurrence of violence , the Afghan factions , and also those countries supporting them , must finally recognize that the conflict can not be resolved through warfare and that a negotiated settlement represents the only viable path to lasting peace .  
Take note of and adopt sanctions against Rwanda and Uganda for the systematic pillaging of the raw materials of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which is the real motive behind this invasion , contrary to the false pretext of security considerations which the two aggressor countries are flaunting in their vain , deliberate attempt to deceive the international community as to the real reasons for their criminal enterprise in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ;  
Ms . Viotti ( Brazil ) said that ethnic cleansing , the resurgence of false doctrines of racial superiority , the trend towards restricting the rights of migrant workers , the use of new technologies to spread intolerance and the abuses committed against asylum-seekers and refugees were just some of the obstacles which the international community must overcome to keep alive the spirit that had inspired the historic struggle to put an end to racism .  
Hiring private companies providing security and military assistance and advice is no substitute for maintaining a collective regional security system and genuinely professional national armed forces and security forces loyal to the democratic legal order.It is a false solution . 
Nonetheless , the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the potential for abusive withholding of transfer requests is present , irrespective of actual practice , and finds it desirable that such apparent gaps in protection be closed wherever possible , not least to guard against false allegations .  
Too often , nationalism has been used to advance a racist , discriminatory , and persecutory policy that scapegoats ethnic , religious , and political groups as a false pretext for the existence of national problems .  
It demonstrates that the false pretext of border insecurity is no longer tenable and that the real motive for the aggression is the systematic plundering and illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
We note with regret that certain media circles , by promoting false images , particularly of migrant workers and refugees , have contributed to the spread of xenophobic sentiments among the public and have encouraged violence by racist groups ; 96 .  We recognize the positive contribution the exercise of the right to freedom of expression ,
