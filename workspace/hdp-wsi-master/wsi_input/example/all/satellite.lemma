The aforementioned figures of continuous deforestation evidenced by satellite photos show that damages to the Amazon caused by cattle farming have been greater than those caused by lumbering and the ongoing expansion of soybean cultivation , both of which have been the focus of extensive media coverage .  
At the drilling ground this correspondent saw professional support team members carry out emergency repair work on telecommunication optical fiber cables that had been destroyed by the " enemy , " and use modern telecommunication equipment , such as maritime-type portable satellite telephones and VSAT small-sized satellite ground stations , under electronic jamming condition , to serve the purpose of war-time mobile telecommunication support .  
Wei Ziqing ( researcher and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering ) : The use of satellite navigation is extremely widespread , from outer space to the land and sea , and from military and economic activities to our human and social lives , it reaches every trade and industry , e.g . , space navigation , determining satellite orbits , space surveys and mapping , weapons guidance , traffic and transportation , agriculture , forestry , and mining , geodetic surveys , and rescue and disaster relief , etc . 
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
The integrated system , which is composed of the direct-and-dispatch command , satellite - positioning , imagery-transmission , radio honeycomb communication , internal communication , display-and-control , and other sub-systems , and gave flexible and highly efficient direct-and-dispatch commands to and conducted whole-course monitoring and control on the units .  
With such a heroic spirit as " building a morale-boosting station " and " demonstrating national might " , the scientific research personnel concerned managed to pool wisdom and efforts of everyone and work hard with unreserved efforts and finally developed and built the first simulated satellite ground telecommunications station with China-made parts three months ahead of schedule .  
Thanks to the extensive application of such high-tech research achievements as satellite positioning systems , expert diagnostic systems , and distance support maintenance systems , the space of vast battlefields has been condensed in a tiny screen , in which equipment commanders assumed personal command in a " central command tent " and had the situation of the entire battlefields well in hand without going out , and they were moving units on the Web .  
Because the United States has become increasingly dependent on satellite support for conducting its political , economic , military , and diplomatic affairs in the past 50 years or so , it feels the pressing need to protect its vested interests in space .  
According to reports , Russia , in addition to taking active and passive defensive measures in developing its satellite systems , is also developing its antisatellite weapons on the basis of the operational antisatellite satellites , which the former Soviet Union developed , and on the basis of testing the land-based antisatellite laser weapons .  
China 's satellite project was developed under conditions where China 's basic industries were relatively weak , where the science and technology level was rather backward , and where the state finances were limited .  Through a long period of arduous struggle , by the end of the year 2000 , China altogether launched 48 different types of artificial satellites .  
We have utilized retrievable satellites to obtain a large quantity of valuable satellite remote sensing information , which has already been employed in resource investigation , cartology , geological surveying , selection of railway lines , and archaeological research .  
China fully put into play the extensive knowledge of its vast satellite engineering contingent .  Under fairly poor conditions , we constantly attacked key technologies , scoring a series of major achievements in satellite engineering , and at the same time constantly perfecting and strengthening all kinds of fundamental work in satellite engineering .  
Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
The paper 's technical facilities have developed from the mimeographs , planographic printing and rotary letterpress printing of that time to the advanced laser photocomposition systems and satellite transmission systems of today .  Not only can they now print in color , they can receive high quality prints directly from that same day 's People 's Daily and Cankao Xiaoxi .  
After the 1980s , advanced technology has been used in conducting geological investigation and research , such as global satellite positioning , GPS monitoring system , and aeronautical remote sensing technique , which has led to the establishment of the datum net for GPS monitoring in the reservoir area of the Three Gorges Project , and GPS net for monitoring local deformity .  
At the ongoing Beijing International Week , the Great Wall Rocket Company is a very eye-catching exhibitor .  Visitors are amazed by the gigantic models of the advanced carrier rockets of the Long March series , electronic traffic maps , sensors , satellite positioning and navigation instruments , TV receivers that can receive high-resolution pictures via satellites , and other high-tech civilian products on display at the company 's booths .  
The above two different early warning systems are known as " the air-based early warning system " and " the ground-based air target surveillance and tracking system " , respectively , with the former is formed mainly by the DSP satellite system , which is capable of sounding an early warning against an incoming missile , or its future replacement - - " the air-based infrared surveillance system " , and the latter by seven key early warning systems operated by the US Air Force Space Command and the US Navy Space Command , respectively . 
The SBIRS system is a new-generation satellite monitoring network being developed by the United States at the moment , for the purpose of locating and tracking an incoming missile , and the system is capable of processing a growing volume of data collected by four infrared air surveillance systems ( the system of early warning against an incoming missile , the missile defense system , the technological intelligence gathering system , and the system of identifying features of a battle zone ) .  
After the Kosovo war , the United States military and congress unanimously affirmed the policy decision to , after the Gulf war , strengthen the improvement and production of geographic information and precision guidance weapons .  At the same time , they decided , beginning in the year 2000 , to increase by $ 1.2-billion every year the money provided to install global satellite navigation reception equipment on more joint direct attack weapons , joint weapon-launching systems outside defensive areas , and bombs and missiles of joint voice channel monitoring weapons .  
General secretary of CPC Jiang Zemin pointed out at the meeting that " science and technology is the primary productive force as well an intensified representation and major symbol of the advanced productive force . "  Therefore , we must sharply capture the objective trend , advocate the " two bombs and one satellite " spirit carried on by the old generations of science and technology workers , never giving up pursuing the summit of science and technology .  
The degree of wild celebration and emotional reactions by the Chinese both at home and abroad to Beijing 's successful bid as seen on television and in news photos over the past several days is no less than those several major events since the founding of the People 's Republic , say , the successful explosion of the atomic and hydrogen bombs , the launch of a satellite into space , and China winning the first Olympic medal .  
When constructing new ports , roads , and railways and optic fiber and ground satellite projects , counties and cities in the coastal regions have fully considered the practical needs for coastal defense and incorporated them into unified planning and construction .  This is to ensure coordination in coastal defense management and economic development of coastal regions .  
Having made strenuous efforts to develop itself , China 's ocean-going space survey sector has finally acquired the world 's most advanced ocean-going survey and control technology , bringing about five tremendous leaps forward in this field , namely , from ground to sea , from surface to underwater , from inside the country to outside the country , from survey to survey and control , and from satellite to spaceship .  
As analyzed by the US media , Bush and Rumsfeld couldfind the most powerful support in Myers . Myers repeatedly emphasized the importance of satellite and space weapons systems in modern warfare when he addressed his almamater , Kansas State University , last year .  He did his best to play up the so-called " ballistic missile threat , " claiming that " weapons of mass destruction and vehicles that launch them to American cities are proliferating . "  
The key part of the exercise is beach landing , which includes topics of anti-landing , air raids and anti-air raids , parachuting , electronic jamming and anti-jamming , satellite surveillance and tracking , blockading and anti-blockading , attacking with tactical and strategic missiles , hitting aircraft carriers , hitting invisible aircraft , hitting cruise missiles , hitting helicopters , anti-precision attacks , anti-surveillance and anti-monitoring , and so on .  
This is specifically expressed in the following ways : The special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized is for the first time operating in the Taiwan strait in coordination with military satellite reconnaisance ;  
The spokesman for the Great Hall Industrial Company pointed out : We have noticed that recently the US media have devoted lots of space to carrying reports which state that the US State Department claimed that in the course of developing the perigee solid satellite motor ( EPKM ) in 1994 , it is possible that China received technological assistance from the Lockheed Martin Company .  
On 6 April , the " Washington Post " " New York Times " and other media in the United States devoted a large space to the report that the US State Department claimed that in the process of developing and manufacturing the perigee solid satellite motor ( EPKM ) in 1994 , it is possible that China received technological aid from the Lockheed Martin Company , and this has aroused the concerns of the Chinese and US space technology circles .

Thanks to the construction and development over the past half a century , a remarkable improvement has been registered in the overall surveying and mapping level of our army ; and the use of new and high technologies , represented by satellite positioning , remote surveying , digital mapping , and a military geographic information system , has provided a strong surveying and mapping support for the operational commanding of our army .  
At the Foreign Ministry news conference held today , in responding to a relevant question raised by a reporter , the spokesman reiterated : The statement which says China has probably acquired technical assistance from Lockheed Martin in the process of developing the satellite perigee kick motor is entirely groundless .  
Soon afterwards , Luo Gan went to the BMPSB 's police affairs center to watch the development of the Beijing municipal integrated public security information network and non-native population information system as well as a demonstration of the satellite positioning system for financial institution alarms and to hear reports on the state of the BMPSB 's science and technological planning for the 10th Five-Year Plan period and planning for the " Golden Shield Project . "  
An expert says that this achievement has filled a vacuum in domestic synchronous satellite technology for real-time tracking of transportation carriers such as cars , trains , and ships , to bring China up to the advanced international level .  
The highly effective application of aerospace technology in the fields of telecommunications , broadcast , meteorology , resources , satellite navigation and orientation , and so on has brought about tremendous changes in human productive forces and lifestyles and pushed forward economic development and social progress .  
set up a satellite ground application system combining sky and earth as a whole ; form a complete and independent sky-earth integrated network system capable of long-term and stable operations - - a sky-based comprehensive information system ;  
China has successfully launched more than 40 satellites of 15 categories it developed independently .  Of these satellites , the technology in the recoverable satellite has reached the world leading level , and the series of communication , meteorological , resources , and scientific research satellites have gradually been established .  
During the process of monitoring and controlling the Beidou Navigation Testing Satellite , the center directly issued several thousand commands to the satellite and received correct responses from the satellite , which indicated that the satellite is operating normally and revealed that the exchange of information between the satellite and the ground station were unclogged .  All this fully reflects the superiority of the " central remote control " transparent work model .  
Since China decided to launch a manned satellite in 1992 , the spaceflight scientific research department has solved many key technological problems and mustered many technologies .  The department successfully fired China 's first " Shenzhou " spaceship in November 1999 .  
integrated radio systems for mobile phone and paging services ; broadband ATM switch , mini telephone exchange and satellite transmission equipment ; a full range of telecommunications services , i.e . data , voice , Internet , satellite , etc . ; access to financial data and information databases ; centralised uninterrupted power supply for small businesses ; and backup generators for essential applications .  
In respect of the external facilities market , the package will favour investment in additional external cable capacity to meet the anticipated exponential growth in external telecommunication needs while offering an effectively " open sky " to encourage innovative uses of satellite and other wireless transmission means to provide broadcasting and multimedia services .  
" Crimes are committed beyond geographical and jurisdictional boundaries and the culprits are not present at the crime scene , operating through remote access via various electronic communication media such as fibre optics or satellite and microwave transmission capabilities provided by internet service providers and wired or wireless telecommunication service carriers . "  
The majority of the first settlers were engaged in farming . The rugged terrain , and damp climate encouraged the cultivation of tea and oranges . The past 30 years have seen Taiwan evolve from an agricultural based economy to that of an industrial-based nation . Industrial development in the Taipei basin spurred the growth of many satellite communities such as Yung Ho , Chung Ho and Pan Ch'iao .  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
The sky ca n't be reached in a single bound though , as the Chinese expression goes . For Taiwan to develop a satellite will be like a child learning to cook , watching and observing first and then starting out slowly with some simple dishes . The dishes may not look like much , but they can lay the foundation for more elaborate ones later . (  
Through the robust and healthy development of the public broadcasting system ( PBS ) , live programs can immediately be telecast or diffused by satellite via the medium of PBS . Ordinary antenna-type TV systems will include PBS channels , which will provide the public with a high standard of programming in the arts , sports , and culture .  
Some , holding that the many items relating to satellite communication technology involved national defense facilities , harbored suspicions that the Chinese communists had " evil intentions . " While economically there might be some small profits to be made , they feared that the national defense would be seriously damaged . Others thought that mainland research that had led to defense technology was far removed from commercial technology that could be profitably sold in the marketplace . They doubted whether Taiwan could use the Chinese communists ' strengths to improve R . O . C . technology .  
Cheng Shu-min , manager of program planning at Chinese Television System , also says that when you look at examples from overseas , audiences tend to identify with their native culture and we have yet to see terrestrial television stations closing down due to competition from satellite . Yet the rise of new electronic media technology has still made the networks aware of a change in the domestic market , a change which has seen a breaking up of the tripartite world of the three television channels and a movement towards audience fragmentation . "  
In August this year , satellite transmitters were attached to marine turtles on Penghu ; three years ago , a Formosan black bear was released into Yushan National Park wearing a radio collar ; and the squirrels scampering through the grass and up and down the tall tropical trees of Taipei Botanical Garden have been kitted out with modern high-tech products for several years now .  
A radio in every handIn the future shortwave broadcasting may be no competition for satellite TV , with its combined impact of both sound and image . But every time a major international incident occurs , the number of shortwave listeners increases .  
At any rate , the investment required to open a computer center is not nearly as monumental as a factory or an overseas branch operation . With the use of satellite communications it really was n't that difficult . As far as Hong Kong and Shanghai is concerned , we were simply turning circumstances to our advantage . " Lo reveals that several dozen employees have returned by this method .  
Bare earth and mud-brick buildings strongly reflect all three wavelengths , often showing a grey-white color . Water , on the other hand , strongly absorbs all three colors , so it appears as black in the satellite image . Meanwhile , verdant land comes out in red ( because , generally speaking , vegetation most strongly reflects near infra-red light ) , while cities appear in green .  
In the US , for example , residential and agricultural areas are clearly separate , and huge areas of agricultural land are often devoted to a single crop , so it is easy to differentiate the objects in the satellite image .  
Often many different crops are planted in a single small area ; small towns and large urban areas are not clearly defined and often are mixed together ; and there are rapid changes in construction . These make it difficult to interpret satellite images .  
Finding foreign partners for joint ventures is not difficult for medium to large-sized companies with substantial financial and technological resources , but " most Taiwanese medium or small businesses have few opportunities to find foreign partners except by becoming satellite companies of Japanese firms , " says Kenneth Lai .  
When speaking of this precious satellite , what worries those in charge is not only its exorbitant manufacturing cost of over NT $ 1.6 billion ( making it worth 20 times its weight in gold ) , but also that its original 1996 date of completion has already been exceeded by one year .  
Furthermore , the Executive Yuan clearly stated that a satellite launching system would not be developed . The primary goal of the current Satellite Project is to develop satellite and related applied technologies . The secondary goal is to promote basic and applied space research .  
While evaluating plans for ROCSAT-2 , the group decided that because synchronous satellites are vastly more complex than low-orbit satellites , and because it would be difficult to redirect the technical and human resources which were being built up through the ROCSAT-1 project , ROCSAT-2 would be redesignated as a low-orbit satellite .  
ROCSAT-1 is set to be launched at the end of next year , and although the project is progressing smoothly at present , it is understood that because satellite technology is extremely complex , and aerospace is a vast industry which can not be established overnight , there are still many challenges to be faced .  
The satellite project began in June 1994 , when the ROC commissioned the US firm TRW to build ROCSAT-1 . The ROC then selected 28 technicians to go to the US to observe the design and construction . The ROC also requested that TRW transfer the technology necessary to build some of the components . Local firms such as Acer , TranSystems Inc . and Shihlin Electronics then became involved , building the satellite 's onboard computer , its remote interface unit and its solar power panels , respectively .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
Yu Shui-pei , a researcher at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of Earth Sciences , is intimately acquainted with the wriggling , writhing ways of this island we live on . In 1990 he began installing sensitive instruments around the island to measure their precise positions using a satellite positioning system .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
Late 1996 saw the launching of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) satellite , which was built in a collaborative project between the European Space Agency and NASA . SOHO 's missions include studying the sun 's internal structure and outer atmosphere , and the solar wind . But satellite observations are immensely costly , and satellites have a limited service life and a high risk of failure .  
Information sent on wireless communication systems , including mobile phone platforms , satellite TV , and broadband Internet access , may very well be in a digital format , but in the actual process of transmission , the data must first be converted using an analog transponder from digital to mid frequency signals , and thereafter be switched to high frequency . Only in this way can it get on to the high frequency information superhighway . When it arrives at the receiving end , it must go through the same steps in reverse .  
Through satellite observations , the fishing industry has gradually come to understand the waxing and waning of cold and warm currents . Noting the succession of warm winters in the 1990s , and a 1 �X C rise in sea temperatures around Taiwan , the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute also began making fish catch forecasts based on sea temperatures . For instance , the temperature that best suits mullet is 21-23 �X C , but last year the institute predicted that sea temperatures around southern Taiwan would be 2-3 �X C warmer this winter than in previous years .  
" All told , Taiwan has over 70 free-to-air , cable and satellite TV stations . To put a positive gloss on it you could say this is a sign of a vibrant industry , but with such intense competition , many stations feel that producing drama series of their own is too costly and risky , so they prefer to buy ready-made Japanese , Korean or mainland offerings . With the large influx of drama from abroad , in fact the biggest losers have been Taiwanese film and TV production organizations , " laments Andy Wang .  
" Beginning in 2002 , the communist authorities founded the Overseas Satellite Agency . All legally authorized satellite TV stations will broadcast via the SinoSat 3 satellite which will be managed in a unified manner , " says Asia Plus Broadcasting 's Sammy Yang . In the future , all foreign-based satellite TV stations will have to play under the same set of rules and equal access , thus giving Taiwan a relatively fair opportunity to compete .  
The data collected by low-elevation weather stations lacks detailed information on high altitude cloud cover and air current changes , among other things . Although it is now possible to use satellite technology , high-altitude weather balloons and other advanced technology to measure the temperature , air pressure and humidity at high altitudes , the collection of data on such things as visibility , cloud type and cloud height depends on visual observation and can not be achieved by automated instruments .  
according to experts , the satellite launched today is expected to fly in space for half a month in addition to scientific surveys , it also carries technical experimental devices for plant and animal micro cells and industrial micro gravity  
There has also been a holistic review of the current and future potential of remotely sensed data ( satellite and airborne ) for identification and monitoring of illicit crops ( that is , opium poppy , cannabis and coca ) .  
The objective of the satellite network proposal is to provide reliable , economic and secure international telecommunications services , capable of supporting global operations 24 hours a day , seven days a week .  
It was observed that ITU at its Radio Communication Assembly in 1993 had adopted a recommendation ( A / AC . 105 / C . 1 / CRP . 4 ) containing a definition of the geostationary orbit as a torus of thickness 600 kilometres around a mean Earth radius of 42,164 kilometres , extending to 15 degrees north and south latitudes , and that a satellite under such a definition could not be considered to be at a fixed position with regard to a point on the surface of the Earth .  
Conclusion : The Expert Group took into account the fact that there are close analytical links between these classifications , as they are increasingly being used in comprehensive analyses of expanded national accounting systems based on the 1993 SNA , social accounting matrices and satellite accounts .  
Efforts are needed to acknowledge the social and economic importance and value of unremunerated work and to facilitate labour force participation in combination with such work through flexible working arrangements , encouraging voluntary social activities as well as broadening the very conception of productive work and to accord social recognition for such work [ including , by reflecting its value in the satellite accounts of the gross national product ] .  
Provision of technical advisory services upon request to Member States on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science and satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in such fields ;  
From the first radio call by the voluntary police , who in turn activated the national satellite communications system , to the voluntary response of neighbours who searched through the rubble for injured victims , reports document that individuals and groups initiated collective action based upon the information immediately available .  
Support is provided by United Nations specialized agencies to each of these programmes , in which satellite observation and electronic communications systems are employed along with conventional national and regional telecommunications systems for the interpretation and dissemination of early-warning information for participating countries .  
The event could also include an exposition of traditional and improved farmers ' instruments , artisanal products of rural communities from various parts of the developing world , a photo exhibit , stands for publications , a video show and a musical programme , while the African and international media would cover the event through national and satellite television networks .  
38 The growing awareness and consideration of these societal issues together with advances in spaceborne technology mean that effective , affordable and global mobile satellite communications and remote sensing capabilities that should significantly reduce the devastating effects of natural disasters should soon be implemented .  
64 A more effective coordination policy must be established in many developing countries in order to integrate satellite remote sensing into national , social and economic development programmes .  
The FS initiated partnerships with international , Federal , State , and private organizations for ecosystem assessment , leading to greater use of satellite data and increased understanding of global ecological processes .  
6 Presentations delivered during the Symposium addressed the issue of how satellite remote sensing and satellite communications could provide accurate and timely information considered to be essential for policy formulation and effective decision-making in developing countries .  
Those areas included ensuring the continuity of remote sensing data from satellite operators , technical assistance in the implementation and operation of ground stations , price reductions and easier access to data , provision of training and education for efficient and timely data processing and analysis , and increased efforts in the coordination of programmes and projects between national , regional and international aid agencies .  
This presentation selectively describes basic aspects of satellite remote sensing and geographic information systems ( GIS ) which must be sufficiently appreciated by users of remotely sensed data for their effective application to the national development problems or academic issues identified by the participants .  
We are all aware that we live in an age when political decisions can be influenced by the emotional power of visual images , whose instant , worldwide transmission has been made possible by rapid-fire advances in everything from satellite technology to personal computers .  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
Nile basin : Through the effective development of an operational remote sensing capacity to receive Meteosat satellite imagery for the Blue and White Nile data , Meteosat derived rainfall information is calibrated and fed into forecasting models to provide up to three weeks ' advance notice of river flow at critical points along the Blue Nile ;  
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
SAC-B is an Argentine-American satellite designed to advance the study of solar physics and astrophysics through the examination of solar flares , gamma ray bursts , diffuse X-ray cosmic background , and energetic neutral atoms .  SAC-B , a 181-kg . spacecraft , will be launched into orbit by a Pegasus-XL rocket .  
The new ARIANE-5 launcher has a dual purpose : first , to make the ARIANE family more competitive by enhancing performance levels , reducing launch costs , improving reliability and increasing the useful diameter under the fairing , so that ARIANE-5 will be capable of launching into geostationary transfer orbit either two-3,000 kilogram satellites simultaneously or a single satellite of up to 6,800 kilograms ; second , to satisfy Europe 's need for a low-orbit facility using manned vehicles or space station sections .  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Fixed satellite communications had given noticeable support to the growth of global , regional , national and local networks for government institutions and private enterprises in their daily operations .  
With the successful design , development , launch and in-orbit performance of the first generation of the Indian remote sensing satellite ( IRS ) , India was surging ahead to provide improved and enhanced data services from the second generation remote sensing satellites , IRS-1C and IRS-1D . IRS-1C , which was launched on 6 December 1995 , was characterized by an improved spatial resolution , extended spectral bands , stereo viewing and faster revisit capability .  
The tools available are assessment based on analysis of existing reliable country information ( already applied for the developing countries ) , sampling of high resolution satellite data ( already applied for tropical countries ) , organization of existing reliable information using GIS ( already applied for developing countries ) , questionnaires supported by a network of country correspondents ( applied in industrialized countries ) , and special studies undertaken by consultants or cooperating partners .  
The limited mass , volume , stability and optics of microsatellites could not compete with traditional large-scale missions such as the Land Remote Sensing Satellite ( LANDSAT ) , Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) and the European remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) ; however , for medium resolution and meteorological-scale imaging , the KITSAT and POSAT satellites had demonstrated a comparable facility but at a tiny fraction of the cost .  
Today , the infrastructure in remote and rural areas can be significantly improved through satellite remote sensing , particularly with respect to natural disaster warning and mitigation , management of water , forest and food resources , planning and operation of transport systems and other supporting activities relating to social and economic development .  
Among other issues , the use of modern satellite telecommunications technology for supporting a range of services such as telephone , distance education and health-care services and the attendant improvement in the quality of life in remote and rural areas was demonstrated .  
Following the decision of the Committee to promote international cooperation in space science and technology , the United Nations Programme on Space Applications was established with the objective , inter alia , of providing scientists from developing countries with educational programmes in remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite communication and basic space science .  
The presentations at the Workshop covered remote sensing , satellite communications and broadcasting in combination with electronic networking , satellite meteorology , satellite positioning systems and how they could be used , separately or in combination , to prevent , warn , monitor and mitigate the effects of disasters such as flooding , drought , landslides , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , fires , environmental degradation and regional and global phenomena such as El Ni �� .  
The Workshop recommended that civil defence institutions of the region , in collaboration with outside entities , should develop mechanisms based on existing infrastructures that incorporate the use of satellite communications , remote sensing , global positioning and other space technologies for the prevention , early warning and mitigation of the effects of disasters .  
He also noted that the Secretariat , as requested by the Subcommittee at its previous session in 1996 , had submitted a working paper entitled An analysis of the compatibility of the approach contained in the working paper entitled Some considerations concerning the utilization of the geostationary satellite orbit with the existing regulatory procedures of the International Telecommunication Union relating to the use of the geostationary orbit ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 205 ) .  
The Working Group was informed that the fifth preambular paragraph recalled the fact that the a priori allocation plans adopted by the ITU administrative radio conferences guaranteed equitable access to the geostationary satellite orbit and the radio frequencies for direct broadcasting satellite and fixed satellite services . 
The view was expressed that reference to practical problems in the implementation of equitable access to the geostationary satellite orbit presupposed that there were no prior legal problems in the implementation of equitable access , particularly for the developing countries .  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
There is an increased use in the region of satellite imagery and global positioning systems ( GPS ) ; geodetic networks are being improved ; and there is a continuing need to maintain topographic and thematic mapping and a priority need to produce data and maps in support of cadastre .  
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth , and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
To reinforce understanding of the principles of image interpretation , participants were divided on a regional basis into groups , each of which studied a case history where visual interpretation of satellite images played a key role .  
Technologies associated with space-based and terrestrial remote sensing , geographic information systems , satellite observation and communications , mathematical modelling of event scenarios , and the entire field of global communications have revolutionized the ability to monitor , analyze and disseminate accurate and timely information about natural hazards .  
While developing countries did not constitute a viable market for most of the large-scale satellite communication projects , they benefited from lucrative markets in the industrialized countries that lured international commercial programmes , and might be able to take advantage of the excess capacity of those programmes to satisfy their own communication needs .  
A wide range of applications were planned through those services , including distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work-groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , wireless backbone interconnection ( that is , wireless Local Area Network-Wide Area Network ) , video distribution , DTH video and satellite newsgathering , as well as the distribution of software , music , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
The system would complement the existing spatial high-resolution capabilities of the SPOT satellite series , providing simultaneous spectral measurements in the visible and short-wave infrared domain of the electromagnetic spectrum .  
The United Nations Statistics Division has been very active in the development of satellite accounts , and proposed a system for integrated environment and economic accounting ( SEEA ) , which was published in 1993.6 Several industrialized and developing countries are presently experimenting with the implementation of satellite accounts through the general application of the SEEA framework to a specific national context ( see box 6 ) . 
The major activities included the completion of a full environmental test campaign ( thermal vacuum , vibration , RF , and mass properties measurements ) on the Canadian MSAT M1 satellite ( successfully launched on 20 April 1996 ) , and the initiation of environmental testing on the various components ( motor modules , joints , latching end effectors , and the mobile base system ) for Canada 's contribution to the international Space Station Project , the Mobile Servicing System .  
It also runs specific projects related to : the use of infrared imagery for public agencies , academic and other research institutions ; thermal loss in urban areas ; and the use of NOAA satellite images for the operational definition of cloud systems .

In the view of one State , because of the successive flights of the United States Space Shuttle through the airspace of many third States , these could be considered as precedents of innocent passage , and since no opposition or objection had been raised , an international customary-law right had thus been created by such passage , analogous to the case of the first artificial Earth satellite .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
In the course of the discussion , delegations reviewed national and international cooperative programmes in satellite communications , including progress in communications satellite technology that would make satellite communications more accessible and less expensive and would increase the communications capacity of the geostationary orbit and the electromagnetic spectrum .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
The approach represents the satellite as a combination of individual elements and positions these to provide maximum protection to the satellite components .  [ 29 ] The PLATFORM model uses a novel element termed SHIELD [ 30 ] which uses genetic algorithms to determine the optimal configuration of a spacecraft based on the encountered environment and design constraints such as thermal and mass balancing .  
This is also necessary for an optimal combination with emerging satellite systems , which are complementary to terrestrial systems and fundamental for the rapid global expansion of services .  
The first series of SCD satellites manufactured in Brazil , designed for environmental data collection , had proved a success , the development of the necessary technologies for the Brazilian satellite launching vehicle had been completed , progress had also been made in the implementation of the joint Chinese-Brazilian project on the remote sensing of earth resources , and a cooperation agreement had been concluded with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .  
While saluting the efforts of the document 's authors , his delegation considered that it might be possible to make a less rigorous procedure for access to the geostationary orbit available solely to systems intended exclusively to serve the territory of a specific developing country and not to provide an international link , but not to the so-called " paper " satellite systems . 
In comparison with the satellite systems previously deployed in the mission area which are based on a single-channel portable satellite terminal and not capable of simultaneous transmissions , the very small aperture terminal ( VSAT ) earth stations are required to enhance MONUA communications infrastructure by providing the capability for permanent and simultaneous voice , facsimile and data transmission .  
Weather forecasts based on numerical weather prediction utilize , among other things , operational satellite measurements of both surface and upper air winds and atmospheric temperature fields ;  
Another area of greatest need is the development of small satellite technology , which has strong potential for offering a larger number of countries affordable access to space through the rapid development of fully integrated national space programmes .  
France is making a contribution to the Odin scientific satellite developed by Sweden and intended for the observation of the as yet unstudied electromagnetic spectral bands situated in the neighbourhood of wavelengths between 0.5 and 3 mm .  
The most dramatic and economically successful application of space technology , the communication satellite , has been the greatest boon to national , regional and global economic and social development .  
There is an increasing trend of more joint satellite missions , both on a national basis ( e.g . by merging military and civilian systems ) and through international cooperation .  
With rising worldwide demand for mobile satellite services , especially in developing countries , which often lack an adequate terrestrial telephone line infrastructure , planned LEO and MEO systems will supplement GEO satellite communications services .  
While the current personal mobile satellite communication systems were designed to provide data rates sufficient for messaging services and voice data , future systems were designed to support broadband applications .  
In the later case , a central , larger hub station connected via the space segment to the various remote sites , which were equipped with small , simple and relatively cheap satellite antennas .  
The broad base of users was one reason why satellite communications had developed into a strong market , while the remote sensing data market was still in a somewhat developmental stage , although slowly growing .  
To reinforce the understanding of the principles of image interpretation , participants were divided into groups on a regional basis ; each group studied a case where visual interpretation of satellite images played a key role .

The aforementioned figures of continuous deforestation evidenced by satellite photos show that damages to the Amazon caused by cattle farming have been greater than those caused by lumbering and the ongoing expansion of soybean cultivation , both of which have been the focus of extensive media coverage .  
At the drilling ground this correspondent saw professional support team members carry out emergency repair work on telecommunication optical fiber cables that had been destroyed by the " enemy , " and use modern telecommunication equipment , such as maritime-type portable satellite telephones and VSAT small-sized satellite ground stations , under electronic jamming condition , to serve the purpose of war-time mobile telecommunication support .  
Wei Ziqing ( researcher and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering ) : The use of satellite navigation is extremely widespread , from outer space to the land and sea , and from military and economic activities to our human and social lives , it reaches every trade and industry , e.g . , space navigation , determining satellite orbits , space surveys and mapping , weapons guidance , traffic and transportation , agriculture , forestry , and mining , geodetic surveys , and rescue and disaster relief , etc . 
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
The integrated system , which is composed of the direct-and-dispatch command , satellite - positioning , imagery-transmission , radio honeycomb communication , internal communication , display-and-control , and other sub-systems , and gave flexible and highly efficient direct-and-dispatch commands to and conducted whole-course monitoring and control on the units .  
With such a heroic spirit as " building a morale-boosting station " and " demonstrating national might " , the scientific research personnel concerned managed to pool wisdom and efforts of everyone and work hard with unreserved efforts and finally developed and built the first simulated satellite ground telecommunications station with China-made parts three months ahead of schedule .  
Thanks to the extensive application of such high-tech research achievements as satellite positioning systems , expert diagnostic systems , and distance support maintenance systems , the space of vast battlefields has been condensed in a tiny screen , in which equipment commanders assumed personal command in a " central command tent " and had the situation of the entire battlefields well in hand without going out , and they were moving units on the Web .  
Because the United States has become increasingly dependent on satellite support for conducting its political , economic , military , and diplomatic affairs in the past 50 years or so , it feels the pressing need to protect its vested interests in space .  
According to reports , Russia , in addition to taking active and passive defensive measures in developing its satellite systems , is also developing its antisatellite weapons on the basis of the operational antisatellite satellites , which the former Soviet Union developed , and on the basis of testing the land-based antisatellite laser weapons .  
China 's satellite project was developed under conditions where China 's basic industries were relatively weak , where the science and technology level was rather backward , and where the state finances were limited .  Through a long period of arduous struggle , by the end of the year 2000 , China altogether launched 48 different types of artificial satellites .  
We have utilized retrievable satellites to obtain a large quantity of valuable satellite remote sensing information , which has already been employed in resource investigation , cartology , geological surveying , selection of railway lines , and archaeological research .  
China fully put into play the extensive knowledge of its vast satellite engineering contingent .  Under fairly poor conditions , we constantly attacked key technologies , scoring a series of major achievements in satellite engineering , and at the same time constantly perfecting and strengthening all kinds of fundamental work in satellite engineering .  
Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
The paper 's technical facilities have developed from the mimeographs , planographic printing and rotary letterpress printing of that time to the advanced laser photocomposition systems and satellite transmission systems of today .  Not only can they now print in color , they can receive high quality prints directly from that same day 's People 's Daily and Cankao Xiaoxi .  
After the 1980s , advanced technology has been used in conducting geological investigation and research , such as global satellite positioning , GPS monitoring system , and aeronautical remote sensing technique , which has led to the establishment of the datum net for GPS monitoring in the reservoir area of the Three Gorges Project , and GPS net for monitoring local deformity .  
At the ongoing Beijing International Week , the Great Wall Rocket Company is a very eye-catching exhibitor .  Visitors are amazed by the gigantic models of the advanced carrier rockets of the Long March series , electronic traffic maps , sensors , satellite positioning and navigation instruments , TV receivers that can receive high-resolution pictures via satellites , and other high-tech civilian products on display at the company 's booths .  
The above two different early warning systems are known as " the air-based early warning system " and " the ground-based air target surveillance and tracking system " , respectively , with the former is formed mainly by the DSP satellite system , which is capable of sounding an early warning against an incoming missile , or its future replacement - - " the air-based infrared surveillance system " , and the latter by seven key early warning systems operated by the US Air Force Space Command and the US Navy Space Command , respectively . 
The SBIRS system is a new-generation satellite monitoring network being developed by the United States at the moment , for the purpose of locating and tracking an incoming missile , and the system is capable of processing a growing volume of data collected by four infrared air surveillance systems ( the system of early warning against an incoming missile , the missile defense system , the technological intelligence gathering system , and the system of identifying features of a battle zone ) .  
After the Kosovo war , the United States military and congress unanimously affirmed the policy decision to , after the Gulf war , strengthen the improvement and production of geographic information and precision guidance weapons .  At the same time , they decided , beginning in the year 2000 , to increase by $ 1.2-billion every year the money provided to install global satellite navigation reception equipment on more joint direct attack weapons , joint weapon-launching systems outside defensive areas , and bombs and missiles of joint voice channel monitoring weapons .  
General secretary of CPC Jiang Zemin pointed out at the meeting that " science and technology is the primary productive force as well an intensified representation and major symbol of the advanced productive force . "  Therefore , we must sharply capture the objective trend , advocate the " two bombs and one satellite " spirit carried on by the old generations of science and technology workers , never giving up pursuing the summit of science and technology .  
The degree of wild celebration and emotional reactions by the Chinese both at home and abroad to Beijing 's successful bid as seen on television and in news photos over the past several days is no less than those several major events since the founding of the People 's Republic , say , the successful explosion of the atomic and hydrogen bombs , the launch of a satellite into space , and China winning the first Olympic medal .  
When constructing new ports , roads , and railways and optic fiber and ground satellite projects , counties and cities in the coastal regions have fully considered the practical needs for coastal defense and incorporated them into unified planning and construction .  This is to ensure coordination in coastal defense management and economic development of coastal regions .  
Having made strenuous efforts to develop itself , China 's ocean-going space survey sector has finally acquired the world 's most advanced ocean-going survey and control technology , bringing about five tremendous leaps forward in this field , namely , from ground to sea , from surface to underwater , from inside the country to outside the country , from survey to survey and control , and from satellite to spaceship .  
As analyzed by the US media , Bush and Rumsfeld couldfind the most powerful support in Myers . Myers repeatedly emphasized the importance of satellite and space weapons systems in modern warfare when he addressed his almamater , Kansas State University , last year .  He did his best to play up the so-called " ballistic missile threat , " claiming that " weapons of mass destruction and vehicles that launch them to American cities are proliferating . "  
The key part of the exercise is beach landing , which includes topics of anti-landing , air raids and anti-air raids , parachuting , electronic jamming and anti-jamming , satellite surveillance and tracking , blockading and anti-blockading , attacking with tactical and strategic missiles , hitting aircraft carriers , hitting invisible aircraft , hitting cruise missiles , hitting helicopters , anti-precision attacks , anti-surveillance and anti-monitoring , and so on .  
This is specifically expressed in the following ways : The special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized is for the first time operating in the Taiwan strait in coordination with military satellite reconnaisance ;  
The spokesman for the Great Hall Industrial Company pointed out : We have noticed that recently the US media have devoted lots of space to carrying reports which state that the US State Department claimed that in the course of developing the perigee solid satellite motor ( EPKM ) in 1994 , it is possible that China received technological assistance from the Lockheed Martin Company .  
On 6 April , the " Washington Post " " New York Times " and other media in the United States devoted a large space to the report that the US State Department claimed that in the process of developing and manufacturing the perigee solid satellite motor ( EPKM ) in 1994 , it is possible that China received technological aid from the Lockheed Martin Company , and this has aroused the concerns of the Chinese and US space technology circles .

Thanks to the construction and development over the past half a century , a remarkable improvement has been registered in the overall surveying and mapping level of our army ; and the use of new and high technologies , represented by satellite positioning , remote surveying , digital mapping , and a military geographic information system , has provided a strong surveying and mapping support for the operational commanding of our army .  
At the Foreign Ministry news conference held today , in responding to a relevant question raised by a reporter , the spokesman reiterated : The statement which says China has probably acquired technical assistance from Lockheed Martin in the process of developing the satellite perigee kick motor is entirely groundless .  
Soon afterwards , Luo Gan went to the BMPSB 's police affairs center to watch the development of the Beijing municipal integrated public security information network and non-native population information system as well as a demonstration of the satellite positioning system for financial institution alarms and to hear reports on the state of the BMPSB 's science and technological planning for the 10th Five-Year Plan period and planning for the " Golden Shield Project . "  
An expert says that this achievement has filled a vacuum in domestic synchronous satellite technology for real-time tracking of transportation carriers such as cars , trains , and ships , to bring China up to the advanced international level .  
The highly effective application of aerospace technology in the fields of telecommunications , broadcast , meteorology , resources , satellite navigation and orientation , and so on has brought about tremendous changes in human productive forces and lifestyles and pushed forward economic development and social progress .  
set up a satellite ground application system combining sky and earth as a whole ; form a complete and independent sky-earth integrated network system capable of long-term and stable operations - - a sky-based comprehensive information system ;  
China has successfully launched more than 40 satellites of 15 categories it developed independently .  Of these satellites , the technology in the recoverable satellite has reached the world leading level , and the series of communication , meteorological , resources , and scientific research satellites have gradually been established .  
During the process of monitoring and controlling the Beidou Navigation Testing Satellite , the center directly issued several thousand commands to the satellite and received correct responses from the satellite , which indicated that the satellite is operating normally and revealed that the exchange of information between the satellite and the ground station were unclogged .  All this fully reflects the superiority of the " central remote control " transparent work model .  
Since China decided to launch a manned satellite in 1992 , the spaceflight scientific research department has solved many key technological problems and mustered many technologies .  The department successfully fired China 's first " Shenzhou " spaceship in November 1999 .  
integrated radio systems for mobile phone and paging services ; broadband ATM switch , mini telephone exchange and satellite transmission equipment ; a full range of telecommunications services , i.e . data , voice , Internet , satellite , etc . ; access to financial data and information databases ; centralised uninterrupted power supply for small businesses ; and backup generators for essential applications .  
In respect of the external facilities market , the package will favour investment in additional external cable capacity to meet the anticipated exponential growth in external telecommunication needs while offering an effectively " open sky " to encourage innovative uses of satellite and other wireless transmission means to provide broadcasting and multimedia services .  
" Crimes are committed beyond geographical and jurisdictional boundaries and the culprits are not present at the crime scene , operating through remote access via various electronic communication media such as fibre optics or satellite and microwave transmission capabilities provided by internet service providers and wired or wireless telecommunication service carriers . "  
The majority of the first settlers were engaged in farming . The rugged terrain , and damp climate encouraged the cultivation of tea and oranges . The past 30 years have seen Taiwan evolve from an agricultural based economy to that of an industrial-based nation . Industrial development in the Taipei basin spurred the growth of many satellite communities such as Yung Ho , Chung Ho and Pan Ch'iao .  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
The sky ca n't be reached in a single bound though , as the Chinese expression goes . For Taiwan to develop a satellite will be like a child learning to cook , watching and observing first and then starting out slowly with some simple dishes . The dishes may not look like much , but they can lay the foundation for more elaborate ones later . (  
Through the robust and healthy development of the public broadcasting system ( PBS ) , live programs can immediately be telecast or diffused by satellite via the medium of PBS . Ordinary antenna-type TV systems will include PBS channels , which will provide the public with a high standard of programming in the arts , sports , and culture .  
Some , holding that the many items relating to satellite communication technology involved national defense facilities , harbored suspicions that the Chinese communists had " evil intentions . " While economically there might be some small profits to be made , they feared that the national defense would be seriously damaged . Others thought that mainland research that had led to defense technology was far removed from commercial technology that could be profitably sold in the marketplace . They doubted whether Taiwan could use the Chinese communists ' strengths to improve R . O . C . technology .  
Cheng Shu-min , manager of program planning at Chinese Television System , also says that when you look at examples from overseas , audiences tend to identify with their native culture and we have yet to see terrestrial television stations closing down due to competition from satellite . Yet the rise of new electronic media technology has still made the networks aware of a change in the domestic market , a change which has seen a breaking up of the tripartite world of the three television channels and a movement towards audience fragmentation . "  
In August this year , satellite transmitters were attached to marine turtles on Penghu ; three years ago , a Formosan black bear was released into Yushan National Park wearing a radio collar ; and the squirrels scampering through the grass and up and down the tall tropical trees of Taipei Botanical Garden have been kitted out with modern high-tech products for several years now .  
A radio in every handIn the future shortwave broadcasting may be no competition for satellite TV , with its combined impact of both sound and image . But every time a major international incident occurs , the number of shortwave listeners increases .  
At any rate , the investment required to open a computer center is not nearly as monumental as a factory or an overseas branch operation . With the use of satellite communications it really was n't that difficult . As far as Hong Kong and Shanghai is concerned , we were simply turning circumstances to our advantage . " Lo reveals that several dozen employees have returned by this method .  
Bare earth and mud-brick buildings strongly reflect all three wavelengths , often showing a grey-white color . Water , on the other hand , strongly absorbs all three colors , so it appears as black in the satellite image . Meanwhile , verdant land comes out in red ( because , generally speaking , vegetation most strongly reflects near infra-red light ) , while cities appear in green .  
In the US , for example , residential and agricultural areas are clearly separate , and huge areas of agricultural land are often devoted to a single crop , so it is easy to differentiate the objects in the satellite image .  
Often many different crops are planted in a single small area ; small towns and large urban areas are not clearly defined and often are mixed together ; and there are rapid changes in construction . These make it difficult to interpret satellite images .  
Finding foreign partners for joint ventures is not difficult for medium to large-sized companies with substantial financial and technological resources , but " most Taiwanese medium or small businesses have few opportunities to find foreign partners except by becoming satellite companies of Japanese firms , " says Kenneth Lai .  
When speaking of this precious satellite , what worries those in charge is not only its exorbitant manufacturing cost of over NT $ 1.6 billion ( making it worth 20 times its weight in gold ) , but also that its original 1996 date of completion has already been exceeded by one year .  
Furthermore , the Executive Yuan clearly stated that a satellite launching system would not be developed . The primary goal of the current Satellite Project is to develop satellite and related applied technologies . The secondary goal is to promote basic and applied space research .  
While evaluating plans for ROCSAT-2 , the group decided that because synchronous satellites are vastly more complex than low-orbit satellites , and because it would be difficult to redirect the technical and human resources which were being built up through the ROCSAT-1 project , ROCSAT-2 would be redesignated as a low-orbit satellite .  
ROCSAT-1 is set to be launched at the end of next year , and although the project is progressing smoothly at present , it is understood that because satellite technology is extremely complex , and aerospace is a vast industry which can not be established overnight , there are still many challenges to be faced .  
The satellite project began in June 1994 , when the ROC commissioned the US firm TRW to build ROCSAT-1 . The ROC then selected 28 technicians to go to the US to observe the design and construction . The ROC also requested that TRW transfer the technology necessary to build some of the components . Local firms such as Acer , TranSystems Inc . and Shihlin Electronics then became involved , building the satellite 's onboard computer , its remote interface unit and its solar power panels , respectively .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
Yu Shui-pei , a researcher at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of Earth Sciences , is intimately acquainted with the wriggling , writhing ways of this island we live on . In 1990 he began installing sensitive instruments around the island to measure their precise positions using a satellite positioning system .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
Late 1996 saw the launching of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) satellite , which was built in a collaborative project between the European Space Agency and NASA . SOHO 's missions include studying the sun 's internal structure and outer atmosphere , and the solar wind . But satellite observations are immensely costly , and satellites have a limited service life and a high risk of failure .  
Information sent on wireless communication systems , including mobile phone platforms , satellite TV , and broadband Internet access , may very well be in a digital format , but in the actual process of transmission , the data must first be converted using an analog transponder from digital to mid frequency signals , and thereafter be switched to high frequency . Only in this way can it get on to the high frequency information superhighway . When it arrives at the receiving end , it must go through the same steps in reverse .  
Through satellite observations , the fishing industry has gradually come to understand the waxing and waning of cold and warm currents . Noting the succession of warm winters in the 1990s , and a 1 �X C rise in sea temperatures around Taiwan , the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute also began making fish catch forecasts based on sea temperatures . For instance , the temperature that best suits mullet is 21-23 �X C , but last year the institute predicted that sea temperatures around southern Taiwan would be 2-3 �X C warmer this winter than in previous years .  
" All told , Taiwan has over 70 free-to-air , cable and satellite TV stations . To put a positive gloss on it you could say this is a sign of a vibrant industry , but with such intense competition , many stations feel that producing drama series of their own is too costly and risky , so they prefer to buy ready-made Japanese , Korean or mainland offerings . With the large influx of drama from abroad , in fact the biggest losers have been Taiwanese film and TV production organizations , " laments Andy Wang .  
" Beginning in 2002 , the communist authorities founded the Overseas Satellite Agency . All legally authorized satellite TV stations will broadcast via the SinoSat 3 satellite which will be managed in a unified manner , " says Asia Plus Broadcasting 's Sammy Yang . In the future , all foreign-based satellite TV stations will have to play under the same set of rules and equal access , thus giving Taiwan a relatively fair opportunity to compete .  
The data collected by low-elevation weather stations lacks detailed information on high altitude cloud cover and air current changes , among other things . Although it is now possible to use satellite technology , high-altitude weather balloons and other advanced technology to measure the temperature , air pressure and humidity at high altitudes , the collection of data on such things as visibility , cloud type and cloud height depends on visual observation and can not be achieved by automated instruments .  
according to experts , the satellite launched today is expected to fly in space for half a month in addition to scientific surveys , it also carries technical experimental devices for plant and animal micro cells and industrial micro gravity  
There has also been a holistic review of the current and future potential of remotely sensed data ( satellite and airborne ) for identification and monitoring of illicit crops ( that is , opium poppy , cannabis and coca ) .  
The objective of the satellite network proposal is to provide reliable , economic and secure international telecommunications services , capable of supporting global operations 24 hours a day , seven days a week .  
It was observed that ITU at its Radio Communication Assembly in 1993 had adopted a recommendation ( A / AC . 105 / C . 1 / CRP . 4 ) containing a definition of the geostationary orbit as a torus of thickness 600 kilometres around a mean Earth radius of 42,164 kilometres , extending to 15 degrees north and south latitudes , and that a satellite under such a definition could not be considered to be at a fixed position with regard to a point on the surface of the Earth .  
Conclusion : The Expert Group took into account the fact that there are close analytical links between these classifications , as they are increasingly being used in comprehensive analyses of expanded national accounting systems based on the 1993 SNA , social accounting matrices and satellite accounts .  
Efforts are needed to acknowledge the social and economic importance and value of unremunerated work and to facilitate labour force participation in combination with such work through flexible working arrangements , encouraging voluntary social activities as well as broadening the very conception of productive work and to accord social recognition for such work [ including , by reflecting its value in the satellite accounts of the gross national product ] .  
Provision of technical advisory services upon request to Member States on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science and satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in such fields ;  
From the first radio call by the voluntary police , who in turn activated the national satellite communications system , to the voluntary response of neighbours who searched through the rubble for injured victims , reports document that individuals and groups initiated collective action based upon the information immediately available .  
Support is provided by United Nations specialized agencies to each of these programmes , in which satellite observation and electronic communications systems are employed along with conventional national and regional telecommunications systems for the interpretation and dissemination of early-warning information for participating countries .  
The event could also include an exposition of traditional and improved farmers ' instruments , artisanal products of rural communities from various parts of the developing world , a photo exhibit , stands for publications , a video show and a musical programme , while the African and international media would cover the event through national and satellite television networks .  
38 The growing awareness and consideration of these societal issues together with advances in spaceborne technology mean that effective , affordable and global mobile satellite communications and remote sensing capabilities that should significantly reduce the devastating effects of natural disasters should soon be implemented .  
64 A more effective coordination policy must be established in many developing countries in order to integrate satellite remote sensing into national , social and economic development programmes .  
The FS initiated partnerships with international , Federal , State , and private organizations for ecosystem assessment , leading to greater use of satellite data and increased understanding of global ecological processes .  
6 Presentations delivered during the Symposium addressed the issue of how satellite remote sensing and satellite communications could provide accurate and timely information considered to be essential for policy formulation and effective decision-making in developing countries .  
Those areas included ensuring the continuity of remote sensing data from satellite operators , technical assistance in the implementation and operation of ground stations , price reductions and easier access to data , provision of training and education for efficient and timely data processing and analysis , and increased efforts in the coordination of programmes and projects between national , regional and international aid agencies .  
This presentation selectively describes basic aspects of satellite remote sensing and geographic information systems ( GIS ) which must be sufficiently appreciated by users of remotely sensed data for their effective application to the national development problems or academic issues identified by the participants .  
We are all aware that we live in an age when political decisions can be influenced by the emotional power of visual images , whose instant , worldwide transmission has been made possible by rapid-fire advances in everything from satellite technology to personal computers .  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
Nile basin : Through the effective development of an operational remote sensing capacity to receive Meteosat satellite imagery for the Blue and White Nile data , Meteosat derived rainfall information is calibrated and fed into forecasting models to provide up to three weeks ' advance notice of river flow at critical points along the Blue Nile ;  
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
SAC-B is an Argentine-American satellite designed to advance the study of solar physics and astrophysics through the examination of solar flares , gamma ray bursts , diffuse X-ray cosmic background , and energetic neutral atoms .  SAC-B , a 181-kg . spacecraft , will be launched into orbit by a Pegasus-XL rocket .  
The new ARIANE-5 launcher has a dual purpose : first , to make the ARIANE family more competitive by enhancing performance levels , reducing launch costs , improving reliability and increasing the useful diameter under the fairing , so that ARIANE-5 will be capable of launching into geostationary transfer orbit either two-3,000 kilogram satellites simultaneously or a single satellite of up to 6,800 kilograms ; second , to satisfy Europe 's need for a low-orbit facility using manned vehicles or space station sections .  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Fixed satellite communications had given noticeable support to the growth of global , regional , national and local networks for government institutions and private enterprises in their daily operations .  
With the successful design , development , launch and in-orbit performance of the first generation of the Indian remote sensing satellite ( IRS ) , India was surging ahead to provide improved and enhanced data services from the second generation remote sensing satellites , IRS-1C and IRS-1D . IRS-1C , which was launched on 6 December 1995 , was characterized by an improved spatial resolution , extended spectral bands , stereo viewing and faster revisit capability .  
The tools available are assessment based on analysis of existing reliable country information ( already applied for the developing countries ) , sampling of high resolution satellite data ( already applied for tropical countries ) , organization of existing reliable information using GIS ( already applied for developing countries ) , questionnaires supported by a network of country correspondents ( applied in industrialized countries ) , and special studies undertaken by consultants or cooperating partners .  
The limited mass , volume , stability and optics of microsatellites could not compete with traditional large-scale missions such as the Land Remote Sensing Satellite ( LANDSAT ) , Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) and the European remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) ; however , for medium resolution and meteorological-scale imaging , the KITSAT and POSAT satellites had demonstrated a comparable facility but at a tiny fraction of the cost .  
Today , the infrastructure in remote and rural areas can be significantly improved through satellite remote sensing , particularly with respect to natural disaster warning and mitigation , management of water , forest and food resources , planning and operation of transport systems and other supporting activities relating to social and economic development .  
Among other issues , the use of modern satellite telecommunications technology for supporting a range of services such as telephone , distance education and health-care services and the attendant improvement in the quality of life in remote and rural areas was demonstrated .  
Following the decision of the Committee to promote international cooperation in space science and technology , the United Nations Programme on Space Applications was established with the objective , inter alia , of providing scientists from developing countries with educational programmes in remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite communication and basic space science .  
The presentations at the Workshop covered remote sensing , satellite communications and broadcasting in combination with electronic networking , satellite meteorology , satellite positioning systems and how they could be used , separately or in combination , to prevent , warn , monitor and mitigate the effects of disasters such as flooding , drought , landslides , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , fires , environmental degradation and regional and global phenomena such as El Ni �� .  
The Workshop recommended that civil defence institutions of the region , in collaboration with outside entities , should develop mechanisms based on existing infrastructures that incorporate the use of satellite communications , remote sensing , global positioning and other space technologies for the prevention , early warning and mitigation of the effects of disasters .  
He also noted that the Secretariat , as requested by the Subcommittee at its previous session in 1996 , had submitted a working paper entitled An analysis of the compatibility of the approach contained in the working paper entitled Some considerations concerning the utilization of the geostationary satellite orbit with the existing regulatory procedures of the International Telecommunication Union relating to the use of the geostationary orbit ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 205 ) .  
The Working Group was informed that the fifth preambular paragraph recalled the fact that the a priori allocation plans adopted by the ITU administrative radio conferences guaranteed equitable access to the geostationary satellite orbit and the radio frequencies for direct broadcasting satellite and fixed satellite services . 
The view was expressed that reference to practical problems in the implementation of equitable access to the geostationary satellite orbit presupposed that there were no prior legal problems in the implementation of equitable access , particularly for the developing countries .  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
There is an increased use in the region of satellite imagery and global positioning systems ( GPS ) ; geodetic networks are being improved ; and there is a continuing need to maintain topographic and thematic mapping and a priority need to produce data and maps in support of cadastre .  
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth , and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
To reinforce understanding of the principles of image interpretation , participants were divided on a regional basis into groups , each of which studied a case history where visual interpretation of satellite images played a key role .  
Technologies associated with space-based and terrestrial remote sensing , geographic information systems , satellite observation and communications , mathematical modelling of event scenarios , and the entire field of global communications have revolutionized the ability to monitor , analyze and disseminate accurate and timely information about natural hazards .  
While developing countries did not constitute a viable market for most of the large-scale satellite communication projects , they benefited from lucrative markets in the industrialized countries that lured international commercial programmes , and might be able to take advantage of the excess capacity of those programmes to satisfy their own communication needs .  
A wide range of applications were planned through those services , including distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work-groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , wireless backbone interconnection ( that is , wireless Local Area Network-Wide Area Network ) , video distribution , DTH video and satellite newsgathering , as well as the distribution of software , music , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
The system would complement the existing spatial high-resolution capabilities of the SPOT satellite series , providing simultaneous spectral measurements in the visible and short-wave infrared domain of the electromagnetic spectrum .  
The United Nations Statistics Division has been very active in the development of satellite accounts , and proposed a system for integrated environment and economic accounting ( SEEA ) , which was published in 1993.6 Several industrialized and developing countries are presently experimenting with the implementation of satellite accounts through the general application of the SEEA framework to a specific national context ( see box 6 ) . 
The major activities included the completion of a full environmental test campaign ( thermal vacuum , vibration , RF , and mass properties measurements ) on the Canadian MSAT M1 satellite ( successfully launched on 20 April 1996 ) , and the initiation of environmental testing on the various components ( motor modules , joints , latching end effectors , and the mobile base system ) for Canada 's contribution to the international Space Station Project , the Mobile Servicing System .  
It also runs specific projects related to : the use of infrared imagery for public agencies , academic and other research institutions ; thermal loss in urban areas ; and the use of NOAA satellite images for the operational definition of cloud systems .  
In satellite agrometeorology , work is continuing to provide a prompt service to users at different hierarchical levels , furnishing information on the condition of agricultural sown crops which is obtained by processing and interpreting data received from meteorological satellites .  
The technology involved in the processing and interpretation of digital satellite information and data obtained on the ground for the purposes of evaluation of crop condition and yield \ x { e8ca } echnology which is applied in an experimental operational system ( in a real-time regime ) \ x { e8c3 } akes it possible during the vegetation growing period to make a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the state of crops in 25 regions of the Russian Federation .  
In the view of one State , because of the successive flights of the United States Space Shuttle through the airspace of many third States , these could be considered as precedents of innocent passage , and since no opposition or objection had been raised , an international customary-law right had thus been created by such passage , analogous to the case of the first artificial Earth satellite .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
In the course of the discussion , delegations reviewed national and international cooperative programmes in satellite communications , including progress in communications satellite technology that would make satellite communications more accessible and less expensive and would increase the communications capacity of the geostationary orbit and the electromagnetic spectrum .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
The approach represents the satellite as a combination of individual elements and positions these to provide maximum protection to the satellite components .  [ 29 ] The PLATFORM model uses a novel element termed SHIELD [ 30 ] which uses genetic algorithms to determine the optimal configuration of a spacecraft based on the encountered environment and design constraints such as thermal and mass balancing .  
This is also necessary for an optimal combination with emerging satellite systems , which are complementary to terrestrial systems and fundamental for the rapid global expansion of services .  
The first series of SCD satellites manufactured in Brazil , designed for environmental data collection , had proved a success , the development of the necessary technologies for the Brazilian satellite launching vehicle had been completed , progress had also been made in the implementation of the joint Chinese-Brazilian project on the remote sensing of earth resources , and a cooperation agreement had been concluded with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .  
While saluting the efforts of the document 's authors , his delegation considered that it might be possible to make a less rigorous procedure for access to the geostationary orbit available solely to systems intended exclusively to serve the territory of a specific developing country and not to provide an international link , but not to the so-called " paper " satellite systems . 
In comparison with the satellite systems previously deployed in the mission area which are based on a single-channel portable satellite terminal and not capable of simultaneous transmissions , the very small aperture terminal ( VSAT ) earth stations are required to enhance MONUA communications infrastructure by providing the capability for permanent and simultaneous voice , facsimile and data transmission .  
Weather forecasts based on numerical weather prediction utilize , among other things , operational satellite measurements of both surface and upper air winds and atmospheric temperature fields ;  
Another area of greatest need is the development of small satellite technology , which has strong potential for offering a larger number of countries affordable access to space through the rapid development of fully integrated national space programmes .  
France is making a contribution to the Odin scientific satellite developed by Sweden and intended for the observation of the as yet unstudied electromagnetic spectral bands situated in the neighbourhood of wavelengths between 0.5 and 3 mm .  
The most dramatic and economically successful application of space technology , the communication satellite , has been the greatest boon to national , regional and global economic and social development .  
There is an increasing trend of more joint satellite missions , both on a national basis ( e.g . by merging military and civilian systems ) and through international cooperation .  
With rising worldwide demand for mobile satellite services , especially in developing countries , which often lack an adequate terrestrial telephone line infrastructure , planned LEO and MEO systems will supplement GEO satellite communications services .  
While the current personal mobile satellite communication systems were designed to provide data rates sufficient for messaging services and voice data , future systems were designed to support broadband applications .  
In the later case , a central , larger hub station connected via the space segment to the various remote sites , which were equipped with small , simple and relatively cheap satellite antennas .  
The broad base of users was one reason why satellite communications had developed into a strong market , while the remote sensing data market was still in a somewhat developmental stage , although slowly growing .  
To reinforce the understanding of the principles of image interpretation , participants were divided into groups on a regional basis ; each group studied a case where visual interpretation of satellite images played a key role .  
Provision of technical advisory services to Member States , as well as international and regional governmental and non-governmental organizations on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science , satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in these fields , upon request ( 8 to 10 per year ) .  
Daily and weekly dissemination on tape , via satellite and / or shortwave broadcasting , telephone feeds and as sound files on the Internet to participating radio organizations in all regions of the world for local , national , regional and international broadcasting ( News and Media Division ) ; ii .  
Priority is being given , therefore , to establishing links with radio stations worldwide , which will enable instantaneous use of the Departments radio programmes , through the most effective delivery system available in each region or subregion , including short wave , satellite , digital audio , telephone feeds , electronic audio-file transfer and other Internet-based mechanisms .  
With the rapid accumulation of satellite technology and the resulting expansion in Koreas space programme , a wide range of international cooperative activities are being implemented by the Republic of Korea and other countries at the regional and global levels .  
One of the most important challenges being tackled by Ukrainian specialists is to study the seas surface , atmospheric and oceanic dynamics , and marine temperatures and colours by means of satellite data , such research constituting a basic component of environmental monitoring and surveillance of navigational hazards .  
The new INTERSPUTNIK satellite fleet will provide for digital television channels , videoconferencing , cellular television broadcasting , interactive services , multimedia , high-bit rate access to the Internet , expansion of very small aperture terminal ( VSAT ) Earth station networks , tele-medicine and tele-education , banking services and reliable communications on a global basis .  
This is one of the most rapidly progressing and developing national sectors and signifies a major extension of satellite communication coverage , providing communities with a greater range of local telephone and radio services , which have been used , for example , for communications to and from regions hit by natural disasters , with a consequent improvement in the utilization of the resources assigned to disaster management .  
The focus of the programme is on areas related to satellite communications : satellite remote sensing for natural resources and environmental survey ; development of facilities for designing , assembly / fabrication and launching of communication satellites in geostationary orbit and light-weight satellites in near-Earth orbit for various scientific and applications purposes ; and study of natural and physical phenomena in the upper atmosphere and space through rocket launchings and other means .  
This programme aims at defining , developing and implementing a dedicated operational end-to-end satellite remote sensing capacity to provide real-time access to appropriate spatial data for supporting sustainable forest management at the subnational level .  
In order to prepare the country technologically for the expected information explosion of the twenty-first century , South Africa will align its regulatory framework to make use of all the technological advantages offered by wireless local loop and by fixed and mobile satellite services .  
The Working Group on Global Navigation Satellite Systems concluded that satellite navigation systems should be fully interoperable and transparent to the user and as a consequence recommended that the United States of America and the European Union ( EU ) develop a common definition of global navigation satellite systems ( GNSS ) for civil and public safety services .  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite - and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
Some representatives pointed out that industry in industrialized countries continued to play an active role in developing both new and innovative space applications and technology geared for markets in services in satellite communications , remote sensing and space transportation .  
Recognizing the importance of space science and space applications for the fundamental knowledge of the universe , education , health , environmental monitoring , management of natural resources , disaster management , meteorological forecasting and climate modelling , satellite navigation and communications , and the major contribution that space science and technology make to the well-being of humanity and specifically to economic , social and cultural development ,  
To implement an integrated , global system , especially through international cooperation , to manage natural disaster mitigation , relief and prevention efforts , especially of an international nature , through Earth observation , communications and other space-based services , making maximum use of existing capabilities and filling gaps in worldwide satellite coverage ;  
Wide-ranging applications being planned include distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , electronic commerce , direct-to-home video and satellite news-gathering , as well as the distribution of music , software , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
Owing to the location of the Tribunal headquarters , an effective and safe communications infrastructure is essential for the Tribunal staff at different locations : pouch services ; an enhanced satellite communications service including the Internet ; additional telephone / fax lines to distribute incoming documents on urgent and confidential matters more quickly and safely ; and for connecting an additional number of off-site locations to the central system . 
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; remote sensing for land use planning and environmental monitoring ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
To reinforce their understanding of the principles of image interpretation , participants were divided into groups on a regional basis ; each group studied a case where visual interpretation of satellite images played a key role .  
The main suggestions and recommendations made were as follows : ( a ) the digital image processing and GIS parts of the programme should be expanded ; ( b ) additional training in advanced technologies and microwave remote sensing would be useful in order to enable participants to improve educational curricula in their respective institutions ; and ( c ) access to satellite images and teaching materials should be improved .  
They include activities such as environmental planning , use of the geographical information system ( GIS ) , the global positioning system ( GPS ) and satellite images in environmental assessment and monitoring , demarcation of protected areas , guided firewood harvesting , promotion of energy-efficient cooking devices and practices , erosion control , tree planting , agroforestry , and environmental education and awareness raising .  
It includes purchase of one digital satellite ( hot standby ) terminal , one Optaphone digitally controlled rural telephone link system , four global positioning systems and the replacement of 30 base mobile transceivers .  
The digital satellite ( hot standby ) terminal is needed to replace the existing main analog terrestrial microwave link on Mount Olympus , which is an obsolete model for which maintenance is not cost-effective , and to extend the field assets control system , installed at UNFICYP headquarters in 1997 , to the three Sectors .  
The development of more cost-effective mapping procedures based on satellite data will surely result in increased use of remote sensing data and consequently expand the market for such data , enabling developing countries to collect and update basic information on the topographic and thematic ( natural resource ) cartography of their territories .  
Formal technical presentations during the first of the three sessions focused on the role of remote sensing in achieving national food security , mapping from space , agricultural applications of small satellites , as well as recent trends in remote sensing and meteorological and global navigation satellite systems .  
Tectonic and environmental hazard mapping of the northern segment of the Dead Sea fault system using a digital elevation model ( DEM ) from ESA remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) tandem mission synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) data ( international ) ;  
The regional offices will be linked up by satellite and extended to districts by terrestrial radio , telephone and microwave links that will provide reliable and transparent connectivity .  
To reinforce understanding of the principles of image interpretation , participants were divided into groups on a regional basis ; each group studied a case where visual interpretation of satellite images played a key role .  
Warnings of bad weather and natural disasters to remote areas and ships : satellite telecommunications offer increased reliability compared to the standard terrestrial maritime communications facilities that were used in the past ;  
The Committee agreed that activities involving international cooperation , such as participation in international scientific campaigns , sharing of satellite data , providing educational and training assistance to other countries and building institutional capacity , should be further encouraged to enable outer space to be explored and used for peaceful purposes .  
The view was expressed that , while discussing barriers to the greater use of space applications and services within the United Nations system under the second year of the work plan , in 2002 , difficulties experienced by the satellite data user community , such as the exorbitant cost of data , lack of technical know-how and of equipment to process the data and use the products thereof and inappropriate spatial resolution , should be considered in detail by the Subcommittee in order to find reasonable solutions to those problems .  
The participants in the regional workshops have included : representatives of institutions involved in disaster reduction , civil protection and emergency response activities ; representatives of international and regional organizations involved in supporting disaster management ; representatives of space agencies with activities related to disaster management ; and experts in remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite communications and positioning via satellites .  
The worldwide network of institutions collaborating through the workshops in the past decade has been supporting : ( a ) ground-based networks of small optical and radio telescopes and associated research and education programmes ; and ( b ) a new concept for a multinational space-based astronomical satellite mission ( World Space Observatory ) , particularly for the benefit of developing countries .  
Recommendations emanating from the Workshop are expected to focus on future needs for the regulation of space traffic , Earth-threatening asteroids and comets , global navigation satellite systems , space and the public and on the contribution of space systems to the implementation and verification of international environmental agreements .  
The European Union participated actively in space activities and carried out a variety of scientific projects , including for the development of the automatic satellite navigation system " Galileo " and a global monitoring system for environmental protection and safety which would have practical applications in a broad range of fields , including the prevention of natural and man-made disasters and the mitigation of their effects .  
Many delegations called for increased international cooperation in financial and technology assistance in building capacity , education , training and raising public awareness , particularly in systematic observations of the Earths atmosphere and of the oceans and the land surface , including satellite data .  
That delegation also raised concerns regarding the possible transfer of access codes and control of space objects to creditors in cases of default , in particular in cases where the facilities of a single satellite were being shared by multiple users , including States , or where satellites served governmental and public service functions in addition to those of a purely commercial nature .  
That delegation also raised concerns regarding the possible transfer of access codes and control of space objects to creditors in cases of default , in particular in cases where the facilities of a single satellite were being shared by multiple users , including States , or where satellites served governmental and public service functions in addition to those of a purely commercial nature .  
Under the direct supervision of the Chief , GIS Cell ( GISC ) , the incumbent would be responsible for the overall operating , developing and implementing of the GIS-related matters in terms of logistics in peacekeeping operations ; provide geographic / terrain analysis using GIS technology , produce terrain studies and predict the effects of weather , terrain and logistics situations in peacekeeping operations , compile textual , graphic products from text , electronic format of geographic data ( vector , raster , satellite images ) and other sources of data .  
The purpose of the council was to develop a comprehensive national programme to take advantage of the peaceful applications of the use of outer space and to attain the technological and development objectives of the State , including the adoption of satellite technology for the study of desert regions , while training scientific personnel , developing an Egyptian space programme and using space technology and its applications in the development of local industry .  
Data received from the SAC-C satellite are used to study the terrestrial and marine environment , assess desertification , monitor flooding , forecast agricultural production , monitor the atmospheric temperature and vapour content of water with a view to determining the variability of the atmospheric structure , perform measurements of the geomagnetic field with the same level of accuracy attained by observatories , measure atmospheric space radiation and its effects on advanced electronic components , determine the migratory route of the southern right whale and verify methods used in determining satellite attitude and velocity .  
To build the capacity required to develop and extend its activities in different areas of the peaceful uses of space , including satellite communication , resource investigation and satellite-based positioning systems , satellite meteorology and natural disaster monitoring , space science and technology , the Islamic Republic of Iran is not only currently taking required measures to provide required facilities , hardware and software , but is also extending its educational activities both using national resources and through the implementation of bilateral regional or interregional cooperation projects .
