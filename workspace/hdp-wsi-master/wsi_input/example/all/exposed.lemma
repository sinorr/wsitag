The keynote of Chen Shui-bian 's inaugural speech is dissatisfactory and unacceptable to the mainland .

According to an authoritative personality in Beijing who is involved in Taiwan affairs , the meeting held that Chen Shui-bian lacked sincerity and deliberately evaded the one-China principle in the inaugural speech and that the sense of Taiwan independence exposed and the language used in the speech are disappointing and we should heighten our vigilance .  The keynote of Chen Shui-bian 's inaugural speech is dissatisfactory and unacceptable to the mainland .  
After Chen Shui-bian , who had been a member of the opposition party , was elected as Taiwan 's new leader , the outside generally doubted whether or not the armed forces , which had been controlled by the Kuomintang over a long time , would take orders from Chen Shui-bian , who previously was strongly opposed to interference in government work by the military , called for cutting military spending , and exposed the dark side of the military , and doubted whether or not the military would stage a coup d'tat .
