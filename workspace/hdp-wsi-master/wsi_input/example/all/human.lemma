Chinese scientists ' research on human genome has been fully supported by the State 's Program 869 and Program 973 , Natural Science Foundation and others .  On April 21 , the relevant person in charge at the State Natural Science Foundation said in an interview that opening the human gene database to the public free of charge can allow ordinary people access to the cutting-edge science .  The person in charge said the more the public get to know about the innovative science , the more motivated scientists will feel for research .  
Li Jing said that wetlands in the northwest not only account for a large proportion of China 's wetlands but were mainly located in sensitive areas like headwater areas , oases , riversides and inland lakes .  Under natural and human influences , they are not easily recoverable once damaged .  
Now the western region should firmly seize the good opportunity for massive development , formulate a preferential policy , improve working conditions , and step up its efforts to bring in and use qualified personnel ; not only should it fully develop and utilize its own human resources but it should be able to retain qualified personnel and use them creatively ; moreover , it should make positive efforts to attract a large number of qualified personnel from developed areas and even from abroad to work for the massive development of the western region .  
Seizing the opportunity for common development with the western region , the eastern region should formulate concrete measures to actively train and provide qualified personnel for the western region ; it should encourage local outstanding personnel to seek new development in the western region and practically assist the latter in solving problems of want of human resources , instability of the cadre ranks , and an irrational cadre structure and distribution so as to promote the economic and social development of the western region together .  
According to its own special features , Tunisia has selected development ways which are suitable to its national situation and has made noticeable achievements in safeguarding social stability , promoting the development of the economy , and improving the living conditions of the people ; thus Tunisia has done its best to safeguard human rights .  
Because of their narrow education values , lopsided views on quality , and outmoded notions on talent , the education department and parents tend to one-sidedly pursue enrollment quotas and overlook students ' psychological quality and moral character and their disciplinary and legal education , thus placing the value of course grades above human values and replacing the objective of education with the goal of human and social development .  
We urge the United States to observe the basic principles governing international relations , correct its erroneous doings , and stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries by using the so-called human rights issue .  
The two countries ' foreign ministers called for the unconditional respect for the right of the people of all countries to choose social systems , value concepts , and ways of development in line with their countries ' conditions .  They considered the interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries on humanitarian grounds and in the name of protecting human rights constitute acts that violate the purpose and principle of the United Nations Charter .  
As technological innovation is an important guarantee for enhancing competitiveness and achieving internationalization , Chinese household electrical appliance enterprises have not relaxed in technological innovation even for a moment after making it into the international market , investing massive human , material , and financial resources in technological innovation as well as marketizing , internationalizing , and commercializing it .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
The main reason why the United States produces an annual country report on human rights practices , heedless of the strong opposition of other countries , assumes the air of a " judge of human rights , " and insists on interfering in affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries is mainly to use this as a pretext for putting political pressure on other countries , especially developing and socialist countries , in a bid to change their political and social systems .  
Hegemonism is also manifest in the fact that the US annual Country Report on Human Rights Practices ignores the objective fact that human rights in China are improving all the time , and shows serious political bias in yet again attacking China at great length .  
The United States , mouthing human rights , in the end utilized concentrated bombing and depleted uranium bombs - - weapons prohibited by international law , and bombed residential sites , schools , hospital , and other civilian targets , even flagrantly bombing chemical installations , causing the spread of chemicals and reagents , seemingly carrying out chemical warfare .  
These countries stressed that the United States does not have the authority to criticize the human rights situation of other countries , and this kind of application of the domestic law of one nation to the legal system of other nations is not only no in accordance with international law , but is not helpful to realizing mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among nations .  
In other words , they attempt to bring developing countries to their strategic track and force developing countries to facilitate their hegemonist goal and to be their dependencies .  However , most developing countries have the bitter experience of being bullied and humiliated by Western big powers , thus they extremely treasure their national sovereignty and dignity and , of course , resolutely oppose and struggle against the so-called " human rights standard " and the " values " foisted on them by the current hegemonist powers .  
For example also , the overwhelming majority of China 's analysts held that the so-called " human rights being higher than sovereignty " is only a used by a hegemonist country to promote power politics .  The vast numbers of developing nations will not be able to achieve independent political and economic development and human rights in the modern sense if they depart from the framework of sovereignty and the protection of international law .  
Teachers are engineers of human souls ; improving teachers ' ideological and political qualities and ethics cultivation will be of decisive significance to the comprehensive ethical , intellectual , physical , and aesthetic development of children and youths and to training qualified personnel for modernization construction .  
Accession to the WTO will be a major step in our country 's economic development strategy in the 21st century .  With the inevitable enhancement of foreign exchanges , there will be more intensive exchanges and movements of human , material , information , and financial resources .  
Although Uganda , in the highlands of East Africa , is separated from China by thousands of miles , there are striking similarities between the activities of the " Movement for the Restoration of the 10 Commandments of God " and the " Falungong " cult that had caused mass unrest in China : They both made up stories , engaged in deification , spread heresy , hoodwinked the people , formed secret societies , swindled money and accumulated wealth by unfair means , persecuted good and innocent people , showed contempt for human rights . . .  
He noted that for decades , this movement has adhered to the aims and principles of independence , autonomy , non-alignment , and non-grouping , always devoting its efforts to defending the interests of the many developing countries , and actively promoting the establishment of a new just and rational international political and economic order , in an outstanding effort to promote peace and development for the human race .  
All countries should have the right to act in line with their native national conditions to choose their respective political systems and development models .  No nation or group of states has the right to force its values and social system onto others , even less so to exploit the human rights matter or a so-called " humanitarian crisis " as an excuse to deliberately interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country .  
makes information distorted and policy decisions wrong ; causes the waste of many human , material , and financial resources and precious time ; and enables the people to lose many rare chances for development .  
This yearbook mainly provided firsthand materials on China 's human rights history , theory , and reality .  It is research , material , and guidance oriented .  It gave a sweeping view of the 50 years of the history of the founding of new China . It dealt with many areas including theory , laws , policies , current situation , and foreign relations .  It is a yearbook that gives a comprehensive look into the development of human rights in new China .  
The publication of this yearbook filled a major void in China 's human rights theoretical building , provided authoritative materials for the international community to understand China 's views on human rights and China 's human rights reality , and provided effective objective facts and theories to refute international hostile forces ' distortion of and attack against China 's human rights conditions .  
At the same time , while protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups , the governments must respect the universal principle concerning human rights acknowledged by the international community and also have the right to adopt measures that commensurate with their own national conditions in the light of their own realities because historical background , cultural tradition , development level , and nationality composition vary from country to country .  
Cult leaders accumulated wealth unlawfully and in a big way , and organised their followers to besiege media units , schools , scientific research institutes critical of the sect , seriously disturbing the public order , infringing upon human rights , and endangering other people 's personal safety .  
The barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia by the US-led NATO forces over 78 days from March to June 1999 pushed hegemonism to a new level that is even more dangerous , threatening , and hypocritical .  That is , a new stage in which , in the name of preventing a humanitarian disaster , they have tied human rights diplomacy and military aggression even more tightly together , and a new stage in which hypocrisy and brutality are combined even more shamelessly .  
This kind of " international interference " can only be applicable within the commonwealth of sovereign states basically sharing similar political systems , legal standards , and value concepts and reaching a common view on human rights .  
During reform and opening up as well as during its modernization drives , China has attached importance to and advocated the all-round development of people .  It not only emphasizes the social and economic rights of the people but also vigorously develops and safeguards the political rights of citizens , strives for realizing the " all-round human rights , " which include political rights , economic rights , social rights , and cultural rights as well collective rights and individual rights .  
Liu Jing said : In the process of implementing the " declaration on the rights and obligations of individuals , groups , and social organizations in enhancing and protecting generally-acknowledged human rights and basic freedom , " which was passed in 1998 , it is natural to encounter various questions .  This is an inevitable fact .  The concern of the international community in this respect is understandable .  
The outgoing IMF managing director , Michel Camdessus , said : We have the opportunity to avoid financial crisis and narrow the wide gap between the rich and the poor that " may possibly cause an explosion " so that economic globalization will have human nature in a greater sense .  However , the premise for so doing is that the international economic structure must be commensurate with economic globalization and economic reform plans are widely supported by the populace .  
However , the United States ignored facts and again put forward an anti-China motion at the meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights to meet the needs of its domestic political and party struggle , in a vain attempt to make use of the so-called human rights issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs and vilify China 's international image .  
Such practice of using the human rights issue as a political tool to create ideological confrontation and promote hegemonism epitomizes politicization of the human rights issue , utterly violates the purpose and principles of the UN Charter and runs counter to the trend of the times , in which the international community calls for dialogue and cooperation .  It is only natural that the resolution was rejected by a majority of the members of the UN Human Rights Commission , and opposed by the just world opinion .  
and the United States is constantly mired in scandals of infringing upon human rights in other countries , and marked by numerous notorious records of its engagement in unjust military aggressions everywhere and disregarding the established principles of international law .  
If the US Government could be introspective regarding their failure , it would not be difficult to discover that the politicizing of human rights is wishful thinking , and has already caused a lot of countries in the world , especially developing countries , to be strongly disapproving .  And it is also an obstacle to all kinds of economic development by the United Nations . This affects dialogue and cooperation about human rights between all member countries .  
The overall concept and content of human rights are indivisible and unchangeable .  The firm stride of the Chinese people walking toward domestic prosperity is unstoppable .  
At the UN human rights meetings , the United States provoked confrontation and disputes on many occasions out of certain domestic political needs and also its stubborn mentality of " moral imperialism " and the so-called international strategy of national egoism .  
In the wake of the deepening of reforms and the development of socialist market economy , economic components and interests , social organizational forms and social ways of life , and jobs and employment methods are becoming more varied by the day , and this inevitably affects people 's ideological concepts and human relations in various ways , and some of these influences are negative ;  
We should apply Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory to enhance the ideological and political levels of the young cadres ; apply modern scientific knowledge and the fruits of outstanding human culture to enhance their professional standards ; apply the practice of arduous and complex environment and a variety of posts to temper and enhance their leadership ability ;  
Wei Ziqing ( researcher and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering ) : The use of satellite navigation is extremely widespread , from outer space to the land and sea , and from military and economic activities to our human and social lives , it reaches every trade and industry , e.g . , space navigation , determining satellite orbits , space surveys and mapping , weapons guidance , traffic and transportation , agriculture , forestry , and mining , geodetic surveys , and rescue and disaster relief , etc . 
We have taken the complementary paths of pre-study and modeling , import and self-development , scientific research and production , military products and civil products , and scientific and technological development and nurturing of human talent for scientific research units being brought into the marketplace in order to implement high starting points for development and a name brand strategy and advance into the " open " market seeking new points for profit increase .  
Only Marxism discovered for the first time the law of development of human society , namely existence decides consciousness , material production decides spiritual production , economic foundation decides super structure , the relations between productive force and production and the contradictions between economic foundation and superstructure push social progress .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
Fujian has promulgated and put into effect the " Fujian Management Regulations for Coastal Shipping , Border Defense , and Public Security " , setting up a " top official " leadership responsibility system for fighting illegal emigration , for a harsh crackdown by law on snake-heads and human smugglers .  And it has set up an exclusive snake-head crackdown taskforce , engaging in " online snake-head arrests " , all of which steps show Fujian 's firm stand and resolve against illegal emigration .  
The reality of changing the use of violence from unlimited to controllable realistically indicates that along with the ceaseless improvement in the civilization degree of human society , the miserable way of wars that were applied in the past has been changed .  
In future international competitions , able personnel and the quality of man will become two decisive factors , and whoever can successfully seize the commanding heights in the field of able personnel and can hold in possession rich human sources will be able to gain the upper hand in competition .  
among the objective environment and major theories and problems of implementation which affect people 's ideological activities , one is the actual situation where the lightning increase in the total quantity of human knowledge and the rapid breakthroughs in modern technology of the " knowledge economy " which has the entire world as its scope have already shown themselves .  
This regiment was equipped with certain advanced anti-tank self-propelled guns and anti-tank missiles , but some battalions and companies failed to concentrate their main energies on the development and application of the property of the new equipment and the mastery of weapons in hand .  Instead , they put a lot of financial , material and human resources into learning English and microcomputer technology , and making multi-media software .  All battalions and companies of this regiment reported more than 30 science-technology military training achievements to the regiment in a year .  
" It is difficult to draw a human being but it is easy to draw a ghost " .  This is how the Chinese describe tricks aimed at deceiving people with fabricated stories , meaning that it is difficult to deceive people with what is real or can be seen but easy to lead people astray with what is absurd or preposterous .  
For the various policies that the United States has adopted for the implementation of its national strategy , one distinct feature is that differences in ideologies and values are being used to serve specific strategic purposes ; and as it has turned out , the United States is practicing a double standard when evaluating human rights and social values .  
The US strategy of human rights and values that we are talking about here is not simply a " soft " power , because it actually interacts with the strong superiority of the United States in the scientific and technological as well as economic fields , and also interacts with the active military presence of the United States in regions concerned .  
We must clearly perceive the political conspiracy and sinister ambition of western hostile forces on the human rights issue , always remain politically sober and staunch , and shoulder our mission of protecting the nation 's security and unity .  
Internationally speaking , the trend of multi-polarization keeps developing , and the world situation generally tends to relax .  However , the world is not peaceful , as the superpower is still pursuing hegemonism , propagating such absurd views as " human rights overriding sovereignty " and " legitimate humanitarian intervention " , or even resorting to armed aggression and expansion .  
Human society 's change from the pastoral civilization to agricultural civilization and from agricultural civilization to industrial civilization was the qualitative leap of the human social and economic development after the structural adjustments were repeatedly accumulated to a certain stage .  
In addition to continuously taking readers ' requirements into first consideration and regarding scientific ways of health preservation and health care as main contents , this section will add some relevant new columns , such as self-treatment of diseases , miraculous ways for long life , origins of human relations , Doctor Feng 's mailbox , weekly medicated food , the quickest way for improving one 's looks , psychology hotlines , and new medical findings .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
The 20th century saw a series of major events that affected the course of the world history , but what had the greatest impact on the changes in human society and induced the most profound speculations is the transformation of the socialist ideal into practice , from practice into system , from the practice of a single country into the practice of numerous countries , and again from a triumphant march into a tortuous journey .  
With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
Socialism has opened up the way to the solution of the contradiction between the productive forces and relations of production inherent in capitalism , and , while liberating the productive forces of socialist countries to the utmost extent , at the same time objectively promoted the improvement of capitalist system .  Capitalism 's internal contradictions got somewhat smoothed out , and capitalism was given a new opportunity for development ; this , in its turn advanced socialist production and the development and progress of human civilization as a whole .  
As everyone knows , the Kosovo war was a war of aggression in which the United States mustered the NATO states to intervene in barbaric fashion in the internal affairs of a small and weak country while waving the banner of " human rights transcend sovereignty , " heedless of the UN charter and the accepted norms of international relations , and without UN authorization .  
Pilotless combat planes can complete various missions without the limitations set by the human body , such as approaching close to forward positions , carrying ground tracking sensors , synthetic aperture radar sensors , moving target indicators , and so on , or else doing on-the-spot monitoring of chemical and biological substances .  
One of the important issues in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to correctly deal with the influence of the international environment and the international political struggle on people 's thoughts in the course of persistently carrying out reforms , opening up , and increasing economic and cultural exchanges with the outside world , while actively absorbing and learning from all the good results achieved by human society as a whole in civilization development , and effectively resist the corrosive influence of the decadent ideologies and cultures from the West .  
This tragic incident has further exposed the antihuman , antisocial , and antiscientific essence of the " Falungong " cult and pierced through the sham features of Li Hongzhi and western anti-China forces in preaching that permitting the practice of " Falungong " means " upholding human rights " .  
Their twisted and fallacious theories create great psychological pressure on many people , not only driving their followers to the path of death , making their wives and children walk out on them , breaking up the families , and ruining lives , but also seriously undermining public order , violating the law and normal moral standards , infringing on basic human rights and freedom , and lead to anti-humanity , anti-social , and anti-science crimes .  
Western countries headed by the United States always draw an ideological line by only recognizing western value standards and human rights concepts , and they want every country to completely copy their ways , irrespective of their historical traditions and level of social and economic development .  This has already caused social turmoil and even war in certain African countries .  
In order to deceive people , he disguised himself as a religious leader who had suffered persecution , and accused the Chinese Government of violating human rights .  He took credit and sought rewards from his master in the West by acting against the Chinese Government . He openly served as a shameful tool and a pawn of anti-China forces in the West in an attempt to play a role in helping anti-China forces in the West promote " Westernization " in China and " split " China .  
They practiced a double standard on the issue of handling heretical cults .  In its own country , the US has adopted resolute measures to deal with heretic cult organizations such as the " Planet " and " Branch Davidians " heretic cults .  However , in the name of " safeguarding human rights , " it has made a fuss about China 's legal activities to outlaw the heretic cult of " Falungong , " and this will gradually become an integral part of its China strategy .  
The successful development of 6,000-meter underwater robots has helped surmounted the barriers the ocean has set for human beings .  As a result , China has mastered the important weaponry to advance toward the deep sea , and become one of the few countries equipped with this technique .  
The ratification of the " convention " has been declared publicly to the international community that China is exerting efforts to develop human rights undertakings in accordance with national conditions , and is resolute and confident in guaranteeing that all citizens can enjoy all kinds of human rights and basic freedom .  This act will further enhance China 's prestige in the international arena and better foster China 's good image of democracy , civilization , and respecting human rights in the international arena .  
Since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have attached prime importance to people 's right of existence in accordance with China 's national conditions , succeeded in realizing two historical leaps - - moving from poverty to having enough food and clothing and then to leading a comparatively comfortable life , and achieved comprehensive economic and social development .  World-shaking changes have taken place in China 's human rights situation , and China has been generally praised by the international community for these changes .  
The obsessive " Falungong " followers who set themselves ablaze at Tiananmen Square on Chinese New Year 's eve perpetrated a self-immolation incident that shook the whole world because they had long been poisoned by the evil fallacies of Li Hongzhi . They had lost their sense of reasoning as normal human beings when they turned their backs on their loved ones , their family , their school and the normal society .  
The " Covenant " actually confirms such basic human rights as the right of survival and the right of development .  It points out : Only after the creation of the economic , social , and cultural rights that can be enjoyed by all people , as the creation of the same conditions for civil and political rights available to all people , will the ideal freedom which frees mankind from terror and shortage be realized .  
These Interim Procedures have replaced the non-selection resettlement model based on assignment with a model that combines assignment with self-assignment .  This model will help make full use of the expertise of retired cadres and help these cadres obtain their desired goal .  This model also provides a legal guarantee the reasonable distribution of high-quality professional human resources .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
As a rule , such U.S . official " human rights reports " flagrantly criticize the human rights situations in other countries .  They cite hearsay of one kind or another , but can not present any valid evidence .  Because of this , the reports have been regarded by international public opinion as a combination of " misinformation , exaggerations , groundless accusations , and lopsided and arbitrary conclusions " .  
In recent years , as China has developed into a stronger China with continually enhanced international status , which the United States does not like to see , while strategically maintaining ties and economically occupying the China market , the United States has stubbornly played the human rights card , sowed discord between the masses and the government , and frequently caused trouble , interfering in , blocking , and sabotaging the cause of the Chinese people in following the road they have chosen and continually developing and growing stronger .  
Sixth , vigorously implement the strategy of invigorating Tibet through science and education , give priority to the development of education , exploit and make good use of human and S &amp; T resources within and without Tibet and shift economic and social development to the track of reliance on scientific and technological advances and improved quality of laborers .  
To always represent the way forward for advanced culture is to persist in developing what is useful and discarding what is not , correctly handle the relationship between inheriting the national traditional culture and blazing new trails , and strengthen cultural exchanges between fraternal nationalities so as to absorb all fruits of civilization of the human society .  
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
This is so because , first , radical and emotional nationalism directly appeals to " first principles of survival " and attacks all dissenting voices as threats to national survival ; in this way , it attempts to exclusively occupy intellectual and public opinion commanding heights , so as to become the dominant speech prevailing over all other human values and the virtual " supreme command . "  
President Jiang Zemin pointed out not long ago : After China participates in the " International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , " China will subject itself to the United Nations ' supervision , will conscientiously fulfill the state obligations specified by the " Covenant , " will effectively promote the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights for the Chinese citizens by legislative , administrative , and other means , and will thus make contributions to the human rights cause in the world .  
The delegation also held special report sessions on " opposing evil cult , guaranteeing human rights " for Chinese students studying in France and for overseas Chinese living and working in France . During its visit , the delegation also met with leaders of the French official and non-governmental anti-cult organizations and leaders of the French religious circles .  Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
At the current human rights meeting , the United States once again groundlessly attacked China , set forth an anti-China motion , and provoked confrontation .  To retort , Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai pointed out in all seriousness that the United States was keen to dish out human rights motions against other countries , wantonly attacked other countries ' political systems by flaunting the banner of " safeguarding human rights , " tried hard to turn human rights issues into political issues for achieving its political purpose of exerting pressure onto other countries .  
" Falungong " stirred up an immolation incident , and has harmed human lives , impaired " Falungong " practitioners ' physical and mental health , assembled people to make troubles , disrupted social order , and undermined national security - - all these are characteristics common to sects .  
Professor Yu frankly admitted that as a developing country with a population of 1.2-billion , China 's per capita natural resources are comparatively scant , its current economic and cultural development is imbalanced , its legal system is not complete , and , in the process of law enforcement , some laws are not strictly abided by and some laws are not strictly enforced - - all these contribute to the non-perfect human rights situation in China .  
Zhang Xiaoling , a professor at the Central Party School who has been devoted to the specialized study of " women and human rights , " further expounded that according to the International Human Rights Charter , human rights can be classified into two categories - - civil and political rights and economic , social , and cultural rights .  
Take its handling of the Tibet question for example , after taking office in 1993 , former US President Bill Clinton again highlighted the values of human rights by following in Jimmy Carter 's footsteps .  Clinton declared : If China refuses to make improvement on human rights , the United States will not grant MFN status to China . Clinton also listed protecting Tibet 's unique religious or cultural heritage in his wish list on human rights and even arranged an unscheduled meeting between himself and Dalai in the White House .  
Though quite a few US congressmen , including both senators and representatives , had expressed strong opposition to delinking the Chinese communists ' improvement on human rights with the MFN status , the US Congress eventually gave in to its self-advertised psychological tactic of economic liberalization and decided to normalize trade relations with China , and this deprived the United States of a strong bargaining counter with regard to sanctions against China over the issue of human rights .  
On the one hand , we make constant efforts to perfect human rights in China , and on the other hand , we continue to engage in dialogue with foreign friends .  Only when dialogue proceeds from a level playing field , can we advance mutual understanding and promote mutual exchange and cooperation .  
Cai added : Over the past few years , neo-interventionism centered on such theories as " human rights overriding sovereignty , " " sovereignty being limited , " and others have caused a great clamor , and certain countries have adopted a double standard on the issue of human rights and have interfered in other countries ' internal affairs on the pretext of humanitarianism , and this has posed a new threat to the world peace and security .  
The editorial says : The current incident of bumping aircraft was caused by the US side single-handedly based on human testimony and material evidence .  However , the US side made unfounded countercharges after the incident , unreasonably criticized the Chinese side , and even used international law to evade its responsibility .  
The editorial says : The United States claims to be a country being most respectful to democracy and legal system in the world and always talks about human rights and law .  However , its military plane wantonly violated international law and paid no attention to the territories and sovereignty of another country .  
In 2000 , the Ninth Five-Year for National Economic and Social Development was successfully completed , the development of the western region got off to a good start , and the economy developed in a healthy way .  During that year , China 's democratic and legal systems were continuously strengthened , and its human rights situation maintained a good momentum of development .  
In light of China 's national conditions and according to the people 's wishes , the Chinese government aims to build a democratic and modernized country with a high level of civilization under the rule of law , and actively learn from the beneficial experiences and cultural achievements of other countries .  While maintaining social stability , it also aims to expedite development , strengthen the democratic legal system , promote spiritual civilization , and continuously push forward the development of the human rights cause .  
All these activities provide rich basic materials for the research of human rights theories , expand the scope of human right theoretical research in China , and have filled up some gaps in the research of human rights in China , enhanced the level of human rights theoretical research , and also provided a benign social environment for the development of human rights theoretical research in China .  
Wang Faqiang , vice president of the Armed Police General Hospital , who has personally saved the lives of over 1,300 patients in all kinds of critical conditions , said that as medical workers , duty-bound to heal the wounded and rescue the dying , I and my colleagues are deeply aware that human beings are the most precious .  
She pointed out that the achievements gained in the customs ' scientific and technological work are the results of the exploration and innovation made by the vast number of customs ' scientific and technological personnel as well as their selfless dedication .  The advanced customs scientific and technological collectives and individuals who were commended today are the outstanding representatives of the contingent of scientists and technicians .  They are the invaluable human resources of the customs sector and deserve the commendation and handsome rewards .  
China has cracked down on " Falungong " according to the law , exposed Li Hongzhi 's deception , cut off the murdering paws of the cults , made most " Falungong " practitioners see through the true nature of the cult and enabled them to return to normal life , rescued those fanatic practitioners who fell into the trap set up by the cult , and helped avoid the occurrence of human tragedy .  
Today , at a special meeting on training and promoting female cadres and recruiting female party members held by the CPC Central Organization Department , Zeng Qinghong , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee , member of the CPC Central Secretariat , and director of the CPC Central Organization Department , stressed that women are " half the sky " in human society and Chinese women form an important force in our country 's socialist modernization drive .  
Once people practice Falungong , they would place themselves under the control of the cult 's tightly knitted organization and its cruel spiritual shackles .  Gradually the practitioners would become depressed and apathetic , with no sense of responsibility toward society and family .  After losing their basic human nature , obsessed Falungong practitioners could become extraordinarily cruel and violent and could do incredible things .  
The citizens of Cincinnati were extremely angry after this incident of acting with total disregard for human life occurred , and protest demonstrations developed into violent citywide racial clashes .  
Zhu Feng : The Chinese government has all along assigned importance to and treasured the stability and constructive development of Sino-US relations .  Sustained intervention by the United States on China 's human rights condition in this process has hurt the friendly feelings of the Chinese people .  It has also widened the scope of disputes between the two countries and artificially complicated and sharpened bilateral relations .  
Touching on the prospects for the development of bilateral relations , Hu Jintao said that friendly relations between China and Vietnam constitute a valuable asset of the two parties and two peoples .  Strengthened cooperation between the two parties and two nations is not only beneficial to the building of socialism in Vietnam and China and to economic prosperity and social progress in the two countries but also conducive to promoting peace and human progress in Asia and the world .  
Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .  
He pointed out : Every time the anti-China motion is raised , the United States makes the same argument that the human rights situation in China has been deteriorating , and such an argument is in total disregard of China 's great achievements in developing its economy and promoting social progress and the fact that the Chinese people are enjoying civil and political rights to an unprecedented degree in terms of both scope and depth in these years .  
The Pakistani people are so full of wisdom .  His humorous words laid bare the fact that the United States keeps using its " 301 Article " against developing countries and tries to link the human rights issue to China 's permanent normal trade position .  Even the US representative could not help but force a wry and embarrassed smile .  
Since these training exercises , be they staged on a map , on a computer in a simulated manner , or with real arms and real men , often involve a large amount of financial and human resources and organizational efforts , we should study ways of fully developing their exemplary or guiding roles for our teaching and training work ;  
Wu Yi pointed out : Cities are situated in a central position in economic and social development , and play a strong influential and leading role in their peripheral areas .  It is necessary to do creative work in accordance with the actual conditions , give full play to their advantages in science , technology , education , and human resources , and more quickly advance the implementation of the strategy of promoting trade with science and technology .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that China and Syria are both developing countries ; the Chinese Government values its traditional friendship with Syria and appreciates and thanks the Syrian Government for its enduring valuable support for China on the Taiwan and human rights issues ; it is ready to continue to maintain and strengthen coordination and cooperation with Syria in all fields in the new century , and raise to a new level the enduringly stable bilateral relationship of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation .  
In conducting education and training of middle-aged and young cadres , we must pay close attention mainly to two things : One is that we must help them master the basic tenets of Marxism , get a clear understanding of the objective laws governing the development of human society , and buttress confidence in taking the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics , and guide them to emancipate the mind , use their brains , conduct new explorations in the light of new realities , and promote innovations and development in Marxist theory .  
Wang Zhongyu said : In the work of training and attracting talented , skilled , and qualified people , efforts should be focused on meeting the urgent human resources needs at the higher levels , thus enhancing the overall level of human resources in our country , enhancing our international competition power , and providing human resources guarantee for developing science , technology , and productivity by leaps and bounds .  
The attempted bloody self-immolation incident plotted by the Dalai clique once again let people clearly see , hidden under the hypocritical face of " guardian of human rights " of the 14th Dalai Lama , its bloody nature of harming human lives , harming society , trampling on human rights , and splitting the motherland .  
Over the last 50 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet , epoch-making and deep-going changes have taken place in Tibet . It has completed democratic reform , abolished the feudal serf system , and realized the regional autonomy of minority nationalities .  Millions of serfs who did not even have basic human rights in the past have truly become masters of society and the country .  
Asia and Europe are also known for superior economic , scientific , and technological strength , rich human resources , and vast markets which can not be found elsewhere , and this has provided a sound basis for the two sides to strengthen bilateral cooperation .  
Lenin said : " Only by being armed with all human knowledge can one become a communist . "  Only the new type of military personnel armed with all human knowledge , especially modern high-science and - technology knowledge , can accomplish our military 's historical mission of prevailing on the battlefield and remaining unchanged in nature .  
They have taken advantage of the channels of international economic and cultural exchanges and dissemination to energetically advertise the political concepts of bourgeois democracy , freedom , and human rights , pursue egoistic values , advocate the reactionary views of divesting armed forces of party leadership and depoliticizing them , vilify CPC leadership , and wage an all-out attack against China 's socialist system with the aim of bringing about a credibility crisis or confidence crisis among the people , who will eventually abandon party leadership and the socialist system .  
In recent years , in particular , the Western hostile forces have made use of the theories of human rights , globalization , and environmental protection , which are of common concern to the people , to pursue their strategy of westernization and disintegration behind a fashionable facade and under the pretence of the scientific nature of academic research , the objective nature of news reports , and the recreational nature of literary and art works and , for this reason , they are very confusing and deceptive .  
If this situation is not resolved , people will be unable to clearly distinguish between the problems of national position , the independence and reunification issue and values of political parties and ideology , and will be unable to understand that free and democratic human rights can not supersede the framework of national sovereignty and the integrity of territory .  The DPP government of Chen Shui-bian can not let go of their evil intentions in the form of a coalition government .  
It organically combines being rigorously scientific with being highly revolutionary , expounds profound theories with simple and easily understood language , and uses irrefutable facts and incontrovertible logic to reveal laws of development of human society , thereby pointing out the correct direction of human progress and social development and becoming an immortal monument to intellectual activity in the history of human civilization .  
It critically incorporated British and French utopian socialism 's theory on fairness and justice in human society , the rational cores of dialectics of Germany 's classical philosophy and materialism , British classical political economy 's method for dissecting the capitalist economy , and intellectual pith in the latest achievements of natural sciences .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
It embodies the outstanding intelligence , courage , and innovation of the leaders of the five countries .  It has made precious contributions to the efforts made by human society in transcending the Cold War mentality and establishing a brand-new model for international relations .  It has introduced a new security concept , which is based on mutual trust , disarmament , and cooperative security .  
The exhibition is vivid teaching material for party history .  It is of great , realistic significance for us to run the government and educate people in line with history , accurately understand and grasp the law governing the development of human society , and inherit and carry forward the party 's fine traditions and work styles under new historical conditions .  
He stressed China must sensitively keep pace with the general trend of the current scientific-technological development , fully assess the great significance of future scientific-technological development to human society , heighten their sense of urgency and , taking into consideration of the actual needs of China 's development , act immediately to catch up with the world 's advanced scientific and technological research and press forward to create a new situation for China 's thriving scientific-technological development .  
This is not only a good method of resolving the issue of a lack of funds , but will also bring in professional human resources , information , advanced technology and management expertise , and scientific marketing networks .  This will promote the enhancement of local products ' quality and the local enterprises ' competitive power in the international market , and will thus bring great benefits to the economic development in the western areas .  
We adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace .  We have carried out friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries and treated one another as equals on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in a ceaseless effort to advance the cause of human progress .  
Through development of more than 50 years , especially in the development of reform and opening up during the past two decades , China has established important ideological and political foundation and possessed a material , technological and human resource foundation for achieving the main modernization by the middle of this century .  
In this speech , standing in the forefront of the times , setting his feet on new practice , and mastering the features of the times , Comrade Jiang Zemin applied the basic theory of Marxism to have studied and answered the important issues about the practice of building socialism , deepened the understanding about the laws governing communist parties holding power , governing the building of socialism , and governing the development of human society , thus making new contributions to enriching and developing Marxism .  
It is necessary to inherit and carry forward all good cultures , including the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , the revolutionary cultural tradition formed by the party and the people over a long time , and all advanced civilization achievements created by human society , and strive to develop our national and scientific socialist culture oriented to modernization , to the world , and to the future .  
To improve the party 's leadership and party building , we must first proceed from these two major transformations to earnestly study theoretical and practical issues facing party building under the new historical conditions and study the laws governing the rule of the country by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and the development of human society that underlie these issues so as to better advance party building .  
In accordance with their international obligations and national laws and regulations , the two parties will take effective steps to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of legal and human entities of one party in the territory of the other party , and will provide each other with the necessary assistance in civil and criminal adjudication .  
The US ground force has deemed it imperative to build mobile command centers , ensure rapid and long-range mobilization , handle a huge amount of transmitted information , introduce highly efficient planning procedures , and re-divide work between human beings and machines , so that staff offices will mainly perform direct calculations on software while commanding officers and staff officers will mainly handle a dynamic situation a machine can not . 
On the basis of bilateral cooperation and in accordance with the respective development targets and advantages of China and ASEAN , the Chinese side proposes to identify the five areas of agriculture , human resources development , cooperative development of the Mekong River Basin , information and communications technologies and mutual investment as key areas for China-ASEAN cooperation in the first few years of the new century in order to make more effective and centralized use of the resources and strengths of both sides .  
We must willingly combine subjective efforts and objective world , theory and practice , and inheritance and development of legacies , deepen our understanding of the laws governing the running of the government by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and human society so that we think and act more in line with the national condition at the initial stage of socialism and the requirements of the development of the times and think and act more in line with the actual conditions in Jiangsu Province and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
Besides , the Corps has also mapped out a series of rules and regulations , renovated and transformed the bulk of its installations , correspondingly erected a number of facilities of a preliminary scale , and introduced a whole set of automatic management systems , thus bringing about a leap forward for operational positions management , from human operations to automated operations .  
Since the 1991 Gulf War , the US and British aircraft have been flying on patrol missions in two " no-fly zones , " set up over the north and south of Iraq respectively , frequently striking at various civilian and military targets in Iraq , and resulting in losses in human life and property .  
A few local businesses and blood banks acted without authorization in Henan to set up clinics that collected plasma only , and operated in violation of regulations , collecting large amounts of plasma and purchasing raw plasma .  This resulted in the human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] being spread widely among the throng who sold blood at these clinics , with Wenlou Village , in Shangcai County 's Lugang Township , being one of the villages with the most serious epidemic conditions .  
As has been learned from relevant departments in mid-August , the Second Artillery Corps has achieved fruitful results in its personnel construction thanks to ceaseless efforts in implementing the " human resources relay " project .  The average age of leaders of the major technological posts of all missile brigades as well as the research offices and the teaching and research offices of all scientific research institutes is about 40 , and 72 percent of them are under 40 years of age .  
Wu Hailong said that this year the APEC meeting discussed in depth trade and investment liberalization , strengthening of a multilateral trade structure , economic and technological cooperation , exploitation of human resources , and new economies , among other issues .  The results achieved in the meeting laid a sound foundation for the October informal APEC leaders ' meeting and ministerial meeting to be held in Shanghai .  
A case involving human life is to be treated with the utmost care .  Since the founding of new China , and especially since the launch of reforms and opening up , the Chinese Government has consistently attached extremely great importance to production safety ; it has organized and drawn up various laws and regulations , and laid down the guideline of " safety first , prevention first , " with the result that the state of production safety has gradually improved each year .  
Ministers and their representatives from member economies reached a common understanding on a wide range of issues , such as cooperation in advancing technological innovation , facilitating financing , improving the environment for SME development , strengthening SME human capacity building and interacting with the business sector , put forward many proposals for future growth , and adopted the Joint Ministerial Statement of the Eighth APEC SME Ministerial Meeting .  
He said : China persistently pursues an independent and peace-oriented foreign policy , developing friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , treating each other equally , enjoying mutual benefits , and jointly forging ahead the cause of human progress .  
Regarding the request made to the NPC to interpret the law , the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong people and foreigners who are truly concerned about Hong Kong have come to realize that had the SAR Government not promptly requested the NPC to interpret the law , 1.6 million mainlanders would have rushed into Hong Kong , causing tremendous unbearable impact on Hong Kong 's basic human rights , including rights in the areas of housing , education , medical service , and social order .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
The practices of ignoring the actual situation , criticizing the situation of human rights in other countries by wearing colored glasses , and even interfering in other countries ' domestic affairs under the pretext of " safeguarding " human rights , are in fact grossly trampling on human rights .  The move is not beneficial to the development of the international cause of human rights .  It also sabotages the North-South relations .  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
In the past year , the Chinese Government has made efforts to realize the people 's economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to promote and protect the citizens ' political rights , and has made remarkable progress in this respect , thus comprehensively raising the level of enjoying various human rights by the Chinese people .  
Modern human society is made up of numerous rules , and wars , as a normal human activity , have always been constrained by these rules ; certain kinds of warfare have always been prohibited .  The reason human beings have evolved from their primitive state to create nations and societies is that they have this kind of moral and compelling laws and rules and regulations .  
After the Cold War , although the United States ' military development has advanced to a level unprecedented in human history , the international rules and international order have remained in effect .  The Americans have not gone all out , like other imperial expansionists we are familiar with in world history , to forcefully establish hegemony based purely on military power similar to the kind we know in history .  
To safeguard the interests of their own bourgeois class , Western countries headed by the United States have used political , economic , and military means to enforce their political system , ideology , and human rights concept in the international community and to grossly interfere in the internal affairs and trample on the sovereignty of other countries .  
Fallacies such as " human rights above sovereignty " and " human rights have no national boundaries " are merely the false reasoning and excuses it uses for disregarding the international law and for grossly interfering in the internal affairs and unscrupulously encroaching on the sovereignty of other countries .  They are an open provocation against modern international law .  
The " one country , two systems " formula is a new attempt unprecedented in human history .  However , Hong Kong people have succeeded .  Besides overcoming the difficulties and burden left over by the colonial rulers , Hong Kong withstood the external economic storm as well as the attempt by internal and external forces to " resist China and throw Hong Kong into chaos " when it was not yet stable during the initial period after the handover .  
In accordance with the agreement on trade relations signed soon after China and the United States established diplomatic ties in 1979 , the two sides should mutually grant " MFN treatment " to each other .  However , the United States adopted the annual appraisal system for the " MFN treatment " for China in accordance with its relevant domestic law .  It further attached some conditions related to " human rights " in the process of implementation .  
The rich human resources , high proportion of young and middle-aged population , notable cost advantages , and the state 's measures to lighten the burdens of state-owned enterprises , divert surplus personnel to other jobs , and separate the functions of running social undertakings are all conducive to heightening labor productivity .  
That the United States has always ignored facts , played the same old tune , and slandered the situation of human rights in China and other developing countries is caused by its hegemonic mental state of Cold War mentality .  It has implemented its values and ideology with a strong sense of superiority , practiced dual standards on the human rights issue , and politicized the human rights issue .  
In the past 50 years since the founding of new China , especially in the past 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the level of the people 's material and cultural life has constantly been raised , and the human rights cause , being a part of these achievements , has also made comprehensive and concrete progress personally experienced by the Chinese people on the basis of the constant development of the economy in China .  
Even in the United States , which is the most developed country in the world , there are many problems in its human rights situation .  But the United States has never looked squarely at its own human rights problems , still less has it published an annual report on its own human rights situation .  Instead , it compiled a white paper on other country 's human rights in accordance with its own standards and its incorrect and partial data and used it as the means for interfering in other country 's internal affairs .  
The nation provides effective assurance , on a system , legal , and material level , for the enjoyment and realization of human rights , initially forming a socialist human rights safeguard system with special Chinese characteristics , and thus enabling Chinese human rights to truly possess a widespread , equal , and authentic nature .  
The Chinese constitution stipulates that the citizens enjoyment of full and extensive human rights is the basic right and freedom making up the chief content of human rights ; the constitution stipulates that when the citizens execute their rights and freedoms , they can not harm the national , societal , or collective interests , nor impinge on the freedom and rights of other citizens ;  
Regarding the request made to the NPC to interpret the law , the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong people and foreigners who are truly concerned about Hong Kong have come to realize that had the SAR Government not promptly requested the NPC to interpret the law , 1.6 million mainlanders would have rushed into Hong Kong , causing tremendous unbearable impact on Hong Kong 's basic human rights , including rights in the areas of housing , education , medical service , and social order .

Li Tieying pointed out : The western regions have rich hydropower , mineral , and biological resources and numerous sites of human civilization and natural scenery .  Many industries have established a good foundation in the regions .  
Nevertheless , with a guilty conscience , he did not dare to use expressions like " two countries " but carefully chose a neutral expression such as " the two sides of the Taiwan Straits . " He said that " the same historical experiences should have laid a solid foundation for the people living on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits to gain mutual understanding and commonly seek freedom , democracy , human rights , . .  
As the US bill contains clauses that attempt to use human rights and other pretexts to interfere in China 's internal affairs and damage China 's interests , the Chinese side has called on the US side to conscientiously observe the three Sino-US joint communiques and the basic norms of international relations in order to ensure that Sino-US relations , as well as economic and trade exchanges , will develop in a healthy and stable direction .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
On the other hand , the desire for peace , cooperation , and development has become an irresistible trend of the times .  The voice of the vast numbers of developing countries demanding dialogue and countering confrontation , safeguarding the purpose and principles of the UN Charter , and fighting against the use of human rights to meddle in the internal affairs of other countries , is running high .  
The Tibet issue has all along been a " human rights " hot spot ; even then the CSHRS has not evaded this difficult issue but instead has expounded , with a host of facts , on the great changes that have taken place since Tibet implemented the democratic reform and wiped out the feudal serfdom to refute the Dalai clique and international hostile forces ' distortions of and attacks on Tibet 's human rights situation .  
Meanwhile , the CSHRS must continue to take an active part in international human rights activities ; conduct more dialogues , exchanges , and cooperation with foreign organizations and personages ; and make unremitting efforts to enhance understanding and cooperation between the Chinese people and the peoples of all countries in the world in upholding human rights , expand consensus unceasingly , and jointly promote the international community 's universal respect of human rights and basic freedom .  
His aim and sinister ambition was to portray himself as a saint protecting the democracy and human rights of the 23 million people of Taiwan and to imply that the government of the Chinese mainland and the CPC , which oppose his criminal behavior , are an autocratic devil opposed to democracy and human rights , in a bid to stir up bad feeling between the Taiwan compatriots and the mainland of the motherland and pin on it the responsibility for the tense situation in the Taiwan strait and for a possible war .  
In particular , when its features of opposing the KMT 's autocratic and despotic rule and opposing the CPC 's and communism 's deprivation of democracy and human rights emerge , lured by the fragrant " western meal " of " democracy and human rights , " the program is powerfully bewitching and deceptive , and thus gained support and adherents .  
The anti-China activities of " Taiwan independence thinkers " were coordinated with those of western anti-China political forces and human rights organizations , with east and west singing in tune ; they groundlessly labelled the mainland of the motherland as " opposed to democracy and human rights " ; for instance they frequently applied their self-flaunted " democracy and human rights " to abuse the CPC 's opposition to " Taiwan independence " as oppressing Taiwan with " nationalism " and " great Han chauvinism . "  
It is still unknown whether the reform of the new Taiwan authorities , centered on and motivated by " democracy and human rights , " will be effective in the economic sphere to again achieve a miracle in the free market economy .  However , it is conceivable that this reform of " democracy and human rights " and " rule by law " will objectively bring greater troubles for the motherland 's peace and reunification in disregard of the people 's will .  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
It is conceivable that the series of matters on international human rights that were given assurance in Chen Shui-bian 's inaugural speech will surely bring forth unprecedented warm relations between them and international anti-China forces and human rights organizations , and lead to international human rights organization conducting activities in Taiwan " legally , " thereby winning direct and indirectly new support and protection for " Taiwan independence . "  
More importantly , Chen Shui-bian publicly announced in his inaugural speech that he would hold high the " human rights above sovereignty " banner and continue to carry forward and explore the potential of the " democracy and human rights " weapon , and is prepared to cooperate closely with international human rights organizations of the West and Amnesty International and actively participated in international NGO 's .  
Of equal importance is the fact that we must use practical and effective measures to deal with the Taiwan authorities in international " human rights above sovereignty " activities .  In particular , regarding the activities they carry out in western countries , we must have a plan for response , we must take initiative , and we must have a definite scope and counterpoint .  
When elucidating the human rights situation of the motherland of China , it is very correct to emphasize that the right to survive is fundamental .  However , explaining " democracy and human rights " to the Taiwan compatriots is even more complicated , and is also very difficult to manage .  But , this is possibly much more powerful than guided missiles , so it is worth striving to try to do .  
Deng Xiaoping advanced the theory on the implementation of the open policy in socialist states and took the open policy as a basic national policy on China 's socialist construction .  To gain advantages comparable with that of capitalism , Deng noted , socialism should boldly absorb and use all civilized achievements created by human society , including developed capitalist states ' advanced operational and managerial approaches that reflect the law of modern socialized production .  
Li Peng said : China similarly respects the general principle of the international community on human rights .  However , we feel that as countries have different social systems , economic conditions , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , and religious beliefs , they do not share an identical understanding of human rights .  This is very natural .  
In the past 50 years , the Chinese Government has not only basically provided enough food and clothing for 1.2 billion people and greatly raised the people 's living standards , but also allowed the people to enjoy civil , political , economic , social , cultural , and educational rights on the basis of the Constitution and law .  We can say that China 's current human rights situation is in the best period in history .  
since our party represents the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , it must persistently take Marxism as the guide , inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , study and absorb all the fruits of human civilization , and continually build and create socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , so that material and spiritual civilization will develop in coordinated fashion and promote the all-round progress of society ;  
It is said that in April a joint smuggling scheme between the Shanghai Airport and Port was uncovered , and five Chinese businessmen holding fake passports for small African countries were detained and interrogated .  Their backgrounds involved an international human smuggling ring stretching across Asia and Africa and also included diplomatic officials of African nations .  
The Chinese Government 's stance in opposing illegal human smuggling and illegal immigration has always been specific , and China has always adopted the attitude of active cooperation with the countries concerned in handling illegal immigration ; China will take back those verified to be Chinese citizens who had left mainland China .  
In April and June , Shanghai 's police departments successively launched two united campaigns , " making concerted efforts to crack down on human traders and to rescue women and children who have been kidnapped and sold . "  Over 10,000 people 's policemen and public security joint vigilance committee personnel daily joined in the campaigns and arrested 27 human traders .  
The incident in which the dead bodies of Chinese stowaways were discovered at Dover , Britain , several days ago has shocked the international community .  In the view of the official , the incident shows it is highly necessary to step up international cooperation in cracking down on the human smuggling crimes instigated by snakeheads .  
However , since the international community has failed to launch a forceful crackdown on organized international criminal gangs owing to the loopholes in the laws of certain countries , such as " political asylum " and " respect for human rights , " the activities of illegal migration have been revived like dying cinders glowing again and have persisted despite repeated prohibitions , thus doing tremendous harm to the society .  
As regards human rights , Li Peng has stressed and pointed out : It is impossible to demand that various countries follow the same viewpoint or mechanically transplant the same mode on the question of human rights , for human rights is an integral concept , and complete and common human rights should include not only the political rights of citizens but also the economic , social , and cultural rights , especially the right of survival and the right of development . 
Chen Shui-bian calls the mainland 's struggle against " Taiwan independence " hegemonism , and has confused state sovereignty with human rights .  He has attempted to sow dissension among the compatriots in Taiwan , the international community , and the mainland , and publicly promoted official relations between Taiwan and the United States , in addition to meddling with the social and political affairs of the mainland .  
repeatedly talked nonsense at international occasions ; made malicious and entirely groundless accusations against the policy of the Chinese Government towards Tibet ; and wantonly spread such rumors as that " the human rights situation in Tibet is deteriorating , " " the Tibetan culture has become extinct , " and " there is no religious freedom in Tibet , " thus turning himself into a " master of wild lies . "  
President Jiang Zemin delivered a written speech at the airport .  He said mankind is looking forward to the dawn of the 21st century , adding that people hope this century will be a century of peace and development , for the establishment of a new , just and rational international political and economic order in this century , and for brilliant human civilization in this century .  
In his " 20 May " inaugural speech , he made a comprehensive paraphrase of the new middle-of-the-road line and maintained that it would be a road leading Taiwan to a heavenly state as " an example in democracy and human rights in the world . "  After assuming presidency , he has also indeed worked hard for it .  
The new middle-of-the-road line is a complete " Taiwan independence " theory and strategic program , its core idea is the so-called " democracy and human rights , " and its ultimate purpose and actual intention are to avert the debate over reunification and independence , solidify the foundation and strength for the " Taiwan independent " mindset , and comprehensively counter the one China principle with a new form and scale .  It is in reality a vicious conspiracy of de facto " Taiwan independence . "  
Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
6 .  All sides indicate they will resolutely uphold the purpose and principles of the UN Charter ; restate the legitimate rights of all countries to choose their own paths of political , economic , and social development according to their national conditions ; oppose intervention in other countries ' internal affairs on the pretexts of " humanitarianism " and " protecting human rights ; " and support the efforts of one another in safeguarding the five countries ' national independence , sovereignty , territorial integrity , and social stability .

Wei Ruixing pointed out : The Chinese Government has banned the " Falungong " evil cult in accordance with law , and punished a very small number of the cult-related criminals who have brought about serious harm to society .  The Chinese Government has protected the human rights and freedom of the broad masses of the people in China , and safeguarded the stability of social order as a result .  The practice has won support from the broad masses of the Chinese citizens , and is completely legal and rightful .  
For this reason , Jamyang maintained that the human society should work together to eradicate misunderstanding ; should remove negative factors impairing economic development ; and should create a favorable environment for economic development so as to create conditions for protecting or developing the cultural heritage of nationalities .  
As reflected in various localities , in the past , some enterprises with a fairly great number of retired workers had to assign a person to take charge of issuing pensions every month , and this wasted a lot of human and material resources .  After the implementation of socialized distribution of pensions , the management of retirees will be separated from enterprises ; the burdens of enterprises will be greatly reduced and their operational vitality will be noticeably strengthened .  
4 .  To provide highly proficient talents essential for transforming science and technology into products and industrializing high technologies , we have set up scientific mechanisms governing personnel hiring , created an environment that can retain talented personnel , and intensified our efforts in developing human resources .  We have drawn up the " Beijing Regulations for Encouraging Students Studying Abroad To Come to Beijing To Start Their Pioneering Businesses . " The project of recruiting proficient high-tech personnel from all parts of the country is going on .  
In particular , in the contemporary world , from nature to human society , from the economic and political realms to culture and science , things are developing and changing at a speed unimaginable to people in the previous periods .  
Shen Guofang pointed out that the summit would adopt a final document .  Many Western nations maintain that in the upcoming new century , the idea of human rights overriding everything should be included in the document .  However , most of the developing nations , including China , are against this formulation and hold that resolutely safeguarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity should be written in the document , instead .  
when the government of the special zone submitted a proposal to the National People 's Congress to " explain the law " in order to check the possibility of the appearance of a human wave sweeping Hong Kong , they declared " the rule of law is dead . "  In the legislature they wore white flowers [ a symbol of mourning ] and left the arena .

Li Peng stressed : China and Russia share extensive common interests ; and have had fruitful cooperation in a series of major international issues in recent years , including human rights , the anti-missile issue [ fan dao ] , arms control , and the reform of the United Nations . Such cooperation should go on in the future . 
From April to July this year , the ministry mobilized public security organs to conduct a massive special struggle of cracking down on traders in human beings to rescue women and children abducted for sale .  With the vigorous support of all sides in the society , public security organs at all levels meticulously organized and planned their action , and the large number of public security and people 's police officers worked unceasingly hard and struggled arduously .  
The source also revealed that since the First Branch of the Beijing Municipal People 's Procuratorate took over Li Jizhou 's case from a special investigation team set up by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission in mid-June of this year , the procuratorial organs concerned have carried out investigations or collected evidence for more than three months .  The authorities have confirmed from both the human testimony and material evidence available that Li Jizhou is a suspect who has taken a huge amount of bribes by abusing his power through shielding smuggling ; issuing licenses to smuggled vehicles ;  
What warrants people 's special attention at present is that as tough measures are unworkable , they are replaced by soft measures such as intervention in the name of humanitarianism , human rights overriding sovereignty , human rights prevailing over everything , and global intervention without boundaries .  
It is necessary to firmly implement the strategy of relying science and education for national regeneration , greatly promote scientific and technological innovation and progress , effectively development human resources , and provide strong driving forces for economic growth and social progress .

As the industrial structure continues to be optimized , the level of coordination and cooperation between central-western regions and the eastern part of the country will also be continuously upgraded ; the traditional mode of interaction between the resource supplying bases and processing bases will be broken down ; and all-dimension exchanges in capital , technology , human resources , and information will take place between the eastern and western regions .  
The development of human society tells us that crime is a factor hindering social stability and progress .  It undermines the normal operation of political structures , the correct implementation of state laws and regulations , disturbs social order , and corrodes people 's moral character and spiritual world .  
Scientific discoveries move people to form scientific principles in the process of understanding the world , while the mission of engineering and technological sciences is to transform scientific principles into dynamic forces to remold the world .  Engineering and technological sciences form the bridge between scientific discoveries and industrial development , and they are powerful levers for industrial revolutions , economic development , and social progress .  Watt 's invention of the steam engine triggered the first industrial revolution and had a far-reaching and profound impact on human society .  
The highly effective application of aerospace technology in the fields of telecommunications , broadcast , meteorology , resources , satellite navigation and orientation , and so on has brought about tremendous changes in human productive forces and lifestyles and pushed forward economic development and social progress .  
After comparing the completely different prospects for the stock markets across the Taiwan strait , Kao Ching-yuan , chairman of Taiwan 's President Group , and Wang You-zen , chairman of Taiwan 's Libar group , pointed out in a clear-cut manner at a forum sponsored by the TAIEX and attended by heads of Taiwan 's listed companies that the free fall of Taiwan 's stock market was not due to the economic factors .  Wang You-zen was more direct , saying " human factor " was the cause of Taiwan 's stock market blue .  
As the primary productive forces , science and technology are growing and expanding rapidly in the fields ranging from synthetic insulin to the cultivation of hybrid rice high-yield variety , and from human genome plan to the basic research and development of nanometer technologies , and the contribution rate of scientific and technological progress to the national economic growth has rapidly risen to nearly 40 percent .  
He said : Syria is one of the first Arab states that established diplomatic ties with China . It is also an important and influential country in the Middle East . China has all along attached importance to developing friendly relations with Syria and has spoken highly of Syria 's long-term firm support for China on the issues of human rights and Taiwan .  
We should unswervingly arm the minds of young cadres with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought and , in particular , Deng Xiaoping Theory , foster their fine style with the party 's fine traditions and strict management , enhance their professional level with modern scientific and technological knowledge and the fine achievements of civilization created by human society , and heighten the quality of young cadres in all respects , so as to guarantee that the cause of socialist modernization will be carried forward and forged ahead in a pioneering spirit .  
It has also strengthened the execution and supervision of the state compulsory norms and established a report system .  Generally speaking , the quality of the immigration project is good .  However , there are still some problems , such as the relatively poor quality of the design results , the nonstandard invitation of bidding , the undertaking of projects by the units without human quality , the replacement of supervision with quality inspection , and the improper punishment to the persons responsible for causing quality accidents .  
Under a new situation , we always insist on the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture and push the prosperous development of socialism 's culture and art to satisfy the growing need for peoples ' cultural spirit , and provide the insured thoughts , motives of spirit and intellectual support for economic development and improvement of the whole society , and build a nice social atmosphere and human cultural circumstance , above are honorable and difficult historical responsibilities of the cultural and art workers .  
Reportedly , the Chinese Government has attached importance to the development of human and social sciences .  " Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend , " encouraging academic exchanges with foreign countries , and intensifying research on international cooperation are the guiding principles for China 's efforts to develop and enliven human and social sciences .  
During the 1992 presidential election , Clinton condemned President Bush Sr . for ingratiating himself with the " Beijing butchers . "  After taking office , Clinton , as expected , was very tough with the CPC on human rights issues and threatened to link bilateral trade relations with human rights after taking office .  Only when bilateral relations worsened dramatically did Clinton begin to revise his strategy .  
The fifth plenary session of the 15th party central committee , which was held not long ago , regarded the development of human resources as an important strategic task that determines the future of China , and explicitly proposed that " qualified personnel are the most valuable resources , " and the " leading personnel are the crucial elements that carry on past traditions and open up a way to forge ahead into the future . "  
We advise the United States to give prime consideration to the general situation of Sino-US relations , truly act according to the three Sino-US joint communiques and the basic norms of international relations , stop interfering in China 's internal affairs using the Taiwan , Tibet , human rights , and other issues , and not do anything harmful to Sino-US relations .

The " Falungong " and other cults worship their founders in a big way and cook up false reasoning and heresies to profane human dignity , to jeopardize social stability , and to hoodwink the good and honest masses in an attempt to achieve their evil , ulterior , anti-human , anti-social , and anti-science purposes .  
They should be good at learning from and drawing on all the outstanding achievements of human civilizations and at inheriting and carrying forward all the outstanding ideas , morals , and cultural traditions of the Chinese nation ; they should effectively resist the corroding influence of all negative , decadent ideologies and cultures and always maintain the socialist mental outlook .  
It was stressed at the eighth APEC informal leadership meeting that APEC needs to enhance economic and technological cooperation centered on human capacity building and human resource development so as to narrow gaps between member states and to realize common development .  
Today , all we 're doing , such as conducting economic construction , building spiritual civilization , building democracy , and building a legal system , are in the final analysis aimed at ensuring that the 1.2 billion Chinese people will live and work in peace and contentment and will fully enjoy all types of human rights and basic freedoms .  
Since the founding of the New China , the Chinese Government has constantly been working hard to protect and develop human rights , and has made unremitting efforts to eliminate poverty and backwardness , to build a wealthy and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization , and to realize the ideal of human rights .  Great achievements have also been made in this regard .  
Economic globalization is the necessity of the development of large-scale socialized production , and is the new height and stage of this development , in which resources and social production factors are allocated in the most effective way on a global scale .  It represents the most advanced production mode and productive force hitherto seen in human society and will become the economic base of world peace , universal harmony , and the future new society of mankind .  
in particular , political forces standing for human rights and environmental protection and opposing free trade have continually expanded , with the result that it was very difficult for Gore to build a broad and close-knit Democratic Party campaign alliance . 
second , for the first time it set out comprehensive , systematic , and effective frameworks for handling bilateral relations , from the leaders ' hot line to the mechanism for dialogue on human rights , and from military exchanges to cooperation in law enforcement .  
while trade unions , environmental protection and human rights organizations within the Democratic Party are quite active in recent years , opposing free trade and intensifying their liberal stand on many social issues .  
The Chinese Government and people are speeding up reforms of the economic and political systems , putting into effect an economic and social development strategy geared to the 21st century , and practicing an administrative strategy of ruling the country according to law and building a state with legal system .  All this is in the final analysis aimed at fundamentally and continually improving the state of human rights in China .  
To improve the quality of workers and provide effective human resources support for the sustained and fast development of the national economy is a strategic task for the labor security cause .  Zhang Zuoji said : For some time to come , it is necessary to regard the vocational qualification certificate system as the point of breakthrough for the improvement of the quality of workers and popularize the vocational qualification certificate system in a comprehensive way .  
The backward steps of Taiwan 's authorities have caused relations across the Strait to constantly worsen , and have led to disorder and loss of confidence on the island .  As a result , investment has stagnated , the economy has gone into a recession , there has been a huge outflow of capital and human resources , and the stock market has plummeted to a nearly five-year low , with a closing figure yesterday of 4721 points .  Things are tight all over , and the unemployment rate is reaching a 15-year record high .  
Ambassador Li said , certain American politicians are still interfering in China 's internal affairs with regard to issues such as Tibet , religion , and human rights , or else pursuing double standards , and preaching the " theory of the China threat " heedless of the facts ; this is particularly harmful and dangerous .  
In short , we should vigorously facilitate the rational circulation and optimum allocation of production elements to ensure that material , financial , and human resources are turned to best account and bring into full play the role of markets and resources at home and abroad in the large-scale western development .  
They sedulously arranged for the " Falun Gong " elements to spread the fantastic rumor about the Chinese Government 's persecution of the " Falun Gong " followers at the hearing on the so-called " human rights issues in China and Tibet , " held by the US Congress Foreign Relations Committee , and invited Li Hongzhi 's right-hand assistants and " pro-democracy " and " Tibetan independence " elements to attend the hearing on the so-called " issues of religious freedom in China , " to prepare public opinion for the anti-China proposal .  
This cult organization has moved against the historical current , is completely antagonistic to the scientific world , has tarnished human civilization , and has obstructed social progress .  These have determined its inevitable fate of a rapid destruction .  
In order to preserve social stability and tranquillity and protect basic human rights and freedoms , the Chinese Government has banned the " Falungong " organization and punished according to law a very small number of lawless and criminal elements ; and it has carried out thorough and meticulous work to educate and convert the great majority of those who were led astray , to enable them to return to a normal life .  
The Ugandan Government adheres to an one-China policy , supports China 's grand cause of cooperation , and has coordinated with and supported China on such major international issues as human rights and anti-missile treaties .  We would like to express our appreciation and gratitude for all this , and we are satisfied with the current development of our bilateral relations .  
They were shocked by and indignant at such an organized and planned scheme , claiming that this incident once again unmasked " Falungong 's " antihuman and antisocial essence of cruelly injuring or killing the people and trampling on human rights .  
In the incident , several people obsessed with " Falungong , " who were under the spiritual control of Li Hongzhi , attempted to burn themselves to death , turning a blind eye to both love in the world and love in their families and displaying not the least virtue or intuitive knowledge as human beings , and have thus destroyed themselves , their families , and their children as well .  
The self-immolation incident created by several obsessed " Falungong " practitioners on the eve of the Chinese New Year at Tiananmen Square shocked people in all circles and aroused righteous resentment .  People in the overseas Chinese affairs circles today held a meeting to strongly condemn the " Falungong " evil cult 's crime of inhumanely trampling upon human lives .  
The political system may vary from one country to another , but all countries in the world share the same task of cracking down on evil cults and drug trafficking .  He called on all nations in the world to make joint efforts to thoroughly eliminate evil cults and drugs by casting aside their political differences and join hands in building a healthier and better living environment for all human being and creating a clean world without drugs , without pollution , without evil cults , and without spiritual opium for future generations .  
Participating jurists pointed out that Li Hongzhi and his evil " Falungong " cult were the plotters and instigators of the case in which a number of stubborn " Falungong " members set themselves on fire at Tienanmen Square . By doing so these " Falungong " members did themselves bodily harm , abused human rights , and seriously broke China 's criminal law .  It is necessary to crack down on these people according to law to guard the authority and sanctity of the law and to maintain political stability and unity .  
The open letter emphasized : " The Chinese Government 's ban of the cultish organization of ' Falungong ' is a correct measure and the actual deed to safeguard the country 's political power and social stability , the sound mind and body of the people and the personal interests of the Chinese people .  It is to uphold the basic human rights of the Chinese people , which is purely an internal affair of China . "  
In February , 2000 , the French Government 's Interministerial Committee on Opposing Evil Cults published its annual report , explicitly defining for the first time an " evil cult " as : " An organization formed in an arbitrary way , which follows a certain religious goal ( no matter whether or not such a goal is made public ) and carries out activities harmful to human rights or social equilibrium . "  
Four senior officials meetings will be held this year .  The upcoming meeting will discuss the economic situation in the Asia-Pacific region , globalization , the new economy , and other issues of common concern .  It also will study , while ensuring the process of APEC 's trade and investment liberalization , how to push forward economic and technological cooperation and carry out regional cooperation in capacity building and exploitation of human resources .  
The experts pointed out : For some time , the " Falungong " cult has created the worship of its founder , exercised spiritual control , concocted heresies , formed secret associations , accumulated wealth by unfair or illegal means , inflicted mortal injuries on human lives , and trampled on human rights .  These are acts in serious violation of the relevant Chinese laws .  
As a cultural system , each religion has drawn on the numerous spiritual assets created in the history of human civilization to become an important part of traditional culture and a way of life for its believers .  Religion has become a stabilizing force in society , playing a unique role in coordinating or balancing various spheres of activity in society .  
Observation team members briefed some 20 overseas Chinese representatives on China 's policy regarding the development of its western regions as well as their economic , scientific , and technological structures , the distribution of natural and human resources , and other characteristics and strong points , adding that the development of China 's western regions serves as an opportunity for them to display their talents , hoping that they will introduce advanced French science , technology , and management to these regions .  
At a news conference after the end of the meeting , Wang Guangya said : the senior officials of all participating economic entities unanimously agreed that APEC should advance economic and technological cooperation in the fields of energy construction and human resources while maintaining the momentum of the process of trade and investment liberalization , and should make efforts to start a new round of multilateral trade talks as early as possible on the basis of formulating a balanced agenda .  
A few days ago , 36 cultural organizations in Hong Kong held an " anti-Falungong " forum to pass a solemn statement on opposing " Falungong " and to sternly condemn " Falungong " as a heretical organization slandering science and opposing the motherland , society , and human beings .  
The " record , " citing the US election campaign and other detailed examples , lays bare the myth of American " democracy " and completely brings to light its escalating violence , unfair judicature , the widening gap between the rich and the poor , worrying economic and social rights of workers , serious gender discrimination , children being in a grim situation , unchanged racial discrimination , bad benefits for minorities , exhausting all resources for military buildup , and brutal infringements on other countries ' human rights .  
As all people know , uranium is a radioactive super-heavy metal , but the United States flatly denied that depleted uranium bombs may have harmful effects on the human health , and obstructed the investigations conducted by the relevant countries and international organizations .  
For other international human rights treaties it has joined , the United States always made reservation , statements , and understanding to ensure that their implementation would be strictly limited within the scope of the US Constitution and other laws , and could only be applied to the federal level and could not be applied to various states .  As a result , the international covenants are a sheer sheet of meaningless paper in the United States .  
Talking about the relationship between handling Falungong and guaranteeing human rights , Liu said : The policy of the Chinese government in handling the Falungong problem is to unite with , educate , and saving most of the practitioners who have been deceived .  The Chinese government has punished a small handful of people in the Falungong cult because they have engaged in illegal and criminal activities , disrupted public order , and violated the Chinese law .  
With the unremitting efforts over a long time , the Chinese people 's living standard has been unprecedentedly improved and the human rights and basic freedoms they enjoy have been raised to an unprecedented high level .  The human rights situation has reached its best period in history and this is a fact obvious to all .  
That the Chinese Government has banned and cracked down on the " Falungong " cult organization according to law is precisely to safeguard and protect the basic human rights and freedoms of the Chinese citizens , and this has won the resolute support of all the people in China and the extensive support of the international community .  
This is also a typical expression of the dual standards for human rights of the United States . China expresses its strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition [ qiang lie bu man he jian jue fan dui ] to this move made by the United States . We demand that the United States abide by the basic norms of international relations , correct its wrongdoings and stop using so-called human rights issues to interfere in China 's internal affairs .  
Liu Jing said : The decision of the Chinese Government on banning " Falungong " was based on the demand of the broad masses and was aimed at safeguarding social stability and protecting the people 's basic human rights and freedoms .  The action has sufficient legal grounds and is completely in keeping with the legal procedures .  
The Chinese Government has always respected the international community 's universal principle on human rights and has actively worked to promote and protect the Chinese people 's human rights and basic freedoms , and tremendous results that have drawn worldwide attention have been achieved .  
Using high technologies , starting from on high to deal with China in the outer space to attract China 's attention , making it concentrate its entire financial , material and human resources , as the former Soviet Union did , on an arms race in the outer space .  Then , cutting the ground from under China 's foot , completely do China in .  Such kind of calculations based on wishful thinking , to be sure , is also very laughable .  
Zeng Jianhui , member of the NPC standing committee and chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee , said : " China has always acknowledged and respected the universal principles of human rights of the international community , committed itself to the promotion and protection of the human rights and basic liberties of its citizens in accordance with its national conditions , and actively facilitated dialogue , exchange , and cooperation in the area of human rights in the international community . "  
He said : The NPC standing committee conducted three rounds of careful deliberations on this treaty within a rather short time and ratified it today .  This is further proof of China 's consistent principled position of attaching importance to the promotion and protection of human rights and of actively advocating and conducting , in a committed way , cooperation in the area of human rights .  
Education lays a foundation for developing human resources , and plays a leading and across-the-board influential role in economic and social development .  We must more effectively carry out the strategy of relying on science and education when pursuing national regeneration .  
equipment is obsolete and outmoded ; technical and professional human resources are insufficient .  The unreasonable distribution of public health resources in rural areas has affected the development of public health undertakings in the vast countryside .  
Jiangsu must seize this opportunity to implement the strategy of relying on science and education to invigorate the country , energetically develop human resources , and promote scientific and technological progress and innovation in order to turn itself into a province with strong scientific and technological resources and provide a powerful driving force for structural readjustment and economic development .  
Deputy Zhang Baoyi , mayor of Zhangjiakou City , said : This is an amazing achievement .  These years , the work of aiding the poor to tackle difficult problems has been done as an important task from the central to local levels , and actual results have been achieved from formulating policies to inputting human , financial , and material resources into this work .  
In the vast central and west region , the natural and human resources are abundant , the operational costs are cheap , the domestic markets are huge , and the scientific and technological development and manufacturing industry have also had considerable foundations .  
When talking about compulsory education , Li Peng pointed out : The new century will be an epoch marked by the great and rapid development of high technologies .  The competition of comprehensive national strength will be determined by the quality of the nationals to a large degree .  The key for development lies in human resources , and education is the foundation .  So it is necessary to put education in a prominent position .  
Some leading cadres , in pursuit of achievements in their official careers , engage in numerical tricks , submit false statistics to the higher authorities , and force the lower levels for high statistical figures , giving rise to local boastfulness , wasting hosts of human , material , and financial resources , and ruining the people 's interests .  
Luo Gan said : The Chinese party and government have always attached great importance to developing good neighborliness , friendship , and all-round cooperation with Vietnam , regarding the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two parties and two countries as not only the demand for invigorating the Chinese national economy and promoting reform and the socialist modernization drive , but also the demand for maintaining regional peace and the peace of the world at large and advancing the cause of human progress .  
The current constitution in Japan was promulgated in November 1946 and implemented starting from May 1947 .  The fundamental idea of the constitution is to forfeit warfare , and support the idea of people having the right to make their own decisions , in addition to guaranteeing the basic human rights .  
We will further popularize advanced and applicable technologies , step up the development of human , scientific , and technological resources , and solve outstanding problems in economic and social development through scientific and technological innovation .  
Through visiting the United States and west Europe and receiving a number of European and US parliamentary delegations visiting China , we have continued to hold friendly and frank dialogue on the Taiwan issue , human rights , religious issues , and China 's WTO accession , thus further promoting mutual understanding and expanding consensus .  
The Chinese Government banned Falungong in accordance with the law for the very purpose of safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .  By dragging the overwhelming majority of Falungong practitioners back to normal social life from the dangerous " realm , " it has saved the lives of many obsessed practitioners and reflected the strong sense of responsibility it , as a staunch human rights protector , has toward people 's lives .  
The spokesman reiterated that the Chinese Government respects human rights and the universal principles of human rights , and starting from China 's concrete national conditions , it has consistently devoted itself to promoting and protecting the human rights and fundamental liberties of the people of China .  
Jiang Zemin gave positive assessment to the development of bilateral relations between China and Djibouti over the past 22 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations , and expressed appreciation and gratitude to Djibouti for its consistent efforts to promote friendship with China and for the valuable support it gave to China for a long time over the Taiwan issue , the human rights issue , and other major international issues .  
After entering the 21st century , the deepening of interdependence between nations has surpassed the limit of human historical experiences , and a " global community " has dimly appeared in an embryonic form .  It is time for the United States , as the designer and protector for the security and economic order of the international community , to discard the diplomatic pattern of self-centered unilateralism and to rely on the coordinating and managing functions of multilateralism .  
Therefore , whether to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan or to expand Sino-U.S . bilateral trade , whether to condemn China for suppressing human rights or to obstruct China from acceding to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) - - all such means are used to achieve one objective , that is , to change the current social system in China . The United States ' national interests can be satisfied to the maximum only by achieving this objective .  
The developed countries are advanced in science and technology and strong in financial capital , while the developing countries are rich in natural and human resources and large in market potential .  
A set of administrative guidelines is being prepared for distribution to private and public hospitals , medical bodies and related organisations to advise those with the responsibility for transplant operations or importing of human organs intended for transplanting , of the relevant procedures and legislative requirements .  
" The rule of law continues to prevail and is being upheld ; people continues to enjoy the freedoms and rights they enjoyed in the past ; there has been no erosion of human rights ; public debates remain lively and demonstrations continue to be a natural part of everyday life ; the press continues to operate openly and freely ; the civil service is the same as it was , and the co - operation with the global and regional partners continues to develop and strengthen . "  
" During the remaining period of the trial , a visible presence of uniformed officers will be maintained on the streets of Hong Kong by the optimum use of human resources and the streamlining of existing work practices , including computer assisted information technology and communications .  
These included Japan 's economic recovery packages , financial and corporate sector restructuring , providing a catalyst for private capital flows , economic and technical co-operation , electronic commerce and ways to strengthen human resource development , economic infrastructure and the science and technological base .  
According to well recognised overseas studies , the coarse fraction of the total suspended particulates will lead to dirt and dust nuisance , and have no long term adverse effect on human health .  
Members are aware that in the 1998 / 99 Budget I announced last February and in the Chief Executive 's Policy Address last October , a wide range of measures to enhance Hong Kong 's productive capacity and competitive edge were set out .  They underline our resolve to seek greater achievements in science and technology , industrial innovation , infrastructure , development of human resources and efficiency and cost effectiveness of the government .  
We expect our educational systems and policies to bring up creative and adaptive young people who are ready to take up their responsibilities towards our society and our country .  We also expect to train up talents with an international outlook as well as a wide scope of knowledge and skills .  They must take pride in their lifelong zeal for learning , seek pleasure in enriching themselves and share the virtues of human beings , " Mr Tung said .

We also expect to train up talents with an international outlook as well as a wide scope of knowledge and skills .  They must take pride in their lifelong zeal for learning , seek pleasure in enriching themselves and share the virtues of human beings .  
I believe we should put in hand an action plan which will highlight the importance of the social and human aspects of economic development , and the needd to address the concerns of the most vulnerable groups of our community and the action plan should incorporate specific projects and programmes which will draw on the best practices in individual economies and on the appropriate advice from business and labour as well as from international organisations .

Internally , the Government will maintain the bedrock of its economic and trade policies , viz low taxes , free trade , free flow of information and the rule of law .  Building on such fundamental principles , we will keep upgrading our hardware ( infrastructure ) and software ( human resources and institutional framework ) in the continuous strive to sharpen our competitive edge and make perfect our business environment .  
However , despite the feverish probings and the virtually endless questioning and finger-pointing , the SAR Government can justifiably boast of an incredibly successful record in protecting human rights and defending its separate systems .

They were statistics on ( i ) research and development inputs ; ( ii ) S &amp; amp ; T human resources ; ( iii ) patents ; ( iv ) external technology flows ; ( v ) S &amp; amp ; T publications ; ad ( vi ) technological innovation .  
The Administration has made relentless efforts in convincing the public and the Human Rights Committee that the provisions of the Public Order Ordinance are consistent with the human rights standards adopted internationally .  Bearing these principles in mind , I would now like to consider the following aspects of the current law , namely the requirement for notification ; the grounds on which public assemblies can be restricted or prohibited ; the sanctions for failure to give notice ; the penalties for such failure ; and the decision-making system .

They are working for a sound development of a multilateral trade regime so that they may complement one another .  
The crime cases involving human life are almost part of everyday 's news .  In solving a crime case , witnesses are , of course , crucial .  Besides , the dead body itself can also reveal critical physical evidence such as cause of death , sequence of events surrounding the death , and persons involving in the crime case .  Forensic science is what we call today to scientifically collect physical evidence of a crime for criminal detection .  
Reaching their hands into the pockets of Chekhov 's shorts , Theatre Smith-Gilmour found a myriad of familiar faces and mismatched human emotions and fueled them with their unique talents and trademark physical and comic magic .

As for the longer-term challenges , Mr Tung said that central to our policy thinking and activities was how we could as a society best make the transition to a knowledge economy from our current starting point in the shortest time possible , ride the waves of progress of China with the greatest success and least economic and human dislocations , and adapt ourselves to the era of globalised competition and in the end come up with an economy that can perform brilliantly in the most demanding and competitive situations .  
* First , we must invest in human capital in a sustained manner and on a vast scale , sufficiently to form a deep , strong base of brainpower to support a knowledge economy with high value-added economic activities .  
In the light of the above , and given our low and simple taxation system , and the competing demands for resources to fund worthwhile human and social development programmes in the years ahead , we , the Government in conjunction with the community , need to carefully examine the long term sustainability of our existing social security schemes .  
This exhibition puts the light on the ubiquitous modern urban experience and reveals the specific schema of human , object and space .  Also , from the most intimate body to personal everyday life , the artists tend to be more interested in excavating kernels of individuality hidden in daily experience .  
With this in mind , the SAR Government has tasked itself with several priorities .  In terms of the software of our infrastructure , we have decided to push forward with educational reforms and to develop our human capital ; to promote innovation and technology amongst Hong Kong people and to encourage enterprises to move up the value chain ; to enhance environmental protection and urban renewal to better our living environment ; and to improve the business environment to attract investments .

Landslides are mainly caused by steep slopes or hillsides , weak weathered rock and rise of groundwater .  Furthermore , some human activities such as unauthorised cultivation , unprotected excavation also cause destruction to the slope surfaces .  As a result , rain water can infiltrate into the slope and soak the soil inside .  The slope then becomes unstable and landslides may easily occur .  
Nowadays , at any time and any place , numerous artificial satellites are bustling above our heads beyond the tranquil sky .  Unmanned spacecrafts bearing the most sophisticated equipment and cameras have been sent to study other members of the Solar System . However , human is superior to the best machine in many aspects .  
But most importantly , someday the Earth will be threatened by resources depletion , asteroid impacts or abrupt changes of solar activities .  Human will be forced to leave the Earth and find a new home in the endless Universe . To prepare for the challenges ahead , we need to understand the effects of prolonged weightlessness and living in confined environment on human 's physiology and psychology .  
To wild dolphins , human is the biggest threat to them apart from shark , its main predator .  Thousands of dolphins die everyday in fishing nets around the world .

Regarding the provision of an accessible , affordable , expeditious and effective mechanism for individuals to seek redress and reparation for alleged violations of human rights , will the Executive Authorities inform this Council whether they have plans to establish an independent Human Rights Commission , with powers to investigate complaints about violation of human rights and to advise the Administration on whether a particular piece of proposed legislation is in compliance with international human rights standards ; if so , of the details of such plans ; if not , the reasons for that ?  
Human rights in Hong Kong are founded on the rule of law , an independent judiciary , the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance ( Cap . 383 ) which incorporated provisions of the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong in our domestic law and empowered the court to grant remedies for contravention of the Ordinance and a sound and comprehensive legal aid system that assures the individuals of access to the courts to seek redress and reparation for alleged violations of human rights .

A proper understanding of the existing law , and of the changes proposed by the Administration will , I believe , demonstrate that there is no cause to fear that human rights will be eroded , that the legislation will have a " chilling effect " on the media , that June 4 protests will be banned in the future , and so on . 
" All our proposals are entirely consistent with human rights protected by the Basic Law .

He further remarked that the Chinese people place equal emphasis on human nature , reasonableness and law . The work of the mediation council is based on the first two considerations , and the agreements it makes possible must have legal standing . Mayor Lee said that the function of mediation councils is a unique feature in the nation 's political history . He is convinced that once the mediation council fully develops its role , people will no longer need to go to the courts to settle their disputes .  
Li uses special machinery to replace human labor , creating slabs of so fine a texture that the grain of the slick wooden mold used for shaping is clearly visible on the surface of the product . As production increased , Li opened a number of " cultural service centers " in smaller towns to offer his products at close-to-cost prices . He also opened a gallery where calligraphers and painters may exhibit their works free of charge .  
The Republic of China is a law-abiding nation and as such does not in any way support or approve of illegal behavior .

Limited land and natural resources creates real problems for directing future industrial development of the nation 's economy . This , however , is offset by a fabulous pool of human resources reflected in a highly educated population and proportionally high percentage of skilled engineers .  
Ricebowls must be compact , easy to hold attractive , and not burn the hands that hold them . Ricebowls that meet these basic needs sell well ; those that do n't stay on the store shelf . Put simply , industrial design aims to make products more attractive and easy to use , requiring a minimum of human effort .  
The fundamental elements of western civilization , from columnar architecture , the aesthetic proportions of the human form and humanistic drama to geometric theorems , democracy and the theory of absolutism , all had their origin in the art and culture of ancient Greece .  
He did n't have enough cash on him so he asked to have one held and to pay for it after he finished his show and got his money . " No wonder they are fascinated .

Encouraged and influenced by Hsu Ts'ang-tse and Huang Chi-ying and absorbing what he could from Japanese photography magazines , Lin gradually learned the true real meaning of " realistic photography " - - capturing an instant of genuine human feeling while paying attention to every aspect of reality .  
In these photographs Huang 's purpose is to record in brilliant color the special character of the cultures in the fast-changing remote areas on the island . By employing , as he says , " the human touch , " he is able to capture the naturalness , warmth , and ingenuousness of his subjects . In shooting them , he adheres to a traditional , classical style of realistic photography .  
The result has been a change from unitary to pluralistic values , from closed ways of thinking to open ones , from moral and ethical considerations as a prime determinant of human relations to utilitarian and materialistic interests , from a simple and impoverished way of life to more prosperous and complex lifestyles .  
The novelist Eileen Chang has described it as " blue skies and green grass . . . clean as though washed in water . " But having lived in Hong Kong and loving China she has also called it " lacking human warmth . " Now , though , people from Hong Kong are stumbling over themselves in the rush to get there .  
Earlier this century people became aware that if things continued in this way they could end up having a hard time even breathing . They came up with the idea of making polluters pay for the cost of the pollution they were responsible for . With that idea , a struggle over environmental rights , like the earlier one over human rights , became inevitable .  
The Buddhist images , relics , bells , drums , wooden fish , and banners used in temples , which are considered objects of superstition by ignorant people , are actually the tools used to polish and clean the human mind . If the human mind is inherently pure and bright , why is there a need for Buddha images much less wooden fish ?  
Then the quality of daily human existence for everyone will improve immeasurably as we march towards the turn of the century . . Establishing a Science CityAll our cities of today will eventually be transformed into science cities . Our economic infrastructure is based on the development of industrial science and technology . This goes hand-in-glove with the modernization of public facilities .  
Science and the fruits of science will be harmoniously integrated with human life . The modernity and completeness of its public facilities will actively promote a well-rounded existence which is pluralistic in both inspiration and application . The result will not only enhance our international image , but it will also turn us into a model of what modern living should be like . .  
These channels include the arterio-vascular system , the lymphatic system and the nervous system familiar to modern medicine , but at the same time neither is it entirely equivalent to these systems .

The lake , which covered 13 acres , was dug out completely by human labor , one stroke at a time . Besides the five pavilions , the lake was surrounded by carved stones and Canadian pines , whose dense needles , twisted roots and gnarled branches were reflected in the tranquil surface of the lake .  
Naturally it would be panic-mongering to suggest that all of these are dangerous to humans , because many of them have an insignificant impact on the human body . For some it is simply a matter of keeping the volume below a certain " permissible amount . " Thus most advanced countries have stipulated methods of controlling chemical products , estimating their danger , the paths by which they are released , and the proper dosages , and setting the scope for their use and permissible amounts within a safe range .  
But one can discover from many popular stories that the Jade Emperor is buy no means beyond anger and fury , completely impersonal and objective , or able to see all the fine points clearly . On the contrary , He is quite " human , " and often becomes angry so that the common people suffer through no fault of their own , or listens to rumors and half-truths .  
Even more interesting is that the Jade Emperor lived long inside the celestial palace , and became rather detached from the conditions of men . Thus every year on the 24th day of the twelfth month on the lunar calender , all the deities who had been sent among men had to return to the court , and report on the beneficence and evil of each human ; they could only return among the people on the fourth day of the first month in the next year .

A Young Forty : It 's a natural human instinct to love singing . Although some criticize Taiwan 's KTV culture as being vulgar , and there are even more people who loudly complain that you have to go to supplementary school even for karaoke , for the vast majority of those who love to sing , whatever the cost in time and money , it 's worth it for that moment of joy of singing a song well , and soaking up the sounds of applause .  
Just ten years ago research into computer " artificial intelligence " was being abandoned as computer researchers around the world were stymied in getting computers to understand models of human thought . Now Chu , who holds boundless enthusiasm for Chinese-language computers , has declared that he has designed " an intelligent Chinese computer " that " can think , learn skills and communicate directly with people using language . " The first stages of its development have already been completed successfully , and it is expected to be formally unveiled within two years . "  
Teeming with life , the river also had a remarkably active course - - which has changed from being bounded by steep U-shaped canyons to having a wide and shallow river bed . Ordinarily this process occurs over the course of thousands of years and can not be observed in a human lifetime .  
This is especially the case in the main area of human settlement east of the Central Mountain Range , the Hua-Tung ( Hualien-Taitung ) Valley , which is a mere three to seven kilometers wide . Taking the Sanmin area for example , within 8.4 kilometers to the west , the land rises from 500 meters above sea level to 3,300 meters , or an average of a rise of one meter for every three meters west that you go .  
Apart from the ups and downs of the political economic situation , Schmidt especially stressed the pessimistic outlook for the environment , raising the problem of population growth and limited resources adding to the worsening of the greenhouse effect and leading to unlimited tides of human migration . "  
Long ago , the busy striving for thoroughness in business and the hectic pace of life led Chen to turn to Confucian principles as an extremely human and practical set of cultural beliefs . He feels sorry that he can not get other modern people to accept them as well .  
At a time of limitless expectations about a prosperous future , we have no way to avoid the heavy costs of technology : environmental pollution , the rapid depletion of natural resources , and even human vulgarity .  
To encourage people to participate and understand that bats are nothing to be afraid of , they set up bat-appreciation spots . These are places where people can go near the mouth of a cave in the evening and see one of nature 's most spectacular and lively sights - - bats leaving the roost . The societies also teach people how to build bat feeders to attract suburban bats and allow them to happily live in a human environment .  
The angry answer comes back that it is society 's search for simplistic explanations that is the problem and that , at his age , the youth is just discovering what a cold , shallow , arrogant culture he lives in - - where the worth of human beings is rated on the basis of the square footage of their homes , their net incomes and exam results , rather than on love and dignity .  
Motorcyclists inhaling carcinogens behind buses , children breathing in particulates that cause respiratory and skin ailments , drivers growing drowsy from carbon monoxide . . . the damage to human health is a huge invisible social cost .  
China 's ancient books have been through human and natural disasters with countless numbers having been destroyed and lost . There are no certain statistics concerning just how many still survive in the world today . Moreover , with there being much space for dispute over how antique works should be carefully determined and compared , it is even more difficult to put numbers on them .  
It is just that if you look at metals such as gold and iron , the former is extremely rare and inert and can not easily undergo chemical changes through combining with other materials , while the latter is used in huge quantities but is actually needed by the human body - - medics even recommend that we use iron cooking pots so as to provide us with supplementary iron .  
When reading Ionesco or Wu we might rejoice that it is not the human race that is endangered , or feel happy that the inhumane phenomenon of forced prison labor is confined to remote China ; we should not forget that the loss of any species to this world , or any trampling on humanity is a serious threat and warning towards anyone who enjoys their human rights and art . (  
And the growing process is far more dangerous and challenging than for a human , between shortages of food , intense competition , learning to fly and hunt , and having to find a nesting place ( so as not to overlap with one 's own parents ) . And nature is unforgiving . Though adults may exhaust themselves trying to feed the chicks , it often happens that not one is alive by the time it comes to leaving the nest .  
" The lonely eagle : " An eagle is circling / The wind along the high ridge inspiring its wings / Those days just before you left / You seemed evasive , restless / So like a gaunt eagle anxious to fly / . . . " - Chen Yi-chih . Accompanying human history over thousands of years , the birds of prey have never been tamed . Their genes know no code for " obedience " or " companionship . "  
This is why many people take the view that just at the basic spirit behind the children 's welfare law is that children have self-esteem and need to be respected by adults , wild animals involved in the workings of human society also need people to fight for their most basic right " not to be subjected to mental terror or physical abuse , " in the same way that disadvantaged groups in society are protected .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
Thus fate in Buddhism refers to action resulting from outer circumstances and to acting in accordance with one 's situation . People have to exist in the world of an unceasing cycle of creation and destruction , and it is only if one understands how to " go with life 's flow , " to face the illusory nature of human life , to be at peace with whatever fortune brings , and neither to hold tight nor cast away , that one can be contented in this inconstant world .  
It 's the place which bore and suckled us . . . we are bound to her not only by understanding , but also by life and emotion . . . no matter how her lofty mountains and sparkling waters may be despoiled , her deep human intimacy diluted , as long as we live on this island of Taiwan , she will always be home to our spirits , " Su Wen-kui , editor of the periodical Hu Wei Chieh wrote in an article .  
In another article , Huang Jui-mao has observed : " A city is an artificial environment created by human beings over time , imbued with collective emotions accumulated over long periods of the human struggle for existence , and expressed in a real spatial environment through the concerns and practical operation of a specific culture .  
When Lin Chung-cheng , an Academia Sinica researcher in social sciences , examined the early economic differences between native Taiwanese and mainlanders , he discovered that native businesses tended to take root among the general public and situate themselves in downstream manufacturing , while mainlander businesses were mostly developing upstream supply industries which could avoid the market weakness of insufficient human resources .  
Dr . Chen felt that apart from doctoring from morning till night , he should have the ability to do something else , so he decided to practice the flute with its complex fingering , for " it helps develop one 's mental capacity . " Dr . Chen says humorously that human beings have around 50 billion brain cells , but most people only use a fifth or a quarter of them throughout their lives ; the rest are left completely unused , which is a real pity .

The main motive why Master Hsiao Yun , who has worked as a university professor in the past , decided to found a university was to develop students " who will truly be able to use technology to improve the human condition . " Master Cheng Yan set up the Tzu Chi nursing and medical schools to upgrade medical resources in eastern Taiwan , and to cultivate " beneficent doctors " with a spirit of compassion in an effort to help solve the problem of young girls in eastern Taiwan who have neither education nor employment .  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
She believes that MSG 's principal ingredient , glutamic acid , is not irreplaceable . " The human body can automatically produce this compound or naturally absorb it from fruits and vegetables . That is sufficient , " she says . It is more intelligent to keep MSG , like table salt , at arm 's length . "  
Under the azure sky of a summer day , in the muddy footpaths between the pea fields , there are little groups of human figures , wearing conical farmer 's hats and dressed in colorful patterned shirts , busily moving their hands up and down . Walk in for a closer look , and you see that all of them are women of at least 50 or 60 years old with weathered and wrinkled faces ; there are only a few men scattered here and there among them .  
Right now the mainland economy is heated up , and the financial market has the jitters . Of course private companies ca n't compete with state-owned enterprises which have access to deep and extensive human relations networks , " Yang Donghong observes . If a state-owned establishment defaults on a loan , the loan officer holds little responsibility . But if a private business goes insolvent , the officer who sponsored the loan will almost certainly be unable to escape blame .  
There can be few among the travellers hurrying north or south along the section of the freeway between Tai-an and Sanyi who are not struck by the sudden appearance of this desolate , barren scenery where plain meets plateau , as they pass by the Taan River and Huoyan Mountains . As far as the eye can see , there is no sign of human activity , apart from the matchbox-like gravel trucks on the river embankments .  
For instance , some factories only carve all kinds of Bodhidarma figures , while others specialize in human figures , or birds and animals , and so on . " Collective creation on a production line " is also a widespread method . To take a religious statue as an example , after the rough wooden blank has been cut out , the carving of its face , hands , curves and background , the application of gold leaf and other operations are all the responsibility of different specialists .  
Kang Mu-hsiang , who applies sculptural concepts in his carving , attracts customers to his studio with a large picture of himself holding a chisel and a gouge . Tseng Chin-tsai 's sign uses the theme of a swineherd in the old agricultural society and the song " When Will You Return ? " to allude to the inevitability of suffering in human life . Here one can also find pottery studios , a studio producing mainly carvings of horses , and so on . All the color of Sanyi is concentrated in this one short street .  
Part of her " Series on Man " was the award-winning work " The Ladder , " in which half-abstract human figures were folded and shaped on a ceramic plate , trampling and pushing each other , struggling to climb up a rotten old ladder . If the clay people were careless , they fell off and were smashed to bits .  
Professor B . J . Habibie , Indonesia 's State Minister for Research and Technology , has said publicly : " At some stage Singapore , with its limited natural and human resources but rapid economic growth , is certain to reach a critical pressure , just like a balloon ; and Batam , 20km south of Singapore , is ready to catch the balloon which will be squeezed out of Singapore 's balloon . "  
The explanation is very simple : the ancients gathered their knowledge completely from nature ; they inferred a direct relation between the waxing and waning of the natural world and the birth and death of every human being . When would the fish swim up to the water 's surface through the broken ice ? When would the swallows arrive ? When would the crops bloom and wither ?  
Just as Sun Ta-chuan , secretary-general of the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples ' Cultural Association has said , many Han Chinese have begun to realize that the everyday wisdom inherent in aboriginal culture includes important human factors which have long been lost from their own lives . Such " two-way " thinking is gradually growing into a sound and mutually adaptive interethni relationship .  
On March 26 , 1988 , more than 200 brook masu salmon fry , each of them tagged for identification , prepared to leave the propagation center built for them by human beings and set out to return " home " - - to the Chichiawan Stream at Lishan in central Taiwan .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
With regard to this , some scholars early on suggested that medical histories , being a precious medical resource and crucial to human life , should be transferred along with the person , and should not be locked within the hospital . Ideal as this suggestion may sound , medical centers maintain the hesitant mentality of " if personal medical history is really opened up , wo n't there be endless medical controversies ? "  
At the side of a cliff , a group of bright red sea fans shake with the current , and a school of light green , light purple , and light red anthids float by . Menacing lionfish , covered with what seem to be thorns and claws , swim along face down . Upon seeing human divers - - what strange creatures ! - - sea snakes swim by and touch their flippers . . . .  
The decoration was no longer set off in panels , but composed in continuous scenes on the body of the pieces , and included landscapes with buildings and human characters , and narrative scenes from novels and plays . The designs stressed their Chineseness , and were tailored to the tastes of European consumers .  
The broad realm of poetryAlthough poetry once again aimed to reach out to people and its language was no longer dark and obscure , it was still less accessible than novels or essays . Chang Shiang-hua states , " Its language is concise and to the point , rich in images . It expresses very well the sense of transience of the phenomena of human life . " At the same time , because schools offered no classes in appreciation of modern poetry , the general public still needed some guidance before it could really accept this work .  
In response to the human culture and natural environment of the Lanyang Plain , Wang Chen-hua incorporated many features often seen in old Ilan houses into the Chung home , such as turtle-shell pattern windows , and openings in walls in the shape of peaches and pomegranates , which symbolize good fortune . To cope with the local climate of fierce sunshine and abundant rainfall , the roofs have very broad eaves . In the central courtyard one can watch the rain and listen to its melody .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
One day she made the mistake of entering the realm of an evil wizard who cast a spell and turned her and her maids into swans . Day after day she led her flock of maid swans in sad wandering through the forest . Only in the deep dark night before dawn did they return to their human forms , and the only way to break the spell was to have a young man show undying love for the princess .  
With many of Taiwan 's wild animals having become " disadvantaged groups " or having even been driven to the verge of extinction by pressure from human development , it became a matter of necessity to pass the Wildlife Conservation Law to protect endemic and rare species . But at the same time , previously unknown species of tree frogs , shrews , bats , spiders and many other animals which , though unfamiliar , enrich the list of Taiwan 's endemic species , have recently been " discovered " in the wild .  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
But Taiwan is a major trading area , and includes the world 's third busiest port ( Kaohsiung ) . Ships come and go 24 hours a day , and there are countless business travelers and tourists . Meanwhile dealers are constantly coming up with new ways to smuggle contraband - - tucked into ship containers , hidden away in luggage , even inserted or swallowed into the human body .  
During the years of the preposterous and unprecedented Cultural Revolution , I finally realized that the difference between Mao Zedong and Karl Marx was that Mao extended the scope of the powerful machinery of the dictatorship of the proletariat from the political and economic sphere into the domain of the human mind .  
When the banner of tyranny over the mind was raised high , all the books containing petals of human warmth were banned , and all the poems acknowledged the world over as the height of truth , goodness and beauty were regarded as poisonous weeds of the feudal and bourgeois classes .  
I just ignorantly followed the tide and shouted the slogans of class struggle . Hence when I was made to bow my head , I could still open my eyes to read this preposterous , realistic book and gain a deep understanding of a wrongful era , and see how it turned the noble human race into a pack of dogs with their heads drawn in and their tails tightly between their legs , pitiful housepets who feared a beating every minute .  
The clock tower 's main structure comprised three levels . The upper level bore an armillary sphere , used for astronomical observations ; on the middle level was a celestial globe , which displayed the movements of celestial bodies ; while on the bottom level were wooden mannikins which struck the time of day . The whole formed " a single mechanism , turned by the power of water , without human effort . "  
But the nearby culture of Qi has gradually been all but forgotten by history . Lu civilization was based on agriculture . Agricultural civilization tends toward the soft , the delicate , the conservative . It stresses ethics , human sentiment , stability , the golden mean and morality .  
Winston Peters ' polemics about Asians have been reported to human rights organizations , and the Race Relations Office has not only expressed " concern , " but even published a full-page advertisement picturing four brains , of which three , of equal size , were labelled " Pakeha , " " Maori " and " Asian , " while the fourth , much smaller brain was labelled " Racist . "  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
She continued to explain that the six holes in the shoes that monks and nuns wear represent planting one 's feet on solid ground , and seeing through the vanity of human desires . Their clothing varies according to region . For convenience , some wear long frocks ; others wear robes that leave the right shoulder bare , demonstrating sincerity . There are also special rules for getting dressed : Keep your whole body erect and look straight ahead ; only your hands can move .  
The electricity runs through the circuits like the transmitting material in the human nervous system , which allows the brain to remember , select , calculate , and even listen , speak , read , and write , undertaking all kinds of " intelligent " tasks . The applications of the flow of electric current in a circuit are virtually limitless :  
One of the more extreme examples often cited is that of the nearby Philippines , where university education is very common . Nevertheless , even the Filipina maids who come to work in Taiwan have university diplomas , thus wasting the talented manpower of that nation . How should the quality of human labor be synchronized with economic development ?  
Our ancient ancestors knew only too well how active and vital love can be at its most primitive , so it is hardly surprising if they regarded it as a raging flood or wild beast , and tried to " preserve Heaven 's order by eliminating human desire . "  
Are n't the ' gifted scholars and fine ladies ' of the book simply versions of today 's young ' dudes and babes ? ' " The Chinese notion of predestiny in human relations originated because there was only limited opportunity for meeting partners in olden times , but waiting for a predestined match these days-waiting passively for someone to catch you-is unhealthy and ' fatalistic ! '  
The female prosecutors tend to be a bit more cautious in these matters , paying careful attention to legal and procedural demands . Although this is only proper in respecting human rights , still the police often feel frustrated as a result .  
Many people were taken by their parents deep into the mountains to be tattooed in secret . The preconditions for having tattoos were gradually relaxed . Males no longer had to have hunted a human head , and females no longer had to be able to weave . The age at which facial tattooing occurred was also moved forward ; many children and adolescents had facial tattoos early , according to their parents ' wishes .  
Aside from the direct economic loss to the human race of the trees as a source of timber , many people believe that if large numbers of Taiwan red pine exit Taiwan 's biological stage , it would be overoptimistic to think that in many areas of rugged terrain where native pines now grow , the original vegetation could be restored by voluntary tree planting campaigns .  
Far from his native place , Su looked back on his frustrated career and felt he had spent 30 years in a dream of illusory glory . On awakening he now found himself mired in the mud of human politics , his future uncertain . He felt like a fish caught on a hook , unable to swim up or down .  
Compared with the lonely pines standing among great mountains and ageless rivers , the material aspirations of the human world are transitory and fleeting . As life and history pass , even the greatest sorrows will be wiped away . When we humans see how nature is unconcerned at our troubles , our own mood in the face of adversity or disaster may be calmed : what is owned may be lost , and the present may pass-one need only seek compensation in one 's own soul .  
A stone altar is decorated with the figure of a priest , sitting cross-legged and wearing an ornate headdress ; his head stands out in sharp relief . But what is the most astonishing of all is surely the several colossal human heads carved out of granite , each of them around two meters high and weighing up to twenty tons .  
This exhibit , known as Offering No . 4 , was found at La Venta in 1955 , and comprises 15 human figures about six inches tall , carved from jade or serpentine , and arranged in a half-circle facing a figure carved from red sandstone . Behind the red figure are six jade " celts " ( polished , chisel-shaped implements ) , on which incised symbols or writing are faintly discernible .  
Ann Philips , a retired professor from the Spanish department at the University of Central Oklahoma , cited the example of how the Maya script was deciphered : for many years researchers could only puzzle over those exquisite human figures and other images , but could not interpret them ; in the end it was an " amateur " - the painter Linda Schele-who interpreted the script from the content of the images themselves , and thus solved many mysteries about the history of Mayan dynastic succession .  
In the end , Lin has selected and weighed the most absolutely central , canonical materials from history , taking into consideration every kind of musical genre and aspect of living concern , as in the typical emotions in human social life , praise of nature , the careful observation of transformations in space and time , various interesting features of everyday living , the fundamental pulse of life , and so forth , and in this way has gradually expanded the collection to 67 musical pieces .  
Liao , an assistant professor of literary history at National Chung Cheng University , thinks that some of the Chinese literati were softer , warmer , and more sensitive . These writers admired the naturalness and purity of children , and so often used children to give allegorical expression to these feelings , contrasting these traits with the ambiguous nature of human affairs . They allowed themselves to take comfort in the naivet * and guilelessness of children .  
Although its strivings have produced no small number of impressive works , many of the generation 's artists have yet to come completely into their prime-particularly in regard to manifesting the " full human potential " sought by traditional literati ink painting . Many of the most famous painters were 80 to 90 years old before attaining a level of maturity that allowed them to express their deepest sentiments in their work at will .  
While evaluating plans for ROCSAT-2 , the group decided that because synchronous satellites are vastly more complex than low-orbit satellites , and because it would be difficult to redirect the technical and human resources which were being built up through the ROCSAT-1 project , ROCSAT-2 would be redesignated as a low-orbit satellite .  
When the floodgates were later opened , the floodwater receded within half-an-hour , leaving behind a thick layer of mud and incalculable damage . Afterwards , as Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian was on vacation overseas , Deputy Mayor Lin Chia-cheng made a statement which asserted that human error had been involved in the Tahu flood . Bureau of Public Works Director Hsu Jui-feng has agreed to take the blame for this incident , and Office of City Parks &amp; Street Lights Director Chang Ching , as well as five of his subordinates , have received demerits .  
It 's just that state firms often are less efficient than private ones because they have three burdens to bear : implementing state policies based on non-economic concerns , accepting legal restraints and interference from government agencies , and the human failing of usually performing public tasks more poorly than those involving private profit . Thus people often are dismayed with state firms .  
With IVF , the surrogate mother need not have any direct physical contact with the prospective father . Yet although this might appear more in keeping with " human dignity " and " moral values , " it is precisely this artificial approach of " only wanting a child and not wanting sex , " which many people find suspect about the whole procedure .  
Whether or not legislation is passed , perhaps in the end it will still be a matter for individual choice and conscience , and the new issues created by modern technological " solutions " by which humans seek to " overcome nature , " such as human cloning , cryogenics and so on , will continue to constantly force mankind to search for still more comprehensive and precisely formulated social rules , and will forever push " evolution " to new heights .  
Huang feels that stories designed to make a moral point are oversimplified , and real life is much more complicated . What he likes is to capture human nature , as in the Chinese opera classic The Fourth Son Visiting His Mother , which retains its emotional impact today because the son is torn between family and country , wife and mother .  
Fa Chih-pin , a professor of law at Chengchih University , points out that early on most countries included slander and libel in criminal law . After World War II , with strengthened calls from international organizations to protect human rights , the problems of finding people guilty for slander and libel under criminal law gradually began to become apparent . " The major difference between criminal and civil law is that people can be locked up under criminal law , and when people are in jail they clearly do n't have freedom to speak and publish . "  
Chen Shu says that as an agent , of course he wants to make sure all the paperwork proceeds smoothly , and yet the required paperwork for fishing vessels to enter and exit the harbor is very complicated . Argentina is very strict on safety , as strict as any developed country . It requires stringent guards against environmental pollution-oil can not be poured directly into the sea , and there must be oil and water filtering mechanisms , chemical treatment of human waste , foot activation devices for washing hands , and so on .  
He also cites the example of the German software company SAP , which has risen to prominence in recent years . He explains that the company has tapped into the demand created by businesses ' need to restructure , by designing integrated software for human resource management , financial management , accounting and materials management . SAP has become the global leader in software for " enterprise resource planning , " with an annual turnover of US $ 4 billion .  
" The purpose of technology is to serve human cultural development , and the world has already reached a stage in which intangible assets are the most valued and the most valuable , " said Acer Group chairman and CEO Stan Shih at a press conference , adding that the main reason why software is so expensive in Taiwan is because of the small size of the local market .  
Of course , there is much in these " new age " books that looks ridiculous , that is mere wishful thinking , or that is just opinion . But they make apparent the great desire of human beings to seek truth , goodness , and knowledge . People have always been dissatisfied with , dubious about , or willing to challenge actual experience , and have sought a better world .  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
In particular , Daoists ' choice of places to identify as fairy grottoes , apart from being suitable places to refine elixirs in the hope of transcending death , also responded to the mood of the times and to practical needs . Hence rich , fertile soil suitable for growing rice , and locations out of reach of natural disasters and human wars and turmoil , became essential requirements for the blessed abodes .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
The most novel interpretation of the tales of love between immortals and regular human beings appears in a book published in Taiwan , in which the author argues that the denizens of heaven are sapped of their sex drive by perpetually fair weather , beautiful clothing , delectable food , and centuries of living at a metabolic rate of zero .  
" Having aboriginal people , who have always been the subjects of anthropological study , operating the camera themselves is a revolution in the history of documentary film making , " exclaims Wang . It is of course a separate issue whether or not documentaries based on their own subjective points of view will be " better , " but from a human rights point of view , granting the subjects of research the right to speak for themselves is definitely to be encouraged .  
He met the subject of the piece , Li Jung-lin , nine years previously when Li handled the funeral of his mother . But it was only two years ago , when Lin 's mother 's grave was robbed , and Li , wearing a gas mask , personally went into the grave to repair the damage to the coffin , that Lin really came to understand this man . He discovered that Li has quite remarkable views on death , human dignity , and on the poor self-regulation of the funeral industry .  
In an attempt to rein in this flaw in human character , some legislators and members of medical associations who recognized the potential problem proposed measures to seal loopholes in the system . The measures proposed included one under which NHI would only have paid for hospital stays , not minor illnesses , and another which would have required patients to pay the cost differential created when they go to a major hospital to treat a minor problem . However , neither of these proposals were accepted .  
Although investigation of the relationship between climate and infectious diseases is still at a preliminary stage , excessive human development of jungles and rainforests has increased people 's chances of coming into contact with the microorganisms which live there , and with their natural hosts .  
Chen Hao-yung of the NIPM says that once a virus develops into an urban virus it becomes very hard to eradicate . Viruses are very simple in structure , and as long as they have live cells to act as their hosts they can continue to reproduce . Hence cities , which have dense human populations and also harbor large numbers of rodents and other pests , are perfect breeding grounds for viruses .  
" We ca n't know if this was right or not , " admits Wu Tsung-neng . No one knows if the slowing of the epidemic was due to human effort or was a natural trend . However , from the fact that over the same time period other communicable diseases also were reduced , it can be assumed that the preventive measures taken against the enterovirus were effective .  
But with something as marvelously complex as the human body , there are always eventualities that can not be predicted in a living will . For instance , when a patient falls into a deep coma as a result of a stroke , the brain stem that controls cardiopulmonary functions may become completely unresponsive ( resulting in brain death ) . In such circumstances , a patient could die in a few minutes or might survive for two weeks , but death is assured .  
Not only in the realm of medical care , but also in the laboratory and in clinical research , researchers are investigating traditional medicines in the hope of striking gold . Their ambition is to find more effective ways to deal with the many hard-to-treat illnesses which currently afflict human beings . The more optimistic among them predict that integration of TCM and Western medicine will become part of the mainstream of medical care in the 21st century .  
In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Research has revealed that human metabolic processes produce something known as a " free radical . " These free radicals cause a kind of oxidation which damages normal cells and weakens the body 's immune response . This can lead to illness , aging and even death . Free radicals have also been implicated as a possible cause of cancer .  
" People 's lives were wasted when they were imprisoned for many years here because of their beliefs and political views , " said Premier Vincent Siew , who spoke as master of ceremonies at the monument 's ground-breaking . " In truth , freedom of belief is a God-given right , and no one should be imprisoned for political reasons . " Past history shows us , Siew noted , that human wisdom is often distorted by mistaken judgment , with deep regrets later .  
" In traditional Chinese thinking there were human rights , there just was n't the term for them , " says Chai Sung-lin , chairman of the Chinese Human Rights Association . Apart from the support for human rights expressed in pre-Qin thought , when Liu Bang ruled at the end of the Qin , he and the elders mandated in law that those who killed would die themselves , and those who injured and robbed would be punished . " This provided a legal basis for protecting people 's rights to life and property . "  
In A Comparison of Chinese and Western Conceptions of Human Rights , the legal scholar Chang Yi-ting holds that Chinese society uses the power of ethics and morality to create a harmonious society . This is an exalted ideal of Confucianism and is also a major reason why there is no record of Chinese in ancient times fighting for human rights .  
For being and nonbeing give rise to each other , difficulty and ease complete each other , long and short reveal each other . . . . " This too displays Laozi 's characteristic way of thinking : everything in the manifest world comes in relative and complementary pairs , and human value judgements are mostly born of relativity .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets . But in fact , when the interests of pets or of animals raised as food or for medical research conflict with those of humans , people often fail to consider their physical and mental well-being .  
There is no parallel in human history for the bronze-making culture that flourished in China over 3,000 years ago . Particularly noteworthy are the bronzes that have been unearthed at Anyang in the Yellow River basin . The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
And taiji means " the natural way " - standing erect and centered , being impartial and unbiased , neither lacking nor in excess , adhering to one position-in other words the way of the natural world , and the way of the human being . Or in short : moral cultivation , the very purpose of human life .  
The importance of the human factor can not be overlooked . No matter how sophisticated forensic techniques are , and no matter how advanced scientific instruments may become , the key to success will always be how well the practitioner makes use of his tools . The core elements of scientific criminal investigation are broad knowledge , finely honed powers of observation , and a combination of bold imagination and cautious search for proof .  
ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry . It is a constant motivating force for democratic political development . In the future , the ROC will continue to practically implement and fully realize such essential components of civilization as democracy , freedom and human rights , striving in concert with others to achieve the goal of global press freedom .  
" If it had n't been for the Formosa Plastics mercury waste incident in Cambodia , who knows how long the chaos in Taiwan 's management , storage and disposal of hazardous industrial wastes would have continued , along with the tremendous threat it poses to human health and the environment ? " asks Professor Lin Cheng-fang of National Taiwan University 's Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering , giving FPG some backhanded credit for highlighting the issue .  
As " artistic supervisor of character design , " Chang set about crafting the overall style of Mulan , and he discovered an element from classical Chinese painting that proved useful in animation-the " gossamer sketching " method of delineating human figures . In particular , the curving lines that form the hands of Buddhist deities , giving the effect of floating clouds or flowing water , became the artistic basis for the film 's character design .  
At the tenth anniversary of Tiananmen , preventive measures by the mainland authorities made substantive attacks against the government impossible . But participants in a symposium on " The May Fourth Movement and 20th-Century China " at Peking University in early May could scarcely fail to expand on the stated theme , to touch on the currently most sensitive topics of democracy , human rights and freedom which were the issues behind Tiananmen . Hence the symposium was full of the sense that " all history is contemporary history . "  
In fact , American China policy has maintained a general direction based on three main national interests : democracy and human rights , economics and trade , and security and military strategy . The periodic swinging results from a tug of war between two groups of US domestic forces , one more accomodating toward Beijing such as the mainstream China scholars , the other more critical , such as the media . Nevertheless , Taipei seeks simultaneous improvement of relations with both Washington and Beijing .  
Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry . But innovation requires huge quantities of financial and human resources dedicated to R &amp; D , with laboratories pursuing technological breakthroughs around the clock , and with professional investment managers able to turn innovative ideas into products and profits . "  
Recently he has introduced the United Nations ' newest perspectives on human rights . Nevertheless , Chai , whose head of white hair reveals his years , admits he feels that society is changing too fast . " Everyone is groping in the dark as we face new situations . We do n't have any kind of life experience that 's worth being proud of , that we can pass on to the next generation . "  
People have long criticized Chinese society for putting more emphasis on human relationships than on written codes . But many people do not know that during the Han dynasty , China had a comprehensive set of laws that was every bit as impressive as the renowned imperial Roman civil code .  
Ko 's own attitude towards the Song dynasty is a mixture of love and hate . Those deeply introspective literary types with their lofty moral standards produced artistic achievements of the highest order . Yet they also seemed " over-civilized , " devoid of any streak of wildness , as if lacking part of what makes us human .  
Assistance also comes from locals who have long been active in the labor and human rights movements , such as Yvonne Lin , who for nearly ten years has helped foreign laborers stuck in detention centers to get back to their home countries . Lin says that caring for the lives of working people is a cause that transcends nationality , and that disputes between overseas workers and their employers often simply highlight problems already faced by Taiwanese workers . Tackling such problems can help to pave the way for improved rights all round .  
Stroking the silver-gray ringlets which are twice as fine as human hair , Chang says that these soft , flexible fibers of high-grade steel can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but-thanks to metals ' outstanding capacity to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and their ability to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments-they also have a wide range of applications in many industries .  
In the early years of ROC rule in Taiwan , the government sent political prisoners to Green Island . Those inmates lucky enough to survive that era of oppression and return to their normal lives , as well as family members of prisoners and other citizens concerned about human rights , joined together to create the foundation . So that the suffering of that period would not be forgotten , they raised money to establish this memorial , which bears witness to the government 's past mistakes and the pain of those who suffered under its oppression .  
" Building on this foundation , we will continue striving to protect this resource . Human rights are dependent on more than merely political and legal struggle . Rather , they involve independent thinking and respect for people as individuals . We 've got to take our conception of human rights and make it an integral part of people 's basic moral fiber , so that it is fully manifested in everyday life . "  
At the end of every year it issues its " indices of human rights in Taiwan . " The association 's Chai Song-lin says that this year Taiwan earned failing marks in all eight categories of human rights : political , children 's , elderly , economic , judicial , educational-cultural , social and women 's rights .  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit . Lien 's " third wave of reform " has six major objectives , including achievement of " clean and competent government , " " a justice system dedicated to true justice , " " a greater role for the national legislature and an overhaul of the National Assembly , " and " the preservation of basic human rights . "  
As such , he proposes that both Taiwan and the mainland issue a yearly white paper on human rights to review fishing disputes , cross-strait marriage and residency , and other human rights issues generated by contact between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait . The ultimate objective in so doing would be to build up mutual trust by encouraging real interaction at the personal level .  
West Lake in Hangzhou is n't famous just for its beauty , but also for the fact that it was there that Xu Xian met his star-crossed lover , the beautiful Bai Niang-niang ( a snake spirit who took a fancy to Xu and changed into human form to marry him ) . Writers have penned moving descriptions of their love story , and no Chinese can visit the lake without thinking of the fabled romance between man and enchantress .  
I have always remembered the encouragement which Mr . Yu Youren gave me as a young reporter . He said that to be a fearless champion of social justice , as is expected of a journalist , the most important thing , apart from energy and vitality , is modesty . You have to treat everybody the same , and not be overawed by the great and powerful . A president or a street sweeper deserve the same respect as a human being , and should both be treated the same way .  
All of these developments will have a huge impact on the future well-being of the human race , yet for many of us they are distant and unfamiliar . This is particularly true of genetic engineering , considered the biggest breakthrough in the life sciences since genetics and molecular biology . Man has begun to probe the very origins of life .  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
It involves eighteen countries , headed by the US , the UK , Japan , Germany , France and mainland China . The project was originally scheduled for completion in 2005 , but intense competition from a privately owned gene-sequencing company , Celera Genomics , spurred the multinational team to bring forward its timetable , and a full , precise map of the human genome is now expected before 2003 .  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
According to Chang Sung-jen , an art critic who acts as Ju Ming 's agent , " Tai ji quan involves a force that is from beyond the realm of ordinary human experience , and art that focuses on this subject could very nearly be categorized as religious art . The people motif , on the other hand , is about the commonplace . " To deal with the subject of tai ji quan takes boldness and vigor , while sculpting people requires great attention to detail and very good technical skill .  
In contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , Annette Lu has emphasized " soft national power . " Before her departure she stated that Taiwan advocates human rights , democracy , high-technology , compassion , and peace . If Taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such " soft power , " one day the United Nations will turn around and want Taiwan to join .  
Chen Ai-ni , an expert on gender and marriage , says that emphasizing human rights in marriage is not meant to put one 's spouse " on warning " or to make divorce more fair . Rather it is to preserve marriage and secure the foundations of happiness between husband and wife . Chen believes that it can effectively deter physical and psychological domestic violence , which would be the first step in " happiness engineering . "  
Quoting Bo Yang , Chen said , " For all the mistakes and abuses committed in the past , we can be understanding , tolerant and forgiving , but we can never forget-because those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it . " In response to human rights problems , Chen said that every nation must work to raise awareness and education , uphold international standards , and create legal mechanisms for promoting and protecting human rights .  
The case has elicited the concern of human rights groups around the world . The London headquarters of Amnesty International , which describes the convictions as " the judicial ruling of an uncivilized nation , " has organized several support campaigns for the three men , and last May sent representatives to Taiwan , where they called a press conference and stated , " If Taiwan 's government intends to make human rights a trump card of its foreign policy , it should first grant clemency to the Hsichih trio . "  
This independent film festival , which aimed to present the Amis ' own world view , brought together 14 films by four Amis directors and one Japanese director . The organizers attempted to cast off impressions of the aboriginal peoples based on a mishmash of cultural cliches , and also hoped that the festival and its accompanying seminars , concert and gourmet buffet would help city people understand the true " Pangcah . " " Pangcah " is the Amis word for " human being , " and also the term by which the Amis refer to themselves .  
" It is estimated that the pool of human knowledge doubled once every fifty years in the 19th century , and about once every ten years in the 20th century . Now it doubles once every three to five years , " notes Wu Se-hwa , dean of the business school at National Chengchi University . The explosive growth of information is the most distinctive feature of the 20th century , and has brought sweeping changes to the world 's political , social , and economic structure .  
For most of history , the limited powers of our unaided senses left humans blissfully unaware of the micro-organisms all around us . But the development of optical instruments gradually lifted the veil from that hidden world , so that human ideas about life had to be constantly revised .  
He became aware of how vastly different the Buddhist carvings in the Yungang Grottoes were to ancient Greek sculptures : the East emphasized tranquillity , capturing the essence , whereas the West stressed unrestrained energy and realistic depiction . Western figurative art considered the human body as a geometric form , an approach which culminated in the cubism of Picasso , whereas the Wei and Jin carvings of the Buddha give the human figure a sense of life and their forms embody and evoke a sense of more of life 's elements .  
" Being involved in a social movement taught me that , at their core , most social problems come down to the fundamental character of human beings . So having been part of an organized movement , having worked within a group , I 've gone back to the beginning and am looking at myself . " Even as a child , Chen was introspective and given to challenging anything she perceived as unfair .  
As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
In the reign of emperor Han Wu Di ( 141-87 BC ) , Dong Zhongshu tried to use catastrophes to hold the emperor in check and prevent excessive concentration of political power in his hands . He argued that unusual heavenly events portended major changes in the course of human affairs , and championed the idea that one could predict the future by observing the stars .  
In fact , in any land and age , the human longing for a sense of security is likely to keep popular belief in astrology alive and kicking . But with the extremely high-powered telescopes that are trained on the skies today , heavenly bodies are no longer veiled in secrecy . One question that Chinese astronomers might do well to address is how to resurrect ancient Chinese astronomy and make it into more than just a quaint source of astro-babble among people wondering which zodiac signs make for a romantic match .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
The GalaxyChip design involves cutting up a traditional polymer chip , around one square centimeter in size , into tens of thousands of much smaller chips only 100 microns across-a tenth of the thickness of a human hair . These tiny chips are " as numerous as stars in the sky " - hence the name GalaxyChip .  
Lo Liu-chih points out that the collared bush robins that live on the ground in the forest understory mainly nest on grassy slopes , where as well as being exposed to major airborne predators such as raptors and crows , they are also apt to attract the attention of land animals such as weasels and rock monkeys . " Large creatures like weasels , birds of prey or nutcrackers may be more sensitive to traffic , and more easily frightened by human activity , " says Lo Liu-chih .  
In May 2000 a peaceful transfer of power was accomplished for the first time in Chinese history when the Democratic Progressive Party 's Chen Shui-bian took over as president of the Republic of China . In his inaugural address , he stressed that the country was founded based on respect for human rights . Then in October of that year he formally established an advisory committee on human rights chaired by Vice President Annette Lu .  
Third - and fourth-year elementary school pupils are expected to master some 30 defined skills in social studies , including the abilities to " describe the lifestyles of people in different regions , " " survey the distribution of and changes in the population of their home area , " and " recognize that the formation of a settlement is a response to the human need for communal living . "  
First , while average global temperature is rising , warming occurs at different rates and in differing degrees depending upon location . For example , the large " body " of the ocean is similar to that of an adult human in that it does n't easily become " feverish . " Land , on the other hand , more closely resembles a small child that catches a fever at the mere mention of the word .  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
Two years back Taiwan experienced a major earthquake . Last year there were landslides and massive flooding here , and also the horrific 911 incident in New York . And most recently Taiwan has faced a drought . Some of these are natural disasters , some are man-made , and some are natural disasters made worse by human action .  
In addition , Taiwan 's background as a former Japanese colony and the many Taiwanese who have studied and worked in the US give the island a human network of international dimensions . Add in the fact that the island shares a common language and culture with China and with ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia , and the tight ties between its own business , political and academic circles , and Taiwan looks to be very well positioned here at the beginning of the era of globalization .  
To date , the DCB has acquired four new technologies with medical applications , including a platform to generate human monoclonal antibodies against entrovirus type 71 , and drugs with the potential to treat complications resulting from chronic heart failure and diabetes . The center is also beginning to get its hands on very promising technologies used to modify genes and proteins . It 's who you know  
In the novel , humans have long since created intelligent computers , the Earth is in the complete control of a cosmic computer alliance , all material needs are met , the genetic codes of all organisms have been fully decoded , the human dream of eternal youth has been realized , and humans can acquire all kinds of knowledge at any time through the network communication systems that they carry with them .  
Chu Bong-foo says he first conceived Cosmic Drifter in 1998 . The ideas came from his previously published Nine Essays On Intelligence , in which he discusses thought , human nature and value in terms of energy conversion , the formation of matter , the nature of time and space , and the evolution of the universe . But the essays ' content was dry and dull , and nobody understood it . Therefore he wanted to turn his theories into a popular novel that ordinary people would understand .  
Hsu Tzu-you , who has helped terminal cancer patients employing Chinese and Western folk medicine , has in recent years been a forceful proponent of preventative medicine . He states that the human body is a thing of marvel and mystery , explaining how the sympathetic nerve and the parasympathetic nerve help each other obtain balance . But now that people live very sedentary lives , they are constantly exercising their brains but little else .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
But World Heritage Sites are rightfully the collective inheritance of the human race , regardless of where they happen to be located . If they meet the criteria for World Heritage Sites , then they should be designated as such . As members of the global village , we need to protect these precious assets and pass them on to future generations .  
The false cypress forests which bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing Taiwan 's fragmented earth , also form a safety valve for the Shihmen Reservoir , Tanshui River and Lanyang River on which the people of northern Taiwan depend for their drinking water . The band of cypress forest that runs from Mt . Chilan to Mt . Lala forms a huge natural reservoir that soaks up heavy rainfall and releases it in gentler flows while keeping the soil firmly in its grasp , in a way that no human engineering project could replicate .  
After millions of years of wind and sea erosion , many of the pillars on the basalt islands have been worn down and are now covered with mud . More recently , human activity has made it difficult to distinguish what is so interesting about these basalt islands . Only by approaching cliffs near the edge of the sea or visiting uninhabited peripheral islands can one clearly see the basalt columns with their vertical fractures running from top to bottom .  
In order to protect Penghu 's precious basalt formations , as well as the countless sea birds that pass by here , in 1993 the Council of Agriculture , acting on suggestions from academics , declared a group of islands in the southeast part of Penghu which rarely see human activity to be the Penghu Columnar Basalt Nature Preserve . The basalt islands , like black pearls across the Western Pacific , are glittering assets of the common heritage of mankind .  
Unlike the austere limestone topology surrounding Mayan settlements in Mexico , many of the Mayan remains in Guatemala are buried within lush tropical forests . Mayan culture fused human culture with the natural environment , achieving tremendous prosperity that can be seen today in the remains of colossal pyramids , temples , sport arenas , and in the network of roads that connected them all . These achievements reflect the golden age of Mayan Culture .  
Chung Chiao , head of a drama company and also a judge for the poetry competition , analyzes the poems in terms of content : The Filipino poems subtly reveal the fervent culture of a tropical island colonized by the Spanish , a poetry filled with love of life and more socially conscious , because of the Filipino tradition of fighting for their rights ; Indonesian works tend to emphasize the micro details of human relationships , while the Vietnamese and Thai poems contain more advice and aphorisms .  
Chang Shiang-hua , who played a leading role in the translation of these poems , points out : " No matter how much difference there may be in political , military , or economic values , no matter how much competition or even conflict there maybe , basic human nature can still in many respects be recorded in poetry , and convey the beauty and the purity of heart .  
" It takes miniscule amounts of environmental hormones to cause harm , and there are no obvious side-effects in the short term . More research is still needed to confirm the connection with human reproductive disorders . As a result , people are apt to treat this issue lightly . " Wang Cheng-hsung worries that while guarding against more obvious risks , people will be complacent about these subtler dangers .  
Taumi is located about five kilometers southwest of Puli Township , at the entrance to Sun Moon Lake . It borders University Pond , a 400-hectare body of water where lilies grow in abundance . National Chi Nan University is located here , and the town has the appealing nickname of " doctorate village " among folks in Nantou County . In sum , it enjoys an outstanding geographic position and excellent human and cultural resources .  
Instead she committed herself to the struggle for freedom , human rights and democracy . After the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident , she supported her husband Chen Shui-bian in embarking on a political career ; a decade later , when Chen was arrested , she won election to the legislature . She later helped her husband to victory in the 2000 presidential elections . Wu had shown an abiding commitment to democratic reform , and had earned a special place in the history of Taiwan 's democratization .  
Because the digital economy is the trend , and it affects all elements of national economic growth-investment behavior , productivity , human resources , currency policy , inflation-and these are things that businesses can not control ( or even understand ) , especially in this murky era when the rules of the game are unclear , the role played by the government is critical .  
It seems clear that in the future , once technologies such as streaming media , wireless networking , digital TV and broadband transmission have matured , all human activities will be able to be satisfied in the digital world .  
For the September edition of Sinorama , your magazine interviewed me on issues related to the protection of human rights for people of diverse sexual orientations ( including homosexuals , bisexuals and transgender people ) . Perhaps for reasons of space , many controversial points were not covered in detail , so I am now writing to give a little further explanation and to again call on people of vision to press the relevant authorities to quickly draft laws to concretely protect the basic human rights of transgender people .  
The unseen , untouchable realm of nanotech has already captured the imagination of the world . Whether you 're talking about " cellular automata " that patrol inside a human body to keep blood vessels clean or repair damaged cells , or tiny " mosquito " missiles so small that they are undetectable by radar , both are nanotech marvels .  
The reason is simple : " Because plants do not grow for us to eat them . " The cell structure of most biological materials is very durable , and not easily broken down . Therefore it is difficult for the matter inside to be released , much less absorbed into the human body .  
One of these university freshmen had a camera , and on the summit he suddenly had a flash of inspiration to combine the majesty of nature with a portrait of the liberated human body . He asked his buddy to pose nude , with his head bent and body leaning at an angle . To get the image he desired , the photographer crouched low .  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
Everyone is connected to their family and the caring between two generations is natural . The givers now will one day receive . This kind of filial piety , which is built around basic feelings of human nature , is not exclusive to Chinese society . Yeh Kuang-hui , who is still researching the topic of filial piety , has lots of friends doing research on this subject in the United States and Australia .  
Why is it that the WHO , which emphasizes pursuing human health across all racial , religious , economic , and social boundaries , is unable to bring Taiwan within its international network ?  
It was for these human rights and medical goals that the international community established the WHO . So when over 190 countries around the world fall under the protective umbrella of WHO , yet the 23 million people of Taiwan are excluded , this is not only unfair to Taiwan , it also represents a weakness in the overall global healthcare structure .  
Getting the injured quickly to medical treatment was the only bright spot in an otherwise tragic day . The accident was caused by simple human error , but some point out that the railway is underfunded and disaster could have struck in other ways . Each year there are 800,000 visitors to the Alishan Forest Recreation Area , which is under the auspices of the Taiwan Forestry Bureau , and every holiday the area is packed with visitors .  
Perhaps the SARS outbreak can remind humankind that regardless of ethnic differences , of how powerful a nation may be , and of whether it stands at the center or on the periphery of world affairs , in the face of a tiny virus the divisions and conflicts of the human world are nothing more than a farce . In the face of the disease , ideological and ethnic differences that are often seen as insurmountable , come to appear insignificant .  
These instruments are not only the main characters in Indian music and dance but are also a principal medium for honoring the gods and entertaining people . And the erotic paintings that cause people to blush at the museum are not only expressions of human carnal desires . They are even better illustrations of the many-layered Indian religious philosophy , which holds that gods rose out of the common human world .  
Eight of the ten largest tourist agencies in Japan manage domestic tourism and depend solely on this market . Japan has managed the tourism industry with amazing skill . This is especially true for the hot springs areas popular with the silver-haired generation , where nature is combined with human artifice , places that can truly be described as " products of culture , " like the famous Hakone and Izu hot springs areas .  
Sadly , widespread planting of betelnut trees , tea plants , and mustard plants has destroyed the old appearance of the forest , and the most famous sight along the route up-the " sacred ancient tree " - was knocked down on July 1 , 1997 . The destruction caused by human activity on Mt . Ali is tragic , but fortunately the railway is holding its own , and many tourists are still thrilled by the " screw-thread " and " zig-zag " sections of the line .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
However , Choice 's main task is the construction of book and magazine centers nationwide ; vital logistical centers like those of Hunan Publishing House and the Beijing Institute of Light Industry are entirely built on the work of Choice , from hardware construction to software and human resource management , all on a solid base of Taiwanese know-how .  
Of course , the war was not in the least affected by the protest . But it is gratifying that on this subject at least there was a broad consensus among local feminist organizations , returning to the basic starting points of the women 's movement : love , peace , justice , and human rights . Perhaps it is by returning to basic humane values that the women 's movement in Taiwan will enjoy a resurgence .  
For example , in order to show the expression on a human face , Wu Ching-fang has used as many as a dozen layers of paper , carefully carved out , in order to create lifelike human eyes , eyelashes and wrinkled skin . When facial expressions are especially complex it is also necessary to use folding , sticking , overlapping , inlaying and pressing techniques to achieve the desired effect .  
To put into practice this ideal of caring for the elderly , Shikatsu-once voted Japan 's best town-has allocated close to 1.5% of its annual budget to the museum and library , and an astonishing amount of human and physical resources have been put into them .  
The changing face of the Yushan area at the hands of human beings over the last hundred years is quite clear . Although since the Japanese occupation Yushan has satisfied the so-called spiritual needs and intellectual inquiries of scholars from various disciplines , this has generally been for the one-sided benefit of mankind , done with a specific purpose in mind . And this includes the so-called " spirit of Yushan " today , which is a product of mankind 's subjective emotional projection .  
The fires continue to flicker ; the world continues to evolve ; and explorers continue to explore , walking endlessly into the vast unknown and shedding light on the mysterious corners of human nature , like a light searching out the real self .  
Lu Ming-fong says , " If we combine genetic research with traditional Chinese medicine we will make the road ahead much shorter . " Traditional Chinese medicine divides the human organism into the five different phases , or constitutions , of metal , wood , water , fire , and earth . Genes also show that different people have different constitutions . For example , it appears that people with cardiovascular diseases rarely get cancer , because heart disease is what Chinese medicine calls a " hot " condition , whereas cancer is a " cold " one .  
The rapid advance of genetic research is giving substance to the medical world 's high hopes for the future . As the function and interactions of our 35,000 genes are analyzed and explained , genetic screening will facilitate effective disease prevention and drug treatment at every step of human development , from the embryonic stage to old age . The age of personalized medicine seems sure to arrive , with all the benefits it will bring .  
In September of last year , Dr . Lin , who had for a long time focused her research on blood groups and ethnic groups , published the results of a study entitled " Correlation between SARS virus infection and the human leukocyte antigen . " Lin concluded that there is a direct connection between the presence of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B46 and the severity of a SARS infection . She found that ethnic southern Chinese who  
Li sets her stories in her hometown of Lukang , here appearing as the city of Lu , about which vengeful female spirits have entrenched themselves , one each to the north , south , east , and west , and another in its center . Their implacability has put them outside of the cycle of life and death-unable to be reborn , they tarry in the human world as ghosts . Over the course of time , these ghosts have participated in and even helped to forge the island 's history .  
Since ancient times , people in the East have for the most part believed that the soul does not perish after death . Egyptians developed mummies , and Taoists in China pursued longevity and deathlessness through alchemy . Even the Buddhists , who viewed the human body as a stinking sack of skin , took bodily incorruptibility as a sign of successful cultivation .  
In contemporary society , life and death have moved from being centered around the family to being handled by professionals , from being something human to becoming something mechanized . People have few opportunities to encounter birth or death , and to plumb the mysteries of life . On the one hand , this unfamiliarity with the basic processes of life frequently results in a nameless fear .  
American medical science began to study the human foot after World War II , when a great many American soldiers who had suffered foot injuries required special medical treatment . The manufacture of orthopedic footwear and auxiliary equipment proved to be particularly troublesome for conventional medicine .  
Lu pointed out that around the globe regional organization is a growing trend , and various continents have given rise to such organizations . Besides the European Union , with its comprehensive political and economic structure , the Organization of American States , the Sistema de la Integracion Centroamericana ( SICA ) , the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , and the African Union have been formed one after another . However , it is a regrettable fact that Asia , where human civilization began , has yet to effectively organize itself .  
" The old idea of saving money for retirement is no longer feasible . Currency can lose value and is really not dependable . Right now people should be spending all their effort at saving up human capital , raising their hireability , so that when a person goes out looking for a job he can actually get hired , " says Hsin Ping-lung . Hireability is based on two factors : good health and lifelong functional learning .  
" Besides the climatic and geographic advantages , this area has a unique background in terms of human history , " states Chen Chung . If hundreds of years ago Chinese had not flooded into Taiwan and occupied all the lowlying land , the Aboriginal peoples would never have been forced to move to high altitudes . When the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 , overnight the island was flooded with two million refugees and soldiers , creating an immediate shortage of arable land , and spawning an urgent need for development in the mountains .  
After a while , the bent of his writing gradually turned towards science fiction , philosophy , and the exploration of the human psyche . A self-proclaimed eclectic , Chang is n't content to stay within established genres , but instead casts a wide literary net that encompasses history , philosophy , movies , and politics .  
however , human rights include not only citizens ' political rights , but also economic , social and cultural rights , he said so far as large numbers of developing countries are concerned , he added , it is the rights to independence , subsistence and development that are of " paramount importance "  
The draft resolution made a statement that " the current international economic order is still unjust , which hinders the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms " The statement was approved following heated discussions  
During his stay here , Li Lanqing and Guinean Foreign Minister Kozo Zoumanigui signed a summary of talks , in which the two sides stressed the traditional friendship and ideal cooperation between the two countries and expressed their identical views on the issues of human rights , taiwan , peace and development  
noting that russia is rich in natural and human resources , li said he believed that the russian people will overcome the temporary difficulties china wishes to see a stable russia with a growing economy , he added  
Annan agreed with Jiang 's view , noting the UN 's make up and work fully embody the diversity of the world The right of subsistence is a basic human right which is equal to political rights The UN , right proceeding from this understanding , has always devoted itself to the world 's economic development , he said  
Shen Guofang said , international peace and security stand as a precondition for the promotion and protection of human rights , adding that without a peaceful and secure environment , no protection can be possibly guaranteed for either civil and political rights or economic , social and cultural rights  
A number of delegations stated that this database on human rights source material should be guided by the principles of indivisibility of all human rights , including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
They stressed that human rights are interrelated and indivisible , comprising civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
To meet the urgent need for increasing human capital and skills , developing countries have continued to allocate to educational services a higher proportion of central government expenditure than have industrial countries .  
In countries where urbanization has taken place at a rapid pace , urban stress affecting human health , particularly that of the urban poor who live in unserviced areas and often make a living from collecting solid wastes , has increased .  
The manual included a detailed summary of the main treaties and organizations relevant to a good understanding of international human rights law and practice .  
They requested additional information on the numerous internal conflicts and ethnic violence and their causes , and concerning the recent suspension of basic guarantees for the enjoyment of fundamental human rights .  
The Committee reaffirmed that those responsible for massive , gross and systematic human rights violations and crimes against international humanitarian law should be held responsible and prosecuted .  
Hence , investing in human capital , improving public administration and basic social services and creating an environment in which the private sector can play an essential role in the economic transformation are of paramount importance .  
For the purposes of advisory services and technical assistance , the term " national institution " is interpreted flexibly to mean any body which is established by a Government to play a central role in the domestic human rights situation .  
Ad hoc expert groups : a meeting will be held on national development experiences and policies with regard to domestic economic management , mobilizing financial and human resources and the roles of the public and private sectors ( 1994 ) .  
Technology is no longer a determinate and static component of manufacturing ; as with human resources , it is a variable in the production process that can be changed , improved and modified through innovative management .  
One of the main endeavours of the least developed countries is to achieve an optimum balance between human needs and the natural resources base in order to maximize their ability to meet these demands on a sustainable basis .  
That is particularly true as those States do not have a shining record in internal or external protection of human rights and do not offer in their own social experience a suitable moral and material environment for the welfare of human beings .  
We regard as inadmissible any violent changes of frontiers as well as " ethnic cleansing " accompanied by massive and flagrant violations of human rights .  
Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms can in no way be reconciled with biased criteria which divide countries into big and small , developed and underdeveloped , majority and minority groups , or along ethnic , racial and religious lines .  
We regret to observe , however , that the spread of conventional arms continues to take on a dangerous magnitude , while at the same time armed conflicts are increasing , causing the tragic loss of numerous innocent human lives .  
" Respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in civil , political , economic , social and cultural matters , as well as democratic values exemplified by free and regular elections ;  
This Cairo Declaration should be regarded as a tributary providing the proper foundation for positive and practical international cooperation and flowing into the main stream of universal support for human rights and freedoms .  
Its recent expansion from 3 to 10 full members makes ECO a major regional grouping and an important international entity with vast combined potential in terms of material and human resources .  
In order to achieve the required level of services , enhanced coordination and technological innovation were indispensable , but equally essential was the provision of adequate human and material resources .  
With its limited financial and human resources , it is trying to control the problem at the national level , and to contribute at a regional and international level in an integrated and comprehensive manner .  
Administered in accordance with the state of medical art they are indispensable , but if they are abused they can lead to enormous human suffering , loss of social status and disastrous economic consequences .  
Theirs is a noble task , critical for the saving of human lives in an international climate of recurrent and widespread regional conflicts and crises .  
The presence of foreign troops within the territories of sovereign States , in the name of protecting the social , cultural , ethnic , linguistic or religious rights of minorities , can not justify any effort to promote human rights .  
The Charter required a steadfast commitment to democracy , based on human rights and fundamental freedoms , prosperity through economic liberty and social justice , and equal security for all CSCE States .  
Women are entitled to the equal enjoyment and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
To these we must add size and strategic location , economic power - both present and potential - pace of industrial growth and technological progress as well as human and natural resources .  
Calls upon all Member States to ensure that the achievements of scientific and technological progress and the intellectual potential of mankind are used for promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
These may be times of vertiginous political and technological change , but we sometimes feel discouraged at the persistence of tenacious negative aspects of the human condition rooted in selfishness and in the darkest chapters of our history .  
Religious and tribal fanaticism , national psyches scarred by past traumas , totalitarian regimes , selfish interests , and more all these may play a negative part in determining the future of human society in the next century .

Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the High Commissioner attaches special importance to the equal status and human rights of women .

Encouraging public knowledge of human rights is the central goal of the programme , and the key role of national and regional institutions , nongovernmental organizations and civil society in human rights protection is largely recognized .

His Government had repeatedly expressed its opposition to that initiative because it clearly violated the most basic human rights of migrant workers and their families set forth in various international legal instruments .  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,

" Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Poverty eradication and social and economic policies for standards of living must be based on a recognition of the human dignity of the poor , the weak and the humble .  
Urges the High Commissioner to undertake initiatives for refugee women in the areas of leadership and skills training , legal awareness and education , and in particular in the area of reproductive health , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of the refugees , in conformity with universally recognized international human rights and the UNHCR Guidelines on the Protection of Refugee Women ;  
It was noted that the Moroccan Constitution established the equality of all citizens before the law and the rights of foreigners in Morocco , that Morocco had recently set up an advisory council for human rights composed of representatives of all parties concerned , and that bilateral and multilateral conventions ratified in the manner prescribed by the Constitution were incorporated in domestic law and their provisions could be invoked before Moroccan courts .  
It is noted with satisfaction that Senegal has been actively supporting international human rights activities at both the international and regional levels and that it is a party to numerous international human rights instruments , including all the major United Nations instruments under which supervisory mechanisms have been established .  
The Holy See approved of the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , which is an expression of the international community 's commitment to fighting violations of human rights , and it expressed its support by making a symbolic contribution to the special fund established by the Secretary-General to finance the activities of the Tribunal .  
During this Week , we should express our faith in the foundations of harmonious coexistence of peoples , the need to promote international cooperation , the defence and protection of human rights , progress , economic and social development and the full flourishing of democracy .  All of this should undoubtedly lead to the maintenance of authentic and stable peace .  
Besides , it is insufficiently acknowledged that democracy is merely a species of human rights and that human rights are composed of diverse elements , including those of a cultural , developmental , economic and social nature .  
This is equally true in the economic and social sphere , and with regard to the constant modernization and honing of democratic institutions , governance , control of the exercise of political power , full and absolute respect for human rights and the daily exercise of such rights and obligations on the part both of those who govern and of those who are governed .  
" The rights protected by the Constitution [ of the Federation ] include all those currently recognized in international human rights law and others which have not yet attained full international recognition .  There is also specific enumeration of a package of rights which would entirely reverse the effects of the practice of \ x { e50d } thnic cleansing . . .  
At the heart of democracy and its inherent political pluralism are certain basic guarantees that uphold the sovereignty of the people , the worth and dignity of the individual , the rule of law , full respect for and protection of fundamental human rights and , above all , the peaceful search for human development .  
The Executive Committee expressed its deep concern and preoccupation with the immense human suffering and loss of life in recent crises and the scale and complexity of current refugee problems , and deplored the incidence of armed attack and of murder , rape and other violations of fundamental rights , as well as refoulement and denial of access to safety .  
The development of the human and technical resources that are indispensable for the improvement of information and communication systems in developing countries and support for the continuation and strengthening of practical training programmes , such as those already operating under both public and private auspices throughout the developing world ;  
The greatest national benefit will be obtained if the exercise is based on the overall principles adopted by in-country preparatory processes , i.e . , the participation of civic leaders , the academic and scientific community , grass-roots community leaders and non-governmental and community-based organizations , the private sector and human settlements professionals .  
For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds , the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including , where applicable , the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights . "  
It follows that the existence of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights in a country does not as such constitute a sufficient ground for determining that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture upon his return to that country ; additional grounds must exist that indicate that the individual concerned would be personally at risk .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , Recalling chapters 7 and 28 of Agenda 21 , dd / adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the main objective of which is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor ,  
Recalling further General Assembly resolution 43 / 181 of 20 December 1988 , by which the Assembly adopted the Global Strategy for Shelter to the Year 2000 oo / and stated that enabling policies , whereby the full potential and resources of all governmental and non-governmental actors in the field of human settlements were utilized , were to be at the heart of national and international efforts ,  
The Assistant Secretary-General then stated that rural human settlements issues should not be neglected , as the overall situation of the urban and rural poor had become worse , with 40 per cent more people living in absolute poverty compared to 15 years ago .  
In its proposed work programme for 1996-1997 , UNEP planned to support the work of the Centre in improving the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people .  Finally , the Executive Director assured the Commission that she would carry out all the extra tasks that would arise out of Habitat II .  
It is the United Nations which , not limiting itself to those classical human rights born of the American and the French revolutions , consecrated the fundamental rights of the second generation and , in particular , economic , social and cultural rights which allowed it to enrich the contribution of liberalism of the century of enlightenment through the contribution of democratic socialism of the nineteenth century .  
Their vision can only be realized through a collective adherence to a common purpose based on the principles of equity , tolerance and social justice , by expanding human capacity and the attainment of human security through equitable development and the achievement of global sustainability .  
The Organization originated in the post-war era with the main objective of consolidating an international order founded on faith in fundamental human rights , the dignity and worth of the human person ; and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; an organization specifically mandated to maintain international peace and security and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
During the past half century the United Nations , as no other international organization , has acquired credibility as a reliable instrument for maintaining peace , as a mediator and active participant in the peaceful settlement of conflicts , and as a champion of human rights .  
At that meeting it was also said that better quality of life for all was the objective of sustainable development , the foundations of which are democracy , human rights , transparent and responsible management of public affairs , investment in the human individual and protection of the environment .  
The problems threatening international peace which arouse natural fears , create anxiety , work against the people 's well-being , cause enormous losses of human life and bring about an immense deterioration of social and economic development are no doubt the gravest problems , and they call for action for peace by all means possible . 
Neither massive economic assistance , nor a huge international presence can make a real difference if the human rights questions are left unaddressed .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
Based on the agreement concluded between the two organizations , we have indeed developed flexible forms of cooperation , not only in the political area , but in our joint efforts on humanitarian issues , human rights , sanctions-monitoring and operational presence .  
In this context , my delegation would like to voice its support for the United Nations ongoing work on initiatives relating to the Agenda for Development , which would help us find more pragmatic approaches to development and address the aforementioned economic , social and human security issues in all their dimensions in a more effective and fruitful manner .  
The deliberate creation of regional trading blocs , the introduction of managed trade and the attempts to link human rights , environmental considerations and labour codes to trade are major threats which , if implemented , would dim the hope of a free environment for trade .  
Nevertheless , the systematic abuse of human rights which tactical allies were allowed to engage in , and which also characterized the Soviet Union and its areas of influence , reduced the ethical quality of the world inherited after the ending of the cold war .  
We also need to reinforce the capacity of the United Nations to assist Member States in their efforts to improve democratic structures , including the holding of free and fair elections , the full observance of human rights , the rights of minorities and fundamental freedoms , the strengthening of the rule of law , the fostering of popular participation and accountability of Governments , and the development of a prosperous civil society .  
Though this sense of equality was repressed for three centuries by pragmatic measures that were respected but not implemented , and by the extreme zeal of monks who consulted no one in imposing a single faith on this immense geographical area , it was imbued with the spaciousness of the land , the rivers , the forests , the gentle climate , the mountains and prairies , whose influence produced a different type of human character .  
The volume of assistance we offered was the highest , in terms of gross national product , because we wanted to live in a world dominated by justice , a world whose hallmark is human compassion , a world in which the privileged will reach out towards the underprivileged without strings attached .  
There is an increasing realization worldwide that in major denials of human rights , which breed antagonisms and deep resentments , there lie the seeds of international discord as surely as in the clashes of economic rivalries and territorial ambitions .  
At the same time , we are convinced that genuine and representative democracy , free from foreign interference , must be the key element in preserving peace and observing the basic principles of respect for the fundamental rights of the human person and of economic and social development .  
After engaging in broad contacts within the system of Asian States , we have once again become convinced of the correctness of the conclusion drawn at the beginning of this century that Asia , with its enormous human , natural and intellectual resources , had every possibility of becoming the most prosperous region in the world .  
No one should rest satisfied while we are faced with the perpetuation of social and economic disparities between and within nations largely the result of parochial interests being pursued at the expense of genuine human concerns .  
It must be built upon and strengthened , recognizing always that the human rights whose universality and indivisibility we assert are about economic and social and cultural rights just as much as about the civil and political rights on which the developed countries tend to focus so much attention .  
The point is that , in such cases , there should be a minimum level of safeguards , through the application of a set of agreed , uniform rules and procedures , in order for the imposing and lifting of sanctions to take place in a manner that strikes a balance between , on the one hand , the interests of the international community and , on the other , the extent of the human suffering endured by peoples on whom the sanctions are imposed .  
Moreover , the selective policies pursued by some developed countries in liberalizing their trade and the disguised protectionist policies which are put in place behind a fa \ x { 84f7 } de of environmental , human rights or other considerations , contradict the spirit and the call for liberalizing international trade and would lead to the worsening and entrenchment of the present imbalances .  We welcome the World Trade Organization as it begins its work .  
Panama , which is today a stable and secure democracy respectful of human rights , with a Government that represents with full legitimacy a people determined to shape for itself a great future of peace and well-being , wishes to remain the cross-roads of international trade , open to all parts of the world , where , in an era of globalization and market integration , the goods and services that are the principal wealth produced by nations can circulate .  
But this is not a time for fear or regrets ; it is a time for new endeavours , a time to promote new forms , ways and means of international cooperation , with a view to generating , by cultivating the complementary development of our national individualities , the cultural , economic and human resources that can enable us to be free of poverty and backwardness and to open an ever-broadening road to understanding , tolerance , peace and prosperity as we enter the third millennium .  
It is precisely its global character which offers us its first and fundamental key and which confirms that there are indeed universal human rights rooted in the nature of the person , rights which reflect the objective and inviolable demands of a universal moral law .  
A decisive factor in the success of those nonviolent revolutions was the experience of social solidarity ; in the face of regimes backed by the power of propaganda and terror , that solidarity was the moral core of the power of the powerless , a beacon of hope and an enduring reminder that it is possible for man 's historical journey to follow a path which is true to the finest aspirations of the human spirit .  
In this wider breakthrough of understanding in the universe , let us be thankful that on this tiny planet there is on the East River in New York a piece of land where people meet to discuss problems some no bigger than an ant-hill and some larger thankful that somewhere there is a little hill called Everest near Kathmandu where lilliputian human ants can crawl up and become heroes !  
The Beijing Conference , along with the other global conferences held at Rio , Barbados , Cairo and Copenhagen , have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development , which must be informed by environmental , social , demographic , gender and human - resource considerations .  
But what would it have been like had the United Nations not existed to channel activities for peace , to oversee the post-war period and the cold war , to give its moral sanction to the emancipation of peoples , to coordinate assistance for economic and social development and to set a moral standard and order relations among nations and human beings ?  
Natural resources restored , revived and protected from continuous and uncoordinated overexploitation must be managed by citizens , families and communities , who shall learn to acquire know-how , to share knowledge , to spread information , and to tap both the vast , exciting stockpile of human knowledge and their own rich national culture .  
Thus , for those who believe that the African is less than human or is incapable of governing himself , the existence for almost a century and a half of a politically stable and peaceful Liberia with strong economic potential is undesirable .  
The international community 's ability to offer a decent and secure existence to all its citizens is called into question by the numerous human tragedies , atrocities of war , terrorism , traffic in illegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of our planet .  It is self-evident that global cooperation and effective action is a sine qua non for effectively combating these and other evils tormenting world society .  
Such developments have been accompanied by a natural yearning for the achievement of development in both its economic and social domains , while developments on the negative side have generated a wider cycle of racial , national and religious disputes in some regions of the world that have led to a noticeable retreat from respect for human rights and basic freedoms of the human individual , as well as regression of development both in the economic and social spheres .  
Perhaps this new humanitarian world order , because of its aims which would make the human being the main focus of international action in such areas as the eradication of poverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gap between the rich and the poor , on both the individual and societal levels , may well furnish the solid foundation upon which we can build the desired new world order whose parameters have not crystallized as yet .  
The United Nations is to be credited with impressive accomplishments in strengthening international peace and security , marshalling the efforts of the international community to put an end to colonialism and apartheid , ensuring the independence and sovereignty of developing countries and supporting their socio-economic development , advocating human rights and fundamental freedoms and protecting and preserving the environment , as well as in promoting education , culture , science and health .  
On the contrary , despite our smallness and our relative lack of resources , we have been a consistent and active contributor of troops to various peace-keeping missions .  Fiji has paid a heavy human and financial price for contributing troops , but it has done so gladly and willingly and will continue to do so .  
At the same time , the General Assembly must always be solicitous of this principal organ when it comes to preserving the dignity of eminent international judges and their staff and when human and material resources are required to enhance the efficacy of this institution and to promote good and diligent administration of international justice .  
Moreover , this initiative fell within a favourable context of human dimension and a framework of values and hopes that were largely shared by sovereign States and Governments linked by their use of the French language , which greatly helped the Agency first to be recognized internationally and then to grow .  
We also applaud the focus the Secretary-General has placed on practical international cooperation for global human security , for example , in the areas of emergency humanitarian assistance , effective governance and the key social issues which formed the agenda of the World Summit on Social Development .  
Regrettably , this great historic victory was attained at a high price : the heavy of loss of human lives , incredible suffering , unprecedented material losses .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
But the Organization now needs to rethink itself in order to devote all its resources human , financial , institutional and technical to the great undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and social imbalances and the related problems of the environment , in the conviction that this is not only a moral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening peace .  
None the less , the United Nations attained important and substantial achievements , outstanding among which were its significant contributions to avoiding another world war with unimaginable consequences , eliminating colonialism and racial discrimination , encouraging the codification of international law , strengthening the international system of human rights protection and promoting international cooperation for the improvement of the political , economic and social conditions of our peoples .  
In fact , many are unprepared to accept that human beings and nations are entitled to move steadily upward on economic , social , political and cultural trajectories which will provide genuine equality . 
At this crucial juncture in human history we are compelled by social and economic imperatives , characterized by growing poverty and marginalization of the powerless and the weak , to choose a course of action that will empower the citizens of the world to develop their full potential in order to enable them to secure their basic needs and improve their livelihood .  
The commitment of resources at both the national and international levels ought to be focused on the development of programmes that place priority on the development of human capacities , and removing institutional and infrastructural impediments in order to facilitate sustained economic growth and sustainable development . 
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
This half century will also be remembered as a time of tremendous waste of human creativity and energy for purposes of destruction , a time of rising disparities between nations , of flagrant abuse of nature and its finite resources and , above all , of unprecedented loss of human lives and human deprivation despite the infinite possibilities opened up by revolutions in science and technology .  
International conflicts have been replaced by internal ones , characterized by political , economic , ethnic and religious tensions that often imply grave humanitarian crises and human rights violations .  
Notwithstanding the impressive achievements of the human race we are forced to live at the same time with unspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritual progress in which we might feel some pride as we approach the new century .  
They also underlined the necessity to reinforce the efforts and the measures directed to safeguarding the observance of human rights , in particular those related to education and work , calling on national , regional and international organizations to support the global development of the young generation under the sign of understanding , progress and friendship .  
The generation that enters the year 2000 faced with a perceptible crisis of ethical and moral values must renew with more vigour than ever its commitment to society , guided always by its convictions and never by considerations of convenience , respecting human rights and struggling with all its force for the perennial principles of justice , freedom and equality for all .  
As rightly observed and recognized , young people in all countries are both a major human resource for development and key agents for social change , economic development and technological innovation .  
Therefore , an overall system of enabling mechanisms is necessary , engaging the human , political , economic , financial and socio-cultural resources necessary for the World Programme of Action to be implemented on the national , regional and international level .  
A top priority of the programme has been the objective of eradicating poverty from the world as well as the commitment , on the national level , to take decisive action and on the international level to cooperate in the common endeavour to achieve that objective by focusing , both in policies and in action , on dealing with the root causes of poverty and on satisfying the human needs of all .  
Since its independence in 1956 , Tunisia has engaged in a comprehensive campaign to free Tunisians from poverty , ignorance and disease , as well as to ensure dignity and to build the basis for a modern national State as part of a complete development strategy based on investment in the human factor , and aimed at building a fully-balanced society that embraces all its segments without distinction .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran , inspired by the divine teachings of Islam and benefiting from national solidarity and the continued participation and efforts of its people , has endeavoured to develop a society on the basis of the dignity and worth of the human person and respect for human values , a society whose ethos includes fairness and social justice as well as cultural , social and economic development .  
These are some of the reasons that justify a rapprochement between Governments and the national olympic committees , and , moreover , that between the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee , with the objective of achieving democratic societies made up of citizens who are active in their defence of close and lasting human relations .  
It is my feeling that the United Nations and the Olympic Movement share a single universal ideal : to promote peace and understanding among nations and among peoples , with all their differences and their complementary features , by contributing to bringing cultures closer together and to promoting friendship among human beings in this world so often battered and torn apart .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations , as enshrined in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Georgiades ( Cyprus ) : In a world faced with unabated turmoil , the ancient Greek spirit that gave rise to the Olympian ideal of athletic achievement and excellence transcends the cultural and political boundaries that divide human communities .  
Throughout the gradual transition , the summit meetings of the Central American Presidents have institutionalized the process of regional integration and have given concrete form to the commitments undertaken in Esquipulas II , in which Central America pledged to struggle for peace and eradicate war , to ensure that dialogue prevailed over violence and reason over rancour , to give impetus to real democratic processes , and to promote justice and respect for human rights . 
The new principles of regional integration are based on respect for life in all its forms ; constant improvements in the quality of life ; respect for the vitality and diversity of our land ; peace , participatory democracy ; respect for and the promotion and protection of human rights , and respect for the multiculturalism and ethnic diversity of our peoples ; the economic integration of our region with the rest of the world ; and a responsibility that spans generations for sustainable development .  
The world community must continue to afford effective assistance to the Central American countries in averting new outbreaks of tension , in ensuring that the processes of national reconciliation in the subregion are irreversible by creating solid democratic bases for State structures , in strengthening the climate of political tolerance , in the strict observance of human rights , and in their economic recovery .  
In this respect , it must be emphasized that a solid democratic and pluralistic system , based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the covenants and international conventions on human rights , is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development , improving the standard of living of the lowest-income segments of society , and promoting civil and political freedoms and equality of opportunities . 
As we see it , the value of democratization is primarily that , having become an integral part of the internal political processes , it provides a basis for reconciliation , tolerance , full application of , respect for and defence of human rights , and the development of social practices based on the peaceful search for constructive solutions .  
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
The increase in the number of Member States to 185 ; the end of the cold war and the concomitant , regrettable radicalization of nationalism and group identity , which cause internal and inter-State conflicts ; and the perverse effects of the economic and financial crisis on the democratization of institutions and on human rights all these events and challenges highlight the urgent need to carry out a reform of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular . 
We are sure that these first 50 years are but the first stage in an unprecedented task that presents no other alternative , given that its chief goal that of assuring that we all live together in peace , as well as the comprehensive development of human beings can be attained only through disinterested cooperation among peoples .  
We do recognize also that there are some legitimate considerations that have to be addressed in the negotiating process , including internal territorial delineations and means to rebuild the confidence of the population in the political processes and mechanisms that are designed to secure respect for human rights .  
The tragic human suffering and the terrible material destruction brought about by more than 20 years of conflict also require that the international community following the round table on Angola being held in Brussels under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme continues to respond generously to the humanitarian aid needs and the challenge of reconstructing the country , particularly in the areas of demining and the social reintegration of the displaced and the demobilized . 
These variable criteria are subject to historical , human , demographic , political , economic , territorial and other changes .  
The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean certainly want such technical cooperation to be increased and more intensified and would like to see the United Nations double or even triple its human and financial efforts in order to fulfil this obligation , which is inscribed in the Charter and in countless resolutions of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies .  
Its contribution to disseminating information about the importance of free and fair elections , the participation of women and men as equal partners in social , economic and political life , and the protection and promotion of human rights and individual freedom has undoubtedly been singular .  
Greater cooperation here would make it possible for many of these challenges democracy and human rights , integration , development , international cooperation , and administrative matters such as the financing of the activities of the United Nations to be faced in optimal conditions and for there to be fluid channels of communication between the United Nations and national parliamentary bodies .  
We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .  
The Acting President : This morning , the General Assembly will , in accordance with the decision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting and pursuant to its resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 , devote a special commemorative plenary meeting at its fiftieth session to mark the United Nations Year for Tolerance , under sub-item ( b ) of agenda item 112 , Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The United Nations must tirelessly continue to demonstrate to the men and women of this era that the prevailing openness in the world offers a formidable opportunity for the future , an unexpected chance to transcend our differences in order to attain what I once referred to as the irreducible human element , that is , the quintessence of the values by which we define ourselves as a single human community .  
May this final celebration of the United Nations Year for Tolerance therefore also serve as the occasion on which we call for the redoubling of our efforts to close the apparent divides between us and overcome our momentary differences , our ideological and cultural barriers .  Let all of us therefore continue together , well beyond this special year , to work within the United Nations to instil the spirit of tolerance in the heart of the human community ( SG / SM / 5814 ) .  
In our view , the increasing awareness of the need to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms is closely and organically linked to and essential for the progress of society and the advancement of its members at the economic , political , cultural and social levels .  
The Charter establishes an important and immediate link between the cooperation necessary in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and the promotion and encouragement of and respect for universal human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Since prejudice denotes an irrational , unfavourable or hostile attitude towards members of other racial , religious or ethnic groups , we must , if we truly desire its defeat , engage ourselves in promoting , enhancing and defending the universal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
To meet the growing need for civilian personnel during crises , Canada will offer the United Nations secondment or the loan of civilian personnel on a short-term urgent basis to help in the development of a fully trained capacity in the areas of human rights , legal advice , humanitarian assistance , and other aspects of a rapid civilian response to crises . 
The national reconstruction plan and the economic and social development plan are based primarily based on sustainable human development through medium - and long-term programmes targeting the population affected by the conflict and the most vulnerable sectors of society in order to improve the quality of life and social mobility by improving the systems of education , of health , of housing and of creating sustainable employment . 
They pointed out that the responsibility of the United Nations in this matter should continue until the Palestinian people are able to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination , until an independent and sovereign State is established within its national territory and until the problem of refugees is settled in conformity with human rights instruments and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations .  
They now face the challenging tasks of reviving and modernizing national institutions , designing and developing both the human and the physical infrastructures , and rebuilding the economy by revitalizing agriculture , industry and trade and social services all with extremely limited resources and formidable impediments . 
We also reaffirm the importance of a continued role by the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the peace process and call upon Israel to honour its commitments under relevant resolutions of international legality in the interests of a better future of peace , tolerance , human development and economic and social development in the region .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
Recognizing that it is primarily responsible for its own development , and in keeping with commitments entered into under UN-NADAF , Africa has recently become involved in far-reaching and difficult reforms designed to accelerate the process of democratization , promote human rights and achieve economic , social and cultural development , in a climate of transparency and with the active participation of all positive forces .  
We should not lose sight of the efforts and activities by Africa to promote , enhance and achieve sustained economic growth and social development by addressing existing structural weaknesses , particularly building and expanding inadequate human , institutional and infrastructural capacities .  
We should resolutely address the endogenous impediments to growth and development , which include political instability , ineffective and inefficient utilization of both human and material resources , inappropriate priority-setting , ill-conceived policy orientation and ill-designed and impractical implementation mechanisms . 
A common agreement was reached in Copenhagen aimed at creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment , based on democracy , full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , equality between men and women , the elimination of all forms of discrimination , solidarity , transparent and accountable governance and administration , and the encouragement of partnership with free and representative organizations of civil society . 
Together , we decided on priorities and goals , and the Social Summit formulated a consensus strategy that generated the political will indispensable to the promotion of the human dimension of development as a priority objective , in particular in order to overcome poverty , increase productive employment and bring about social integration .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
We need to eradicate social and economic inequalities , both nationally and internationally , to create a stable , peaceful and healthy environment conducive to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Consensus in Beijing revolved around these basic principles : violence against women must stop ; girls must be valued equally with boys ; women must have equal access to education , health care and the levers of economic and political power ; family responsibilities should be shared ; and the human rights of women are an integral component of all human rights they are neither separable nor different from those of men .  
Thus , from the outset , CARICOM States have attached the highest importance to achieving the basic goals of the international community , which are reaffirmed in the resolution before us ; in particular , restoration of democratic order in Haiti , including the full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and the promotion of economic and social development .  
In this regard , it is essential for African countries themselves to promote sustainable development and greater political stability through , inter alia , State structures adapted to the new realities , the establishment of democratic political systems , a responsible and transparent management of public affairs , and respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
These figures highlight the fact that this is not a static problem ; it is a recurring humanitarian crisis that is worsening day by day and requires greater efforts and political will if we are to put an end to this inhumane situation in which human lives are destroyed , as is the environment as a whole .  
Our member organizations are situated around the centre of the ideological scale , our main principles being the promotion of civil society , individual human and civil rights , the collective rights of minorities and other endangered peoples and the achievement of peace and security on the basis of sustainable development , environmental protection and free-market economy .  
We urge the Special Committee to take very careful note of the documentation presented to it by Amnesty International , by other human rights groups and by East Timorese in exile , which details the ongoing human rights abuses in East Timor , such as torture , involuntary disappearances , maltreatment of political prisoners and extrajudicial killings .  The recent killing by the Indonesian military of 6 civilians in Liquica is but one example .  
So I ask Member States , when they hear us speaking out about the perils of radiation , to think about these in terms of human suffering and to try to visualize Marshallese children being born faceless , with no bones , or with missing or extra limbs the jellyfish babies , as some have come to call them and the irreparable damage wreaked upon the reproductive health of their mothers .  
In this so-called new era in which bipolar confrontation no longer exists , it is especially regrettable that the international community should be unable to arrive at a firm commitment on nuclear disarmament and on the complete elimination of these weapons of mass destruction , which continue to endanger the very survival of the human race .  
Emphasizing the importance of the integration of documented migrants into the host society , with due respect for their religious and cultural background , and the need to extend to them the same social , economic and legal rights as are enjoyed by citizens , in accordance with national legislation and universally recognized human rights ,  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development [ 4 ] / is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at providing the United Nations system , on a stand-by basis , with specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation , and , in this regard , notes with satisfaction the establishment , in particular in developing countries , of national volunteer corps ;  
Bearing in mind that the Treaty of Chaguaramas , signed at Chaguaramas , Trinidad and Tobago , on 4 July 1973 , 1 / which established the Caribbean Community , created a permanent body for intraregional cooperation , consultation and coordination in order to enhance economic , social and cultural development , including the optimum utilization of available human resources for sustainable development ,  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance and respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted at youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
Given the very low levels of per capita energy consumption in rural households in the developing countries at present , the absolute rise in residential energy consumption needs to be very rapid simply to satisfy basic human needs .  
States Members of the United Nations are invited to develop and implement an integrated national action programme for the development of and transition to an energy system that allows socio-economic development to fulfil basic human needs and improve the quality of life , takes care of environmental concerns , guarantees security of supply and uses finite resources sparingly , in the interest of present and future generations .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-19 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 20 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
" Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
He wished to draw attention to the suffering caused to the Libyan people by the unjust imposition of the sanctions , which had endangered many innocent lives , particularly those of the most vulnerable members of society , in blatant violation of human rights guaranteed under international human rights instruments .  
Japan appreciated the role played by the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in providing advisory services and technical and financial assistance at the request of Governments and the role played by regional human rights machinery in supporting human rights activities and programmes .  
The United States urged China to take further steps to improve the human rights situation in its territory by observing international norms , preserving Tibet 's unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage and releasing persons jailed solely for expressing political beliefs .  
First , it would be very useful if each committee responsible for ensuring the implementation of an international human rights instrument , in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights and the necessary experts , issued a document specifying , on the one hand , those legislative norms which were contrary to the provisions of the instrument in question and , on the other hand , those which were most conducive to its implementation at the national level .  
In the knowledge that sustained economic growth and sustainable development were decisive for the integral realization of human rights , the United Nations should urgently focus on establishing a mechanism to ensure the balanced promotion of civil and political rights , on the one hand , and of economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
Algeria was aware that the promotion and protection of human rights and democratic principles were primarily the responsibility of Governments , and it assigned a prominent place to those rights and principles in its project for the construction of a modern State based on republican principles and on the alternation of political power .  
For that reason they firmly supported the establishment of a global partnership which addressed all human rights and recognized that the universal enjoyment of human rights was hindered by the crushing debt burden and by structural adjustment programmes .  
While the human rights situation had improved in various parts of the world , it had grown much worse in the former Yugoslavia , particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where the policy of ethnic cleansing , accompanied by inhuman practices of unprecedented violence , had led to the exodus of entire populations and caused countless victims .  
Costa Rica was convinced that the fullest possible utilization of the existing machinery for the protection of human rights , which was now better coordinated thanks to the actions of the High Commissioner - together with the political will of States , played a crucial role in achieving the goals set out in the Charter of the United Nations .  
In considering the human rights situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia , it should be understood that the violations of those rights were the result of the political programme of the Belgrade authorities , who were pursuing their objective of territorial expansion or " Greater Serbia " through " ethnic cleansing " .  
To create a focus in national development plans and budgets on investment in human capital , with special policies and programmes directed at rural areas , the urban poor , women and children .  
The overall human settlement objective is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor .  
Developing local strategies for improving the quality of life and the environment , integrating decisions on land use and land management , investing in the public and private sectors and mobilizing human and material resources , thereby promoting employment generation that is environmentally sound and protective of human health .  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
The objective is to provide for the land requirements of human settlement development through environmentally sound physical planning and land use so as to ensure access to land to all households and , where appropriate , the encouragement of communally and collectively owned and managed land .  6 / Particular attention should be paid to the needs of women and indigenous people for economic and cultural reasons .  
Developing industrial and non-industrial planted forests in order to support and promote national ecologically sound afforestation and reforestation / regeneration programmes in suitable sites , including upgrading of existing planted forests of both industrial and non-industrial and commercial purpose to increase their contribution to human needs and to offset pressure on primary / old-growth forests .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
In the light of recent developments including increased international attention to population and development , and shelter and human settlements , as well as questions relating to migrants , refugees , youth , ageing , disabled persons , minorities , women and the family , a large demand for new and enhanced databases is seen emerging around the world . 
The Turkish Grand National Assembly has been closing its eyes to the numerous examples of flagrant violation of human rights in Turkey itself , particularly to the internal war of the Turkish Army against the Kurds , who are denied fundamental national and political rights .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism and criminal acts , as well as illegal drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
The comprehensive and integrated approach to human rights means that those rights are understood to be universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , which enables all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , to be dealt with on an equal footing and in a fair and even-handed manner .  
Since it was established in 1945 , the United Nations has elaborated a comprehensive body of international human rights standards and put into place a complex system of international supervision of national respect for those standards , which provide the High Commissioner with a solid foundation on which to build his own specific activities .  The Office of the High Commissioner was not intended to replace or duplicate the existing mechanisms .  
A number of areas of common interest and joint action in human rights were identified , including the question of minorities , preventive action , fact-finding missions , seminars and training , advisory services and technical assistance , particularly with respect to constitutional and legal reform , democratic elections , the administration of justice and the strengthening of infrastructures for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
Trilateral forms of cooperation between the High Commissioner , CSCE and the Council of Europe will be strengthened in the areas mentioned above through regular yearly meetings , effective and timely sharing of information and the establishment of focal points on human rights issues in each of the respective offices .  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the High Commissioner attaches special importance to the equal status and human rights of women .  
This was a matter dealt with by the World Conference , which recognized the need for a continuing adaptation of the United Nations human rights machinery to the current and future needs in the promotion and protection of human rights , as reflected in the Vienna Declaration and within the framework of balanced and sustainable development .  
She concluded by stressing the need for the strict observance in the occupied territory of international human rights instruments and humanitarian law , particularly as set out in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , since such instruments were the sole guarantee of the promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people and were the instruments on which the Palestinian people relied for justice .  
She referred to the latest report of the Special Rapporteur , which confirmed the persistence of grave human rights violations , the systematic and daily slaughter of innocent people , the odious practice of ethnic cleansing and forced resettlement , even in the so-called " security " zones .  
Now , 20 years later , almost 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus , a sovereign , independent , democratic State and a Member of the United Nations , remained under occupation , and gross and massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be committed there .  
Meanwhile the Greek Cypriots living in the occupied territory ( whose numbers had dropped from 22,000 in 1974 to less than 550 in 1994 ) continued to be the victims of discriminatory measures , harassment and violent acts and to suffer human rights violations ( 1,619 Greek Cypriots had disappeared ) and systematic looting of the cultural heritage of Cyprus .  
At the same time , on the domestic front , Turkey is not prepared even to discuss a multi-ethnic and multicultural concept , hence flagrantly and on a large-scale basis violating the human , national and political rights of the Kurds , waging a real internal war against them .  
In cases where a peace-keeping operation has been necessary , we believe it is legitimate and useful for the United Nations to maintain a presence on the ground after the end of the operation in order to ensure that its action is followed up in such a way as to contribute to a lasting restoration of peace through measures for coordinated consolidation in the economic , social , institutional , electoral , humanitarian and human rights fields .  
This calls for the strengthening of preventive diplomacy , including developing adequate early warning capacities , dispatching field missions , and utilizing the good offices of Governments , international or regional organizations or eminent personalities in order to get to the source of an imminent conflict and safeguard the security , well-being and human rights of the affected civilian population .  
Priorities have to be assigned , using the Programme of Action as a guide , among potential topics - for example , certain aspects of human sexuality , sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS , preparation for family life , promoting the status of women , developing among girls a positive and future-oriented self-image , the dynamics and implications of rapid urbanization , male responsibility and so forth .  
UNFPA regards family planning as a central component of reproductive health care : it allows couples and individuals to meet their reproductive goals ; is essential in reducing maternal mortality and morbidity ; is indispensable in reducing the incidence of abortion ; and contributes to efforts to prevent the transmission of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , including human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .  
Recognizing that the grave suffering of the great majority of human beings who live in conditions of poverty demands the immediate attention of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of relevant forthcoming United Nations conferences , particularly the World Summit for Social Development , and within the context of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty ,  
His report was thus based on the information that he had gathered in those countries , on numerous reports of United Nations bodies and humanitarian organizations active in the southern Sudan and on detailed reports from reliable sources concerning the situation of human rights in the northern and southern regions of the Sudan .  
However , he placed the main emphasis , as in his earlier reports , on the fact that government agents and members of various factions of the parties to the conflict in the south were continuing to commit many serious human rights violations - extrajudicial executions , systematic tortures , arbitrary arrests of individuals suspected of being political opponents , etc . - which affected all categories and strata of the population . 
Demilitarization , the control of small arms , institutional reform , improved police and judicial systems , the monitoring of human rights , electoral reform and social and economic development can be as valuable in preventing conflict as in healing the wounds after conflict has occurred .  
As peace and security are closely interlinked with political , economic and social development , including democracy and the realization of human rights world wide , crisis management should consist of an adequate combination of diplomatic , military , legal , economic , environmental and social measures of stabilization .  
In his 4 November 1994 report ( paras . 79-86 ) , the Special Rapporteur concluded , inter alia , that Bosnian Serb de facto authorities continued to be responsible for large-scale violations of human rights and , both directly and indirectly , for displacement of people from areas under their control , for systematic military attacks on civilians in the " safe areas " and elsewhere , and for grave disruption of humanitarian aid and medical evacuation programmes .  
In the Republic of Croatia , the Zagreb-based field staff through its numerous contacts with non-governmental organizations , its participation in relevant conferences and its exceptional access to top government officials , provided the Special Rapporteur with vital information , enabling him to make timely observations on the changing human rights situation .  
In reply to the question whether human rights education was incorporated in the school curricula , the representatives stated that attempts were under way to develop human rights education based on a national evaluation of the comprehensive school system , which set as basic criteria the respect for human dignity and for life .  
Responding to questions regarding health care plans for prostitutes , the representative emphasized that the authorities focused on the health aspect and instituted mandatory medical visits for prostitutes in order to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) / acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .  
Many crucial steps remain to be taken to achieve the political , economic , social and institutional reconstruction of Haiti and to provide for the Haitian people a peaceful and stable future based on democracy , respect for human rights and the rule of law and on economic and social justice .  
Serious violations of human rights and the mass exodus of a considerable portion of the Haitian population for political or economic reasons called for prompt and resolute action on the part of the international community , the United Nations and the Organization of American States .  
Globalization , which is a consequence of increased human mobility , enhanced communications , greatly increased trade and capital flows and technological developments , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy , particularly in developing countries . 
We , Heads of State and Government , are committed to a political , economic , ethical and spiritual vision for social development based on human dignity , human rights , equality , respect , peace , democracy , mutual responsibility and cooperation , and full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people .  
On the basis of our common pursuit of social development , which aims at social justice , solidarity , harmony and equality within and among countries , in full respect for national sovereignty [ and territorial integrity ] , as well as policy objectives , development priorities and religious and cultural diversity , and full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , we launch a global drive for social progress and development embodied in the following commitments :  
Reaffirm and promote all human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , and strive to ensure that they are respected , protected and observed .  
Promote changes in attitudes , structures , policies , laws and practices in order to eliminate all obstacles to human dignity , equality and equity in the family and society ; and promote full and equal participation of urban and rural women , and women with disabilities , in social , economic and political life , including in the formulation , implementation and follow-up of public policies and programmes ;  
Implement at the national level structural adjustment policies , which should include social development goals , and effective development strategies that establish a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resource development and further promote the development of democratic institutions ;  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It requires democratic institutions , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , increased and equal economic opportunities , the rule of law , promotion of respect for cultural diversity and rights of persons belonging to minorities and an active involvement of the civil society .  
Such an inclusive society must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
According to the Human Development Report 1994 , Chile had ranked eighth out of 97 developing countries in 1992 in the human development index , which took into account such indicators as infant mortality , daily caloric intake , adult literacy and average number of years of schooling .  
Ms . BARYARUHA ( Uganda ) said that prior to 1986 , Uganda 's human rights record had been among the worst in the world , and the country was still recovering from more than two decades of political instability and civil strife which had brought about social disintegration and a total breakdown of infrastructure .  
I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session under the agenda item entitled " Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " . 
Promoting effective enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and access to existing social protection and public services by , in particular , through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of all relevant human rights instruments ;  
They typically possess limited institutional and human resource capacity to assess the implications for sustainable agricultural and rural development of ongoing developmental plans .  
At the same time , many non-governmental organizations note and are concerned that factors such as distance , limited human and financial resources , and unequal access to information are tending to distinguish between those non-governmental organizations that are closely following international processes and those , particularly in the developing world , that are not .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The successful peaceful transition of South Africa to a democratic and non-racial society with human rights safeguarded by an entrenched Charter of Fundamental Rights has nevertheless left cultural , economic and social inequalities reflecting historical deprivation .  
Requests the Secretary-General , without further delay , to provide the Special Rapporteur with all the necessary human and financial assistance in carrying out his mandate and enabling him to submit in a timely manner an interim report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session under the item entitled " Elimination of racism and racial discrimination " .  [ 1 ] / A / 49 / 677 , annex .  
Considerable resources , both human and financial , have been devoted to the process over the past two years , in relation to support to the ad hoc secretariat , to Governments in affected countries , to the definition of the technical , scientific and political issues involved and to the formulation of the texts of the Convention and the regional annexes .  
Taking into account the positive developments in the process , which to some extent allay the concerns of the Council as expressed in its resolution 966 ( 1994 ) , my Government considers that the conditions have been created for the speedy constitution of a UNAVEM III with a specific mandate as set forth in the Lusaka Protocol , including technical , material and human resources sufficient for it to carry out its mandate .  
Indeed , despite the precarious situation and the difficulties inherent in moving from confrontation to cooperation on the path to national reconciliation , the steps taken by both parties and the stages that have already been passed have greatly helped to meet the conditions for the systematic implementation of the Lusaka Protocol , with a United Nations presence , whose human and material resources can measure up to its tasks . 
Invites the international development agencies and organizations , including the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations Development Programme , to take account of the potential of elderly women as a human resource for development and to include older women in their development strategies and programmes , and encourages Governments to ensure the inclusion of women , regardless of age , in development projects covered by national and multilateral financial institutions ;  
The three main objectives of the conference would be ( a ) to mobilize a political and economic " mountain lobby " capable of demonstrating to Governments , policy makers and planners the potential contribution of mountain areas to national and regional development ; ( b ) to introduce the financial and planning instruments needed to incorporate mountain development into national plans and budgets ; and ( c ) to examine the specific human , social and technological characteristics of mountain areas .  
Broad parliamentary support would be required to change the legal situation , especially in view of strong opposition from the Catholic Church , whose moral authority had been enhanced by its defence of human rights under the military dictatorship .  
Many non-governmental organizations feel that progress could be faster , pointing to continued forest damage and the apparently low levels of grass-roots involvement , and calling for the implementation of the FAO Peasants Charter to correct skewed land ownership or access patterns , which concentrate human pressure on the few forests that are accessible to the poor , thereby contributing to their degradation and loss .  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The criteria ( attached as annex II ) reflect the following top sustainable human development priorities for UNDP cooperation with Bangladesh : relevance to country programme objectives ; institutional and social sustainability ; environmental sensitivity ; targeting of the chronically poor ; affirmative action for women ; public management ; participation of beneficiaries and private organizations ; and national execution .  
The Committee suggests that the State party take steps to ensure the effective coordination between the existing institutions involved in the areas of human rights and children 's rights with a view to establishing a monitoring mechanism for the implementation of the Convention at the national , regional and local levels , which may assess the actual situation of children and narrow the gap between the law and its practice .  
The Committee recommends that the State party strengthen the coordination between the different governmental mechanisms involved in human rights and children 's rights , at both the national and local levels , and ensure a closer cooperation with non-governmental organizations , with a view to developing a comprehensive policy on children and ensuring an effective evaluation of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the country .  
Such an assessment was confirmed by the final document of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that the human rights of women and of the girl child were an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights ; that they should form an integral part of the United Nations human rights activities and be regularly and systematically addressed . 
In the area of poverty alleviation , sustainable human development will have to be promoted at the local level through support of the decentralization process and a strengthening of the technical , managerial and administrative capacity of local bodies , particularly departmental development councils and municipalities .  
The longer this situation continues , the more likely it is that we will be faced with a genuine structural public-service problem leading to inefficient use of national human capacities and a waste of resources .  
To summarize , the exact content and quantitative objectives of a Tunisian policy on sustainable human development , which will be reflected in the country strategy note , will emerge from the process of formulating Tunisia 's Agenda 21 and strategic studies conducted in the context of preparations for the ninth plan .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production of , traffic in and distribution of drugs , arms and precursors and essential chemicals , which at times places them beyond the reach of the law , corrupting institutions , undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Expressing deep concern at the immense human suffering and loss of life which have accompanied recent crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements , as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems , which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissioner 's crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight ,  
For those States that carried a large burden of foreign debt , structural adjustment programmes forced cuts in basic services and in investments in human development , shifting the responsibilities of basic social services from Governments to women without compensation .  In some developing nations , especially in Africa , the situation was further aggravated by a decline in commodity prices .  
Women , particularly through non-governmental organizations , participated in global , regional , national and community forums and strongly influenced the international debates on environmental management and conservation , human rights , violence against women , population and sustainable development , economic expansion and science and technology .  
Unless women 's human rights , as defined by international conventions and standards , are fully applied , interpreted and enforced in civil , penal and commercial codes and administrative rules and regulations , they will exist only in name .  
Unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women undermine women 's access to full and equal rights .  
Complete national law reviews by 2000 in order to incorporate the principles and provisions of accepted international norms and standards into national legislation and to revoke any remaining discriminatory laws ; ( d ) Provide gender sensitivity and women 's human rights training for all public officials , including law enforcement officers , legal and medical personnel , members of parliament and social workers , so that they may better exercise their public responsibilities ;  
Azerbaijan has repeatedly given tangible proof of its commitment to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and has based its approach to the solution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on the generally accepted international norms of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and respect for human rights .  
Also encourages the above-mentioned organizations to contribute fully to increasing world awareness of the problems and potential of human settlements as important inputs to social progress and economic growth , and world leaders to commit themselves to making cities , towns and villages in their countries healthy , safe , just and sustainable ;  
The main institution officially entrusted with the maintenance of public security is the National Police , which , according to a December 1994 study carried out by a Multinational Commission on Public Security , 2 / is seriously lacking in human and material resources , and is involved chiefly in administrative and protection functions in urban areas .  
With regard to the possibility that special laws or exclusive jurisdictions could be invoked to uphold impunity in respect of human rights violations , a careful study has begun of Guatemalan domestic legislation , with special reference to the military criminal justice system and the identification of cases in which the functioning of this special system could promote impunity .  
Other objectives reached have been : the establishment and regular functioning of bilateral working mechanisms with the Government and URNG ; the signing of agreements on security arrangements with each of the parties ; the establishment of close relations with the competent State organs in the area of human rights ; and permanent , flexible contacts with other human rights bodies and non-governmental organizations .  
The vast majority of cases involving death have not been adequately investigated or resolved by the competent authorities , and this increases levels of impunity , promoting a widespread feeling of insecurity among the public , and makes it more difficult to distinguish violations of the right to life which could be classified as human rights violations from common crimes without a political motive .  
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
These confidence-building measures , which could lead to an informal suspension of offensive military operations , would constitute a demonstration of good will aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population in areas affected by the armed confrontation , protecting human rights and facilitating the work of MINUGUA as well as all national entities devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights . 
The comprehensive agreement is the only agreement that has been in full force and subject to specific verification for almost a year now , yet the current status of compliance with it - the practical expression of which would be a marked improvement in respect for human rights in Guatemala - stands in stark contrast to and falls far short of what was agreed .  
With regard to military operations , until such time as a cease-fire is agreed to and takes effect , URNG insists on the commitment to respect the provisions of the comprehensive agreement on human rights intended to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population , protect human rights and facilitate the work of MINUGUA and of all national bodies devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights and the rights deriving from international humanitarian law .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
In this way , countries are part of coherent synergistic international programmes and networks that not only advance knowledge in the interests of all but also utilize more efficiently scarce human and financial resources , keeping duplication to a minimum .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards : 
Supported by a relatively strong foundation in science and technology and a critical mass of skilled human resources in the field of biological sciences , many countries , especially those in Central and Eastern Europe , can , with appropriate and timely support from the international community , move forward rapidly in biotechnology development and its safe applications .  
Action is urgently needed to facilitate the effective participation of developing countries in the process directed towards adopting realistic and up-to-date standards for intellectual property rights on biotechnology , taking into consideration new advances in and the understanding of biotechnology , as well as its crucial role in sustainable development , its potential impact on human society , and opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration and cooperation .  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Recalling that in the Charter of the United Nations the peoples of the United Nations declared their determination to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples ,  
Recalling also that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights , and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean ,  
Reiterating its profound conviction that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil and political rights and of economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Affirms that a primary aim of international cooperation in the field of human rights is a life of freedom , dignity and peace for all peoples and for every human being , that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interrelated and that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never exempt or excuse States from promoting and protecting the others ;  
Expresses its grave concern at attacks upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto , of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
Noting that , following the cease-fire of 18 July 1994 , a new Government of Rwanda has been established and has made efforts to restore the rule of law and reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , physical , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda after the extensive damage inflicted by the civil conflict ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , stresses the need to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and to the return by refugees and displaced persons to their homes , and welcomes in this regard the commitments made by the Government of Rwanda ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , physical , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to take appropriate steps to ensure adequate financial and human resources and logistical support for the speedy deployment of a sufficient number of human rights field officers and for the delivery of programmes of technical assistance and advisory services ;  
Deeply concerned about the recurring violations of human rights specific to or primarily directed against women by some members of warring factions in Afghanistan , and about the lack of respect towards them and their physical integrity and dignity , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ,  
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .  
Mindful of the dismay and condemnation expressed by the World Conference on Human Rights , held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 , at the continuing occurrence of gross and systematic violations of human rights , including summary and arbitrary executions ,  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , [ 3 ] / and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
Gravely concerned also at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , in particular summary and arbitrary executions , torture , forced labour and forced relocations , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detentions , restrictions on fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of expression and assembly , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Recalling the pertinent resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights condemning the flagrant violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , including its most recent resolution , 1994 / 74 of 9 March 1994 , [ 4 ] / in which the Commission decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a further year and requested him to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session and a final report to the Commission at its fifty-first session ,  
Deeply concerned by the deterioration of the overall human rights situation in Iraq and the continued massive and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , such as summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , enforced or involuntary disappearances , arbitrary arrests and detentions , lack of due process and the rule of law , and of freedom of thought , of expression , of association and of access to food and health care ,  
Deeply concerned further by the increasingly severe and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq against the civilian population in southern Iraq , in particular in the southern marshes , where the combination of massive drainage projects and wide-ranging military operations on the part of the Government of Iraq has forced residents of the marshes to flee in large numbers , many of whom have sought refuge on the border between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran ,  
Also expresses special alarm at the grave violations of human rights in southern Iraq , and urges the Government of Iraq to implement without further delay the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur , including , inter alia , the immediate halting and reversal of the draining of the marshes and the cessation of its military activities against the marsh Arabs , whose survival as a community is endangered ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ;  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by women of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights attaches special importance to the promotion of the equal status and human rights of women .  
The chairpersons stressed that all human rights contained in the international instruments applied fully to women , and that the equal enjoyment of those rights should be closely monitored by each treaty body within the competence of its mandate and that a common strategy should be developed by the treaty bodies in that regard .  
The major areas identified in the Plan are human rights and the promotion of equality ; employment promotion including improving the situation of women in the labour market , women workers in the formal and informal sectors ; training ; working conditions and environment ; social security ; labour legislation , labour relations , labour administration , workers ' and employers ' activities ; women in specific industrial sectors ; and in the different regions .  
The Conference also took a position against violations of the human rights of women in armed conflicts and considered , inter alia , that systematic rape , sexual slavery or forced pregnancy are violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
In many countries , the values of society are still strongly influenced by customary or religious practices and regulations that are sometimes in direct conflict with international human rights standards , as well as with national statutory laws where civil law differs from the customary or religious practices .  
The progress report focused on prerequisites of learning from experience with United Nations peace-keeping operations , and on the status of a ready capacity to act for six substantive components of complex missions : information , electoral , repatriation , human rights , civilian police and military .  
The exceptional cases of the alleged limitations of the human rights and freedoms of individual members of the Albanian national minority in Kosovo and Metohija are the exclusive consequence of the endangering of the constitutional order of the country and the breach of public peace and order through decades-long aggressive activities of the separatist movement in this autonomous province .  
A permanent international criminal court has been eagerly awaited by human rights advocates and Governments alike for more than half a century , and the document prepared by the Commission is a milestone in this direction .  
Undoubtedly the establishment by the Security Council of ad hoc tribunals such as those for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda marks a momentous progress in the fight against human rights abuses and fleshes out the basic demand for international justice as a means of contributing to real and lasting peace in countries torn by armed conflict and beset by large-scale disregard of human dignity .  
Other types of policies are needed for promoting economic growth and trade , changing demographic behaviour , developing human resources , alleviating poverty , promoting the transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound technology and financial resources , and managing natural resources .  
The major common economic characteristic of the poor is that they lack productive assets , either in terms of physical or human capital .  
Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
It is estimated that an amount of $ 100,000 would be required for human rights education and public information in Guatemala to educate and keep the public civic organizations and the mass media , both national and international , informed of the Mission 's activities and findings .  
A society for all is seen as an inclusive society which must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
In view of the evolving mandate of the United Nations in the fields of economic and social development , peace-keeping and peacemaking , human rights and humanitarian assistance , the availability of print materials for public information is an increasingly crucial aspect of the promotion of an informed understanding and effective support for the work of the United Nations .  
As part of its primary responsibility for public information activities built around the World Public Information Campaign for Human Rights and the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights held at Vienna in 1993 , the Department reprinted and distributed essential publications on human rights , including backgrounders on human rights and culture and on indigenous people .  
Decisions regarding the relevance of the proposals in the blueprint and responsibility for taking specific actions would rest with each country , organization or other entity , as appropriate , taking into account the diversity of economic , social , cultural and political conditions , while respecting duly approved international instruments and standards in the field of human rights .  
The possibility of reducing the huge financial , material and human resources devoted to the military sector and reallocating part of them to the civilian sector of national economies has been the object of deliberations within the framework of the United Nations for over three decades .  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ; 
In addition to its introduction and my concluding observations , the report includes seven sections , devoted respectively to military aspects ; public security aspects ; human rights , the judicial system and the Commission on the Truth ; electoral matters ; economic and social issues ; financial aspects ; and administrative aspects .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] : [ - The persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women ;  
Pursue and implement sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies , designed with the full and equal participation of women , that encourage broad-based sustained economic growth [ in the context of people-centred sustainable development ] [ sustainable development centred on human beings ] , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality ;  
A representative of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) emphasized that violence against women was a major public health issue , since it led to psychological trauma , depression , substance abuse , injuries , sexually transmitted diseases , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , suicide and death ; however , the victims rarely received rehabilitative care , or the compensation received by the victims of other injury-causing trauma .  
One organization asserted that this recommendation was unfortunately silent on existing mechanisms for inter-agency meetings on public information issues covering high-priority agenda items such as social and economic development , crime prevention and criminal justice , human rights , environment and sustainable development , women and development , population and refugees .  
Investing in formal and non-formal education and training for girls and women , with its exceptionally high social and economic return , has proved to be one of the best means of achieving [ sustained economic growth and ] [ sustainable development ] [ centred on the human person ] and for eradicating poverty . tertiary education has increased considerably . 
The establishment of an international criminal court to try individuals charged with crimes that pose a threat to international peace and security , violate basic human rights and forcibly subject others to torture in all its forms is a worthy objective sought by the international community .  
In connection with article 6 , paragraph 5 , we are of the view that , in assuring the representation of the principal legal systems of the world , the representation of Islamic penal legislation as a comprehensive and independent system that is rich in human experience and is authoritative for a large number of countries should not be overlooked .  
Within the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) emphasized the relationship between the economic and social aspects of development and the use of resources , considering the environment as a " sink " , absorbing negative impacts of human activities , and as a " source " , providing resource inputs into productive processes or providing final environmental services directly .  
During its special session ( 6-17 February 1995 ) on energy for rural development , the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development noted that adequate energy inputs were required for increased standards of living and productivity of human labour and for income generation in rural areas in developing countries where , on the eve of the twenty-first century , 2.5-billion people still have little or no access to commercial energy supplies and electricity .  
Despite numerous reminders about the Geneva Conventions and calls upon Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue as cited by your report of 22 March 1995 , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims . 
It was appreciated that the report of the Secretary-General on sustainable mountain development ( E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 5 ) , in addition to technical aspects , also covered the social , economic and cultural aspects of human development in mountain areas .  
While we are truly thankful for every single life that has been saved , we must be bitter about all the lives that have not been reached to be rescued and , most critically today , about all the lives that , after three years of systematic human rights abuses , deprivation and sieges , continue to be endangered and subject to the whims of those who have proven their disregard for human life .  
Despite the numerous reminders citing the Geneva Conventions and the calls upon the Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims as is , in fact , pointed out in the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report of 22 March 1995 .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the [ universal ] human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Implement sound macroeconomic and sectoral policies , designed and monitored with the full participation of women , that encourage broad-based sustained economic growth in the context of [ people-centred ] sustainable development [ centred on human beings ] , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality . 
international humanitarian and international human rights instruments to prevent all forms of violence against women in situations of armed and other types of conflict and undertake full investigations of all acts of violence against women committed during war , in particular [ systematic rape ] and sexual slavery , prosecute all criminals responsible for war crimes against women and provide full redress to women victims ;  
At its fiftieth session , the Commission established as the theme topic for its fifty-first session , to be held in April 1995 , " Strengthening regional cooperation in human resources development , with special reference to the social implications of sustainable economic growth in Asia and the Pacific " .  
The 1994 ECA " Economic report " confirms the continued deterioration in social and human conditions and the escalating absolute and relative poverty by pointing out that about 220-million Africans - almost half of the population in sub-Saharan Africa - now live in absolute poverty , unable to meet their most basic needs .  
At the regional and international levels , mechanisms and institutions to promote the advancement of women as an integral part of mainstream political , economic , social and cultural development , and of initiatives on development and human rights , encounter similar problems emanating from a lack of commitment at the highest levels .  
We came to this Summit , rightly called the " People 's Summit " , convinced that the only genuine path towards a new civilization must be one centred on the human person , on the vigour of human dignity and the freedom of the human spirit , and on the inalienable right of the individual to live a full life guaranteed by the existence of universal social justice .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , should enhance the relevance of vocational and technical training to both current and prospective employment conditions by applying a broad and flexible approach to human resources development for youth that fosters the capacity of skilled labour to adjust to changes in labour demand .  
Systematic violation of human rights and freedoms : mass arrests , abductions and murders , pent-up political trials , forcible mobilizations , evictions and ethnic cleansing , plunder , disrespect of religious freedoms , not acknowledging of national and religious institutions of the Bosniac-Moslems .  
As a result of this most irresponsible approach to the fate of their country and its people on the part of the leaders of the armed groups , the peace process in Liberia remains deadlocked : the cease-fire has been broken , and an increase in hostilities has been reported , accompanied by human rights violations on a massive scale .  
At the same time , since ONUSAL will be withdrawing on 30 April 1995 , the Human Rights Division has been emphasizing the urgent need to implement those parts of the peace agreements concerning human rights which are still pending , a matter which is of the utmost importance if El Salvador is to complete the framework of legal and institutional safeguards required in order to achieve democracy and lasting peace .  
The main purpose will be to establish a system of coordination and operation which , within the existing level of institutional management capacity , would lead to better planning and operational management by the United Nations system as a whole , with the result that scarce human and material resources are utilized more appropriately in the provision and coordination of humanitarian assistance in the context of the overall work of the United Nations system .  
The extraordinary ferocity of the war , the physical devastation , the deliberate massacre of civilians and the wanton indifference to human suffering have continued unabated for three years now .  
Taking into account the main development objectives established by the Territory 's Executive Council , namely , the improved management of the economy through a more efficient public sector , the strategic development of human resources through the reform of the educational and training systems , and the development of integrated policies of physical infrastructural improvements , as well as the preservation of the natural environment ,  
The subprogramme will address the need to protect the atmospheric environment from adverse change induced by human intervention and the requirement for accurate and timely assessments of the impact of climate variability and change on socio-economic systems ; ozone layer depletion and its effects ; and ambient air quality .  
ACC noted that while issues relating to economic reforms and growth were being pursued with vigour and financial support , mainly from the Bretton Woods institutions , the pursuit of the social and environmental dimensions of development , including the protection of human rights , was lagging , owing to a lack of adequate resources and a proper appreciation of the linkages among the various dimensions of development .  
An international symposium on sources of innovation in multilateralism was held , in cooperation with the University of Lausanne , Switzerland , in May to re-examine the nature of global changes and the challenges posed to the United Nations , including its reform proposals , as well as emerging new social forces such as women 's movements , endogenous peoples , human rights activists and others . 
The symposium , held in April and attended by more than 300 scholars , diplomats , NGO representatives , religious leaders , and journalists , addressed issues of peace and security , development , environment , and shared universal human values and norms that go beyond the concept of international cooperation in the " global neighbourhood " .  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
A second programme : " Applications of biotechnology for development " is presently a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life . 
The sectoral advisory services cover programmes relating to human rights , global development issues and policies , energy , human settlements , trade and development , population , natural resources , social development , public administration and finance , crime prevention and criminal justice , statistics and emergency humanitarian assistance .  
These activities include basic statistical and methodological work in national accounts , international merchandise trade , commodity production , energy , population and human settlements , the environment , prices , the role of women , social indicators and special population groups , and general integrated databases .  
In this context , technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments will seek to ensure an integrated and effective approach to economic and social development within the framework of the overall economic and social development priorities , policies and plans of the developing countries and within the orientations of sustainable human development , as well as , where appropriate , within the context of the peace-to-development continuum .  
The exercise analysed the current state of human development in the countries and identified broad development strategies that take into account the specific socio-economic characteristics , fragile ecosystems and limited natural resource base of these island economies .  
As a result , the Governments of Belarus , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Lithuania , Poland , the Russian Federation and the Slovak Republic have requested UNDP and ILO to assist them in the development of institutions and human resources , and the strengthening of various skills such as managerial , educational , entrepreneurial , human and institutional structures at the local level .  
In an era of financial stringency , the limited resources available to assist developing countries must be directed prudently towards those investments with the highest payoff ; experience in country after country demonstrates that water and sanitation improvements are vital to economic progress and , more broadly , provide the very foundations for sustainable human development .  
Welcomes the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ;  
At the same time , the practical activities of IAEA in implementing the safeguards should not hamper scientific and technical development or international cooperation by States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and should be based on optimum utilization of the Agency 's human and material resources .  
Article 1 ( c ) of the ECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents refers to the adverse consequences of industrial accidents on " ( i ) human beings , flora and fauna ; ( ii ) soil , water , air and landscape ; ( iii ) the interaction between the factors in ( i ) and ( ii ) ; material assets and cultural heritage , including historical monuments " .  
This latter definition is the real meaning of " intrinsic " as used in these legal instruments , and in any case the words " essential " and " inherent " do not mean that the adverse effects on the environment per se constitute a form of harm which is independent of human beings .  
The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
From activities scattered over a wide spectrum of disparate fields in the form of a plethora of relatively small projects , UNDP has moved steadily to concentrate its scarce human and financial resources on a small number of priority thematic goals .  
Executive Board decision 94 / 14 synthesized and built on a decade of gradual reform , 1 / providing UNDP with the three principal goals of ( a ) strengthening international cooperation for sustainable human development ; ( b ) helping the United Nations family to become a unified and powerful force for human development ; and ( c ) focusing UNDP resources on making the maximum contribution in its programme countries to key SHD dimensions .  
In the Seychelles , the national human resource development programme has as its objective increasing labour productivity through the creation of an enabling environment and incentives to the private sector and through reforms leading to greater capacity and increased efficiency in the public sector .  
The envisaged cooperation aims at supporting efforts of the member States of the two organizations to promote regional cooperation and sustainable human development through programmes and activities designed to mobilize and enhance human resources , to promote the environmentally sound use of natural and mineral resources and raise the living standards of the peoples in the countries concerned .  
Particularly in recommendation 9 , it has stressed the urgent need to gather data and disaggregated information on a gender basis , in a comprehensive and integrated manner , at the international , regional , national and local levels with a view to assessing the current reality of women , identifying persistent problems and challenging the invisibility of women 's human rights .  
That community must reaffirm that the human rights of women form an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and that the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international level , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex , are priority objectives of the international community .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
The World Summit for Social Development was remarkable in its scope : it gave a comprehensive meaning to social development , encompassing the functioning of society and all institutions for the overall objective of the betterment of the human condition and it placed people at the centre of all concerns and policies for sustainable development , proclaiming that all human beings are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with the environment .  
The Counsel for Human Rights expressed concern at the increase in political and social violence and the ineffectiveness of the State institutions responsible for investigating and punishing human rights violations , and pointed to the many unsolved cases of extrajudicial execution .  
Consequently , in the Agreement , URNG undertook " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " and , like the Government , it recognized the need to end the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants . 
During the period covered by this report , the Mission verified complaints of alleged violations by both parties of the commitment to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , as well as to end the suffering of the civilian population .  
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
The Committee was also informed that the distribution of resources had been guided by the priority areas as identified in the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised , 2 / and also by those reflected in the budget outline , namely , political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal oversight .  
Despite the constant attention devoted to this issue by a number of international and human rights organizations , and notwithstanding various statements from the Estonian authorities about their good intentions , legislative and administrative norms which basically discriminate against the Russian-speaking population are being reinforced and enacted into law in the country .  
The Acting Director emphasized that that situation limited the Institute 's capacity to provide the corresponding General Assembly committees with substantive contributions and research findings in critical areas of economic and social development processes , such as : water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , poverty alleviation , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
There is no doubt , as we indicated in our previous letter , that the Iraqi regime is unaware of the scale of the human suffering caused by the illegal imprisonment of the Kuwaiti and other prisoners because that regime is itself responsible for the suffering of its own people , about which it is totally unconcerned , as is proved by the following facts :  
Social justice at the national and international levels is an imperative , for only under an elevated form of social justice can the full potential of human resources development be realized .  
" human resources development is a broad concept . . . requiring integrated and concerted strategies , policies , plans and programmes to ensure the development of the full potential of human beings . . . so that they may , individually and collectively , be capable of improving their standard of living " .  
The second model , the information initiative approach , requires a series of basic steps that generate high quality of information , which then can be utilized to identify ( a ) shortcomings in the current human resources capacities of the public sector ; ( b ) types of professional development programmes needed in order to upgrade the quality of the staff ; and ( c ) the knowledge and skills needed for those who will be recruited into the public sector .  
The increased importance of transparency in the transfer and possession of conventional arms and the growing international interest in such transparency are justified by the fact that such weapons are virtually untouched by existing legislation and can cause serious human suffering .  
" Despite all our technological breakthroughs , we still live in a world where a fifth of the developing world 's population goes hungry every night , a quarter lacks access to even a basic necessity like safe drinking water , and a third lives in a state of abject poverty - at such a margin of human existence that words simply fail to describe it .  
It is possible clearly to visualize the possibility of identifying , within a social network , joint projects in such critical areas as , for example , the production of strategic information , the cooperative search for financing sources and collective negotiation of financing , the training of specialized human resources and the setting of quality standards in the evaluation of social programmes .  
Those who not only advocate but brutally carry out the policy of ethnic cleansing , national and religious superiority and the physical elimination of a people combined with the destruction of the traces of their centuries-old existence and the expropriation of their land and all other belongings , must not be treated in the same way as those who fight for religious equality , tolerance , coexistence , human rights and freedom .  
As if the Indonesian authorities were taking revenge for the restraint they had had to exercise before the international press correspondents gathered in Jakarta and Dili for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council ( APEC ) summit meeting held last November , East Timor has been swept since that occasion by a wave of new repressive and intimidating actions , leading to a serious deterioration of the human rights situation .  
This year , the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations which coincides with the twentieth anniversary of the illegal invasion of East Timor the question of East Timor is increasingly attracting worldwide attention , not only as a basic human rights issue but also , first and foremost , as a question of restoring the rights of a small colonial people , allowing it freely to choose its future political status .  
Economic and social development , democratic consolidation and the promotion and protection of human rights all require a strong , rational and predictable legal system for their effective implementation .  
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
In the short time that has elapsed since the Esquipulas I agreement , Central Americans have almost completely succeeded in containing the political violence that had ravaged several countries in the region ; democracies have been established and transformed ; respect for human rights has been strengthened , and the new regional integration system has been defined . "  
In addition , it could serve as a mechanism for political dialogue among the participating States in order to define common principles and interests with respect to both their internal stability ( State subject to the rule of law , human rights ) and external stability ( fundamental principles of good-neighbourliness among States , including general security questions ) .  
That high level of attrition at a stage when continuing learning is both optimal and desirable represents , from an educational and manpower planning perspective , a wasted national opportunity to expand and strengthen the human resource pool for the enhancement of national productivity .  
Furthermore , all the reports prepared in connection with acts of violence that have swept through the country since then indicate that serious , systematic and widespread violations of human rights have been committed and that international law has been violated .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The mandate included the following : all violations of human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , and in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; all forms of sexual harassment , exploitation and trafficking in women ; the elimination of gender bias in the administration of justice ; and the eradication of harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices , cultural prejudice and religious extremism . 
The guidelines suggest numerous preventive measures that may be taken such as practical improvements in camp organization , location and design ; human resources management measures including the hiring of more female staff ; measures aimed at encouraging the host Government to take effective legal and other action ; and preventive measures involving education and training .  
The 1994 World Development Report of the World Bank has documented substantial intra-national differences in performance between key infrastructural sectors critical to sustaining social development .  20 / The " human " aspects of sustained economic development are now considered central to successful social progress as specified in the documentation surrounding the preparation for , and completion of the World Summit .  
Sustenance of human resources through the necessary statutory , regulatory , legislative and participatory governance mechanisms that express the ongoing social will to support human resource development ;  
Ensuring the backstopping of essential human freedoms such as acceptably peaceful and equitable political , economic and social environments that promote individual , local and national security .  
In particular , better understanding is beginning to emerge of linkages between the supply process on the one hand ( population , education , health ) , and the diverse and dynamic activity of fluctuating demand for human resources ( in public and private sector employing establishments , as well as self-employment and a growing variety of less formal ways of making a living ) on the other .  
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
UNIDO offers a demand-oriented , integrated human resource development programme in three primary areas interlocking at three levels of support intervention : ( a ) policy advice based on analysis and assessment of requirements ; ( b ) institutional capacity-building and catalytic learning systems , including training , at subsector levels and in specialized fields ; and ( c ) communication networks to facilitate coordination and synergy of efforts .  
To be effective , intervention in this cycle must be multisectoral and comprehensive , and where possible focused on and supportive of the family / household as the critical socio-economic and cultural unit for sustainable human development .  
A strategy for transformation of education and training institutions is proposed , which reduces their isolation from the cutting edges of scientific and technological change , improves articulation between the supply of and demand for human resources through better understanding of systems of production , and acknowledges the crucial intersectoral links between the economy and society at both individual and collective levels .  
Major changes have included strengthening the overarching theoretical framework to identify and refine its major human resource development components more clearly , a narrowing of focus to key practical and high-priority activities , and updating implementing arrangements to reflect changing regional circumstances .  
In assessing costs for example of human resource development investments , the family decision-making structure will take into account inhibiting as well as motivating factors affecting their decisions to invest time in the schooling of girls , the opportunity costs of lost household or other ( e.g . agricultural , smallholding or commercial ) labour , or cultural / psychological stress on individuals as a consequence of non-traditional occupational or " career " choices .  
In paragraph 12 ( g ) , making economic growth and the interaction of market forces more conducive to social development requires " ensuring substantial public and private investment in human resource development and in capacity-building in health and education , as well as in empowerment and participation , especially for people living in poverty or suffering from social exclusion " .  
Paragraph 40 ( c ) of chapter II , section D , on enhanced social protection , points to the potential resourcefulness of older persons , suggesting that particular efforts should be made towards " ensuring that older persons are able to meet their basic human needs through access to social services and social security , that those in need are assisted , that older persons are protected from abuse and violence and are treated as a resource and not a burden " .  
The United Nations system can support these regional efforts , both by improving linkages , in terms of direct relevance , down to country strategies , as well as providing global communication of the commonalities and differences across regions , thus providing useful contextual and comparative information to those charged with human resource development planning .  
Its main functions include : ( a ) processing the dissemination of human rights as an effective means of guaranteeing their observance and consolidating the democratic system , ( b ) cooperating with relevant institutions to promote the teaching of human rights at the primary , secondary and university levels and in non-formal education and ( c ) promoting the alignment of domestic legislation with international agreements and treaties on human rights .  
It is important to demonstrate that surviving internal resources - physical , financial and human ( including displaced professionals ) are being drawn on to the maximum extent possible and geared to the rebuilding of the country .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
We call upon the authorities in Zagreb to hold inviolate the civil and human rights of the local Serb population and to treat all prisoners of war in accordance with accepted standards of international law governing the rights of military personnel in conflict situations .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
The Government of the Republic of Croatia is concerned that the magnitude of the human rights abuses against ethnic Croats in the " Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) " as well as in the remaining occupied territories of Croatia and in the parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by Serbs will increase and that this can only raise tensions and hinder the establishment of a lasting peace in the region .  
[ They are often subjected to [ various forms of ] sexual and economic exploitation , [ paedophilia , prostitution , forced prostitution and trafficking in human organs and tissues ] , violence and harmful practices such as [ prenatal sex selection foeticide ] infanticide , incest , female genital mutilation and [ forced ] early marriage . ] "  Paragraph 44 , last sentence .  
Overly complex administrative procedures , lack of awareness within the judicial process and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of all women , coupled with the underrepresentation of women in justice systems , insufficient information on existing rights and persistent attitudes and practices , perpetuate women 's de facto inequality . ]  
" [ All forms of gender-based violence , including those resulting from all forms of sexual harassment , prostitution , pornography , sexual slavery and exploitation , including those violations resulting from cultural prejudice , racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia , ethnic cleansing , religious and anti-religious extremism and international trafficking in women and children , are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and must be eliminated . ] "  Fifth sentence .  
" The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made at the meeting of the States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
However , even according to sparse reports of the relevant organizations , including the United Nations , it is more than evident that the atrocities of the Croatian army were abundant - indiscriminate shelling of columns of refugees , total destruction of entire Serb villages , looting and gross violations of human rights .  
Indeed , discussion of the issue has never been so extensive : the chairpersons stressed that all human rights contained in the international instruments applied fully to women ; that the equal enjoyment of those rights should be closely monitored by each treaty body within the competence of its mandate ; and that a common strategy should be developed by the treaty bodies in that regard .  
Their recommendations are largely general rather than focused on specific rights : it has generally been felt necessary and urgent to call for the respect of the non-discrimination principle , the conformity of national legislation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , accession to international human rights instruments , the elimination of discriminatory practices and the abrogation of laws that discriminate against women . 
The Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) , adopted by the General Assembly in 1989 and since ratified by 177 States , is an international instrument that promotes and protects the human rights of children in different areas ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ) .  
Intensify and coordinate international support for education and health programmes based on respect for human dignity and focused on the protection of all women and children , especially against exploitation , trafficking and harmful practices , such as child prostitution , female genital mutilation and child marriages . "  
In this regard , Earthwatch is exploring the potential to use schools , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , the media and other groups in building a more complete picture of the status of species , land uses , development activities , pollution problems and other characteristics of the human and natural environment as inputs for state-of-the-environment reporting and as a basis for selective continued monitoring of national and global trends and for filling data gaps .  
It should be noted that , had the total estimated requirement for substantive activities been approved , including training and human resources development , information and documentation services , joint activities and advisory services amounting to $ 434,858.44 , the budgetary distribution in the form of percentages of both administrative expenditure and substantive services would have been meaningful and well distributed .  
The Working Group also noted that these workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including forcing them to live separately from their spouse and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and strongly condemned practices of unequal treatment of migrant workers and the denial to them of minimum human consideration and dignity .  
While mercenaries are typically present in situations of armed conflict , it would be incorrect to limit the description to those cases alone , since it applies to any situation in which the sovereignty of States , the self-determination of peoples , political stability and the human rights of populations are affected in a premeditated fashion by operations in which the active agent is a foreign mercenary specially hired to carry out unlawful criminal acts .  
The content of the reports was similar to that of others reviewed by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and by the thematic rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights on the right to life and the physical integrity of persons , as well as by other United Nations organs and agencies that are attempting to devise a peaceful , just and lasting solution to the conflict and that are engaged in human rights or humanitarian relief activities .  
The presence of foreigners and alleged mercenaries in the 1991 war in Croatia and in the war in progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1992 coincided with serious violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights of the peoples affected , and psychological warfare played a fundamental role in the development of the armed conflict . 
This has facilitated the monitoring of borders , coastlines , territorial and international waters , space and natural resources by means of powerful , ultra-precise radar networks , instead of by land , sea and air patrols , thereby freeing up human , material and temporal resources so as to secure borders against enemy infiltration and guaranteeing the repulsion of any violation of the integrity , security and stability of States or entire regions .  
Total arms expenditure , including money spent on developing advanced technologies for military purposes , has absorbed considerable human , material and financial resources .  
The United Nations system continues to play an important role in many traditional areas of operational activities in several countries : nearly all developing countries cited technical and technological assistance , social development , poverty alleviation , health and education , and the improvement of human resources as continuing priorities for the United Nations system .  
My delegation is confident that a termination of the brutal hostilities and human carnage that Rwanda has endured for a good part of this century can most effectively be pursued through political means that emphasize peaceful solutions while being cognizant of the regional dimensions of the issues that confront Rwanda and impact its internal and external security .  
Cooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
A seminar was held in Indonesia ( December 1994 ) which identified concrete opportunities for Asian-African cooperation in such areas as improved agricultural productivity , human capital formation and institutional development .  
In view of the above , the XXth Postal Congress launched an appeal to Governments to provide the postal service with a statute and a modern management system that would guarantee it proper autonomy and adequate human and financial resources based on the notion of profitability .  
For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
However , in an increasing number of developing countries , with the accumulation of physical and human capital , technology and management know-how , the domestic base for more sophisticated services is being developed . 
At the regional and international levels , mechanisms and institutions to promote the advancement of women as an integral part of mainstream political , economic , social and cultural development , and of initiatives on development and human rights , encounter similar problems emanating from a lack of commitment at the highest levels .  
The Platform for Action reaffirms that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development - are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , as expressed in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights .  
Unless the human rights of women , as defined by international human rights instruments , are fully recognized and effectively protected , applied , implemented and enforced in national law as well as in national practice in family , civil , penal , labour and commercial codes and administrative rules and regulations , they will exist in name only .  
Overly complex administrative procedures , lack of awareness within the judicial process and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of all women , coupled with the underrepresentation of women in justice systems , insufficient information on existing rights and persistent attitudes and practices perpetuate women 's de facto inequality .  
Review national laws , including customary laws and legal practices in the areas of family , civil , penal , labour and commercial law in order to ensure the implementation of the principles and procedures of all relevant international human rights instruments by means of national legislation , and revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in the administration of justice ;  
Include information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected ;  
The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made by the meeting of States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] :  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
Considering that the ultimate purpose of the State is none other than to create more equitable societies in which all members can realize their full human potential in terms of the material satisfaction of their basic needs and their intellectual and spiritual development in conditions of freedom , dignity , equality of opportunity and full respect for fundamental human rights ,  
It requested States and relevant international organizations to coordinate their law enforcement activities and otherwise cooperate to pursue those engaged in the smuggling and transport of such human cargo ; to provide technical assistance to countries in developing and implementing policies to prevent and criminalize clandestine traffic in illegal migrants , and to punish its organizers , enhancing the professional skills of the personnel concerned .  
With regard to item 114 ( b ) of the draft agenda ( Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms ) , the Secretary-General wishes to recall resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 whereby the General Assembly , inter alia , decided to mark the end of the United Nations Year for Tolerance at a special commemorative plenary meeting of its fiftieth session .  
Massive violations of human rights , especially in the form of genocide , " ethnic cleansing " as a strategy of war and its consequences , rape , including systematic rape of women in war situations , creating mass exodus of refugees and displaced persons , are abhorrent practices that are strongly condemned and must be immediately stopped , while perpetrators of such crimes must be punished .  
The Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice .  
The humanitarian situation , which is particularly difficult , the observance of human rights , which can neither be renounced nor evaded , and the capacity of the local police to be effective , impartial and professional , are all important issues which must be addressed , on a priority basis , and for which we will also support efforts to show the commitment and the support of the international community .  
In their search for new opportunities and markets , organized criminal groups were ready to make sizeable investments in both equipment and human resources and were willing to bring their huge financial power to bear , in addition to using other more violent methods , for eliminating competition .  
The Government of Iraq noted that , in believing firmly in the right of States to the exercise of complete sovereignty and equality and respect for human rights , it strongly opposes the use by some developed countries of arbitrary economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against the peoples of the world with the aim of humiliating them and depriving them of their basic right to development and economic well-being .  
The Government of Iraq stresses that the coercive economic measures taken by some developed countries against developing countries constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law , the principles of human rights and the divine prescriptions of religious law .  
The use of unilateral coercive economic measures as a means of exercising political and economic pressure against developing countries constitutes a grave violation of the human rights of individuals , groups and people recognized in the Charter of the United Nations and in all international human rights instruments . 
A key component of its work is to see to it that national institutions play an effective role in the promotion and protection of human rights at the national level and forge close links with international bodies pursuing the same goal .  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .  
ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .  
Implicit in this approach is that women 's ability to compensate at the household level for the decline in output and for changes in the composition and level of aggregate demand is treated as infinitely elastic , obscuring the impact of macroeconomic policy on the human resource base of economic activity .  
This in turn is likely to have a negative impact on international economic competitiveness , balance of payments and economic growth , as the shortfall in human skills resulting from the adverse impact of macroeconomic policy remains unaccounted for and unplanned for in terms of appropriate supportive measures and resources , thus rendering the policy unsustainable .  
The complete embargo which has been imposed on the people of Iraq for the last five years , depriving the Iraqi people , including women , children and elderly , of their most basic legitimate right , which is the right to life , is not considered as a violation of human rights , since it was the wish of the forces hostile to Iraq , with which Mr . van der Stoel is cooperating .  
The Government of Iraq , guided by paragraph 31 of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights , which states that food and medicine should not be used as a tool for political pressure , looks to the United Nations and its humanitarian organizations to study the grave political , legal and humanitarian consequences of the imposition of the economic embargo , requesting that a mechanism should be sought to minimize those consequences and their dangerous repercussions on all human rights . 
It is clear to any impartial observer of the manner in which the Special Rapporteur deals with the human rights situation in Iraq and his activity in this area that Iraq 's position on him is correct and why Iraq accuses him of bias and lack of objectivity and of being an instrument for the implementation of the schemes of States and parties hostile to Iraq that aim at overthrowing its national regime , rending asunder its territory and fragmenting its population .  
Although true , Mr . van der Stoel 's words are intentionally misleading in that he claims to feel sorry for the children of Iraq , yet at the same time fails to request the lifting of the embargo against them ; on the contrary , he holds the Government of Iraq responsible for such human suffering on account of its non-implementation of Security Council resolutions 706 ( 1991 ) and 712 ( 1991 ) , despite being satisfied as to their political objectives .  
The mass media must also be mobilized with the support of non-governmental organizations , at the level of both States and regional organizations , in order to ensure the periodic dissemination of human rights information .  In addition , greater efforts must be made by the mass media to avoid propagating racist prejudice and stereotypes and to help the general public to form responsible critical opinions on the increasingly tragic events which tend to be trivialized in some circles .  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .  
ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .  
Implicit in this approach is that women 's ability to compensate at the household level for the decline in output and for changes in the composition and level of aggregate demand is treated as infinitely elastic , obscuring the impact of macroeconomic policy on the human resource base of economic activity .  
This in turn is likely to have a negative impact on international economic competitiveness , balance of payments and economic growth , as the shortfall in human skills resulting from the adverse impact of macroeconomic policy remains unaccounted for and unplanned for in terms of appropriate supportive measures and resources , thus rendering the policy unsustainable .  
NULLThe complete embargo which has been imposed on the people of Iraq for the last five years , depriving the Iraqi people , including women , children and elderly , of their most basic legitimate right , which is the right to life , is not considered as a violation of human rights , since it was the wish of the forces hostile to Iraq , with which Mr . van der Stoel is cooperating .  
The United Nations symbolizes the constant aspiration of men who , with a vision of the future , enshrined in the Preamble of the Charter the purpose of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war ; reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human being , and embodied among its purposes the maintenance of international peace and security . 
We must assume the historic commitment to accept the challenge and to devote ourselves with enthusiasm to the shaping of a new world , which will do away with political , religious and racial intolerance , which will eliminate inequality and social backwardness , which will establish human fraternity and solidarity , a new world in which the beacon of freedom and democracy will light its path . 
Today , we recall that almost visionary determination , and we are fortunate to do so in an organization that is vibrant with issues to address and problems to solve , and that is deeply involved in finding solutions to major international crises and increasingly committed to economic development , human rights and social and environmental problems .  
They called for the speedy establishment of a permanent international criminal court that would prosecute perpetrators of massive violations of human rights , including perpetrators of egregious acts of racial discrimination .  
NULLIn its resolution 1995 / 52 of 3 March 1995 on the situation of human rights in Togo , the Commission , inter alia , welcomed the fact that Togo had set out on the road to democratic political change , and urged all Togolese to respect the outcome of the parliamentary elections held in February 1994 and to ensure the effective functioning of the democratically elected parliament .  
Department staff held meetings with the senior representatives of the League to discuss joint actions to organize a regional seminar on a new integrated approach for sustainable human development : spatial / sectoral development strategy for Arab countries .  
NULLWithin the framework of the ILO / ALO joint programme agreed upon at the beginning of 1994 , five Arab regional seminars / expert group meetings were organized on the following topics : employment and labour market policies ; small enterprises development ( for employers ' organizations ) ; employment and labour market programmes in the context of sustainable human development ; and Arab and international labour standards .  
NULLCooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the League of Arab States continued during 1994-1995 in technical fields of mutual interest in the areas of agriculture and rural development , natural resources and environment protection , human resources training and global economic and social development .  
NULLThe Programme of Work had divided the remaining accords into six areas ( public security , land transfer , human settlements , reintegration programmes , Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and Disabled and legislative reforms ) and established dates by which specific provisions in each area must be completed .  
The employment-generating capacity of growth can be enhanced by investing in the more labour-intensive sectors of the economy , especially agriculture ; by increasing investments in human capital , i.e . , basic education , primary health care , nutrition and population programmes ; and by reducing or removing distortions in relative factor prices that arise from a malfunctioning of the labour market or of the market for credit . 
However , the coexistence of different groups is not always peaceful , and problems relating to minorities are today one of the major sources of international and internal conflicts involving widespread and at times massive human rights violations with severe repercussions for the peace and stability of the community of nations .  
In this multidimensional context , the question of the protection and promotion of the human rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities is of overriding importance for the respect of human rights generally and central to the promotion of understanding , tolerance and solidarity between and among communities and Governments .  
NULLIn a number of cases , special rapporteurs appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries and on thematic issues have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
NULLPursuant to General Assembly resolution 36 / 151 , voluntary contributions to the Fund from Governments , non-governmental organizations and private individuals are to be distributed through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of torture and to relatives of such victims .  
It is administered , in accordance with the Financial Regulations of the United Nations , by the Secretary-General , assisted by a Board of Trustees composed of five members who possess wide experience in the field of human rights , serve in a personal capacity and are appointed by the Secretary-General for a renewable three-year term of office on the basis of equitable geographical distribution and in consultation with their Governments .  
NULLThe programme of work had divided the remaining accords into six areas ( public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and Disabled , and legislative reforms ) and established dates by which specific provisions in each area must be completed .  
Besides the introduction and my concluding observations , the report is divided into six sections , related to : public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative aspects .  
The complex social and political circumstances of the rural human settlements indicates that the transfer of their productive , social and habitational infrastructure will remain an issue of particular delicacy , with a potential for aggravated social tension within the regions where they are situated .  
It was also agreed that funds reserved for the civilian component of the Mission should be increased to enable it to deploy constitutional legal experts , human rights monitors and mediators , and to facilitate the process of dialogue and national reconciliation in Burundi .  
The alleged perpetrators include clandestine organizations which , while claiming to be fighting against crime and impunity , have been responsible for threats of this kind , have thwarted investigations of crimes against human rights , caused the resignation of public prosecutors in high-profile cases and intimidated relatives and prospective new victims . 
NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
NULLThe process of investigating individual cases takes into account the rights of indigenous peoples as set forth in the Guatemalan Constitution and in international human rights instruments to which Guatemala is a party , particularly the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , and therefore emphasizes discrimination with respect to cultural , civil and political rights .  
NULLCooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
Promotion of effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
The United Nations General Assembly , by its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , considering , inter alia , that the promotion and the protection of all human rights is one of the priorities of the international community , and aware that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , decided to create the post of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights .  
NULLIn the meantime , human suffering of considerable gravity persists in the form of murder , disappearances and infliction of conditions that cause physical destruction , thus depriving people of fundamental human rights such as the right to life , the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .  
Factors such as deprivation of education , limited meaningful human contact and easy access to sophisticated weapons , coupled with the experience of the cruelties of war , destroy the value system of many young people , resulting in a failure to discourage them from participating in violent activities .  
Since the fall of KNU bases at Manerplaw in January 1995 and following the split in KNU in December 1994 , several reliable sources have reported that DKBO has committed widespread human rights abuses , e.g . , reprisals against civilians following insurgent ambushes , looting and forced relocations .  
NULLIt is worth noting that during the past two years the Government of the Sudan in its extensive written replies to the Special Rapporteur 's reports did not put forward one single argument supporting the consistency of the analysed provisions of its State legislation with applicable international human rights norms and standards .  
The Special Rapporteur believes that the racial dimension of the violations and abuses against children living in northern Sudan , or , in the case of children in southern Sudan , those who are abducted and sold into slavery constitutes a particularly grave and alarming circumstance , which should be of particular concern from a human rights perspective .  
In practical terms , the campaign against racism and xenophobia must be carried out by developing educational programmes , punishing those responsible for such practices , opening up new opportunities for members of racial and ethnic minorities and ensuring , at all levels , respect for human dignity .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
Assistance to human resources development totalled $ 64-million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Throughout 1995 , field officers have continued to travel from commune to commune meeting with civil , judicial and military authorities and local populations to learn about the general conditions of each commune , including security , access to property , the material needs and the functioning of the judiciary , conditions of detention centres and alleged human rights violations .  
The main purpose of the definition is not to create a new category of persons having special rights , but to ensure that protections recognized as the rights of persons in certain situations are extended to others in analogous situations and thereby promote a more harmonious and coherent approach to human rights .  
If , however , the country is unable or unwilling to meet the minimum standards required by humanitarian or human rights law , then these guarantees may have to be met through international assistance .  
As such , the programme has been unable to provide any substantial financial assistance to meet capital assistance needs which have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries which are committed to these ends but which face economic hardship due to economic problems , crisis or transition .  
While , for example , the value of training prison guards in human rights standards and techniques and providing expert assistance in the drafting of humane prison regulations remain clear priorities of the programme , such inputs lose substantial potential for positive impact if the guards , however well trained , and the regulations , however humane , are set in the context of substandard facilities and inhumane physical conditions .  
Such support might be facilitated by , inter alia , the substantial supplementing of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights ; the establishment of a separate , complementary fund for capital assistance in the field of human rights ; or encouraging increased support from development agencies and funds and financial institutions for financial and capital assistance for human rights and the rule of law .  
NULLIn recent years , the frequency and magnitude of major disasters , whether of a natural , technological or ecological origin , have made the world community aware of the immense loss of human life and economic resources that are regularly caused by such calamities .  
Accordingly , special attention had been paid to strengthening the Organization 's capacity to deal with political and peace-keeping activities , reinforcing international and regional cooperation for development , enhancing support for human rights and humanitarian activities , and increasing internal oversight capacity .  
NULLThe estimates relating to human resources covered staff on permanent and fixed-term contracts , temporary staff hired for varying durations of time , consultants , contractual personnel and expert groups .  
NULLWhile the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
During 1995 , the UNICEF Regional Office continued to work with the secretariat in developing analytical materials on major issues affecting southern African children , including human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and is exploring possible collaboration with the human resource development sector in the area of basic education .  
His delegation was therefore pleased that the Commission had decided to refer to the Drafting Committee only the articles concerned with aggression , genocide , systematic or mass violations of human rights , and exceptionally serious war crimes ; that decision demonstrated that the Commission was directing its work towards a realistic , rather than a political concept of crimes against the peace and security of mankind .  
Consequently , the United States could not accept the Human Rights Committee 's views in its General Comment No . 24 ( 52 ) , since it did not believe that the classic rules on reservations were inadequate for human rights treaties .  On the contrary , they had helped to advance the fundamental objective of broad participation by States .  
It should be obvious from the above that the Greek Cypriots are among the least qualified people to talk of respect for " human rights " when successive reports of the Secretary-General and international press reports attest to the fact that during the period 1963-1974 there was a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people by the Greek Cypriot side .  
They noted that this dangerous situation has led to tremendous losses in human lives , considerable material damage and unspeakable suffering among the population , including the massive movement of refugees .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
It involves the transmission of knowledge and the affirmation of values that emphasize peaceful coexistence , responsibility , tolerance , solidarity and justice and that promote the development of individuals who show social solidarity and who are active and tolerant in the political sphere , productive in the economic sphere , respectful of human rights and aware of the value of the natural environment .  
That a key element of reform is the selection of members with the requisite technical skills and broad managerial capabilities to enable the Commission to take bold initiatives to keep pace with global trends in human resources management and the changing needs of the organizations .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
If the level of women 's representation of between 30 and 35 per cent and above is considered to form a critical mass , the Secretariat can be considered to have achieved that status in such occupational groups as political affairs , legal affairs , public information , administration , social affairs , economic affairs , human resources and human rights .  
The High Commissioner also sought support for establishing national committees for human rights education , as focal points for Decade activities ; he asked that achievable goals be set and that the intellectual and material resources necessary to reach them be provided .  
It also welcomed the call in the Plan of Action for more systematic coordination among specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions and NGOs , and the assignment of that responsibility to the High Commissioner ; coordinated international action in the area of human rights education would result in more effective assistance to individual countries without weakening their sense of " ownership " of curricula reforms .  
The Committee was not provided with adequate justification for the posts being requested in relation to the programme of work for the completion of all outstanding areas of the peace accords mentioned in paragraph 3 ( i.e . , public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , protection of the wounded and disabled and legislative reform ) .  
Among the key issues which should be addressed were poverty eradication , global macroeconomic policy coordination , industrial development , economic diversification and the development of infrastructures , improved resource flows , including debt relief ; commodities policy ; human resource development and capacity-building .  
During the preceding six years his country had irreversibly embarked on the road to democracy , the rule of law and the protection of universal human rights and it attached the utmost importance to matters relating to minorities , a basic prerequisite for building a genuine democracy that would contribute to regional and international security and cooperation .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Welcomes the ongoing peace efforts and notes with satisfaction that fundamental humanitarian and human rights principles are to be included in the comprehensive peace agreements as indispensable elements to achieve a lasting peace ;  
The continued gross violations of human rights , the ethnic cleansing and the forcible return of refugees and displaced persons underline the importance of a firm commitment by all parties to human rights and humanitarian principles , and of international monitoring to ensure their compliance .  
International legal and related efforts in the field of environment continue to see rapid development , constituting a substantial framework of legal , administrative , economic , financial and technical measures to prevent , control and reduce the adverse impact of human activities on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems .  
His delegation therefore considered that the Commission 's decision to link the notion of proportionality to the regime of prohibited countermeasures envisaged in part two , article 14 was correct , but felt that it was inappropriate to prohibit any conduct which derogated from basic human rights , since neither the text nor the commentary indicated specific criteria for determining which human rights were " basic " .  
With regard to the new text of draft article 21 , Slovenia felt that the original intention to include in a single group both crimes against humanity as recognized by customary law on the basis of the Charter of the N \ x { e16c } nberg Tribunal , which applied only in time of war , and systematic and massive violations of human rights , represented an attempt to further the progressive development of international law .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
The coordination of human rights activities throughout the United Nations system was the subject of debate in the framework of the coordination segment of the Economic and Social Council ( 26-30 June 1995 ) which had on its agenda coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields . 
In line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , measures are being taken to make the human rights machinery : ( a ) more effective and cost efficient ; ( b ) able to act swiftly and to respond appropriately to human rights situations ; ( c ) stronger , through international cooperation in the field of human rights , based on mutual confidence ; and ( d ) more transparent and understandable to the outside world .  
The main focus of the country programmes , as determined during the missions , will be on the strategic management of industrial development , human resources development , quality control and standardization , the environment , private sector development , with emphasis on small and medium industries , and the implications of the Uruguay Round agreements for the industrialization of Africa .  
It was necessary to acknowledge once and for all that atomic radiation was capable of causing considerable damage , but such damage could take on catastrophic proportions in small States and manifest itself in heavy loss of human life and industrial and economic collapse .  
During the last half of March 1995 , a high-level team of three experts , including specialists in architectural , construction management , project scheduling , human resource monitoring and time extension analysis , accompanied by a representative of senior management from Headquarters , travelled to Addis Ababa to review and evaluate the situation , and to establish a course of action to ensure the timely completion of the project .  
The Croatian aggression resulted in major and forcible demographic displacement in the areas under the protection of the United Nations forces , i.e . , in mass resettlement and exodus of the Serbian population , violation of human rights , burning and destruction of their property including the Orthodox places of worship and Serbian cultural and historical monuments .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
The primary aim of the Special Rapporteur is to present an objective and impartial assessment of the human rights situation in all countries covered by the mandate on the basis of first-hand information gathered during her missions to the region , as well as information collected by the field operation established by the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat in the former Yugoslavia .  
Certainly , the human tragedy of this continuing matter is enormous both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship and in terms of the relatives of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .  
To the contrary , in the prevailing legal and political order in Iraq with life-threatening laws applicable to persons expressing any opposition to the Government , the conduct of the referendum made a mockery of relevant international human rights standards .  
The United Nations system 's operational activities for rehabilitation during the past year have focused on assisting local communities in rural infrastructure , food production , health improvement , animal health services , rehabilitation of disabled people and human settlements .  The main underlying purpose of these activities is poverty alleviation and human development .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ;  
Ad hoc tribunals could not be a substitute for a permanent international criminal court with the ability to prosecute persons accused of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law wherever the crimes were committed .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
But let me not be misunderstood : while we are deeply worried about the situation in Croatia , we are fully aware of the different qualitative and quantitative dimensions of the violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights violations committed by Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica , Zepa and the wider Banja Luka area .  
The Indonesian delegation shares the deep concern expressed in the draft resolution regarding the continuing violation of international humanitarian law and human rights in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia , as well as the potential consequences for the peace process if this terrible and tragic situation is not expeditiously dealt with .  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
An important area of activity of the Chair shall be the progressive development of a nationwide system of permanent education for democracy and peace through human rights , including the elaboration of special educational programmes for members of such services as the army , the police , penitentiary personnel , the teaching profession , public administration , the judiciary , etc .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in chapter V .  
The policy agenda agreed at the meeting had a strong accent on the following areas : ( a ) a greater external orientation of the least developed countries ' economies ; ( b ) development of a dynamic private enterprise sector ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) eradication of poverty ; and ( e ) a renewed commitment to provide external support .  
Review current global trends in economic and social development as they relate to human settlements , and include recommendations for future actions at the national and international levels .  
As demonstrated by the preparatory process , the implementation of innovative approaches for strengthening institutions and capacity-building do not necessarily require new institutional arrangements , but rather a reorientation of largely existing human , technical and financial resources within a coherent and internally consistent framework .  
Calling on the Secretary-General of the Conference to make appropriate arrangements for convening a regionally representative , independent and prestigious jury to review the best practice submissions and to provide special recognition to the most deserving initiatives promoting sustainable human settlements development in the form of awards to those organizations directly involved in the best practice .  
Given the fact that Rwanda has been ravaged by the genocide and armed conflict in which systematic and gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were perpetrated , the challenges of the rehabilitation effort remain daunting .  
Such a body , linked to the United Nations system and established on a solid legal basis accepted by all States , would be a useful tool which would allow the international community to prosecute and punish those guilty of particularly serious crimes whose hateful nature constituted an insult to the human conscience .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
A political consensus in the international community on the right to development was achieved for the first time at the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of the fundamental rights of the human person , the human person being the central subject of development .  
the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights " .  
In 1968 the interdependence of human rights and development was reiterated more explicitly in the Proclamation of Tehran , 5 / which provides that the achievement of lasting progress in the implementation of human rights is dependent upon sound and effective national and international policies of economic and social development .  
" an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
The right to development combines a comprehensive conception of development in its economic , social , cultural and political dimensions and a requirement of whole and entire realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the self-determination of peoples .  
It goes beyond the traditional conception of economic , social and cultural development by integrating in it the political dimension , basing it on popular participation and social justice , and focusing it on the human being , who is both its artisan and its chief beneficiary .  
As soon afterwards as 1968 the Proclamation of Tehran drew attention to the danger of this dissociation of human rights by proclaiming that : " Since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development points out that " All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development proclaims in its article 1 that " the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
It is one of the purposes of the United Nations , in virtue of the Charter , " to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion " ( Art . 1 , para .  NULL  
States , as the principal actors in the realization of the right to development , should guarantee the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms , strengthen democracy and ensure an honest and transparent public administration and an efficient and impartial administration of justice .  
During the transitional period , civilian tasks include ensuring that refugees and displaced persons can return , supervising property matters , monitoring human rights , re-establishing the normal functioning of all public services , coordinating international support and assistance and organizing and monitoring the conduct of elections .  
Cyprus supported a concerted preventive strategy encompassing preventive diplomacy , human rights , democracy-building , social and sustained economic development , an early-warning system and disaster prevention .  
Member and observer States of IOM were using a newly devised process of strategic planning to affirm and strengthen the organization 's role in dealing with the operational challenges of migration , increasing emphasis on better understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development , and working to ensure the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  
" Distressed at the continued suffering of refugees for whom a solution has yet to be found , and noting with deep concern that refugee protection continues to be jeopardized in many situations as a result of denial of admission , unlawful expulsion , refoulement , unjustified detention , other threats to their physical security , dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights ,  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
The United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , which was the core of the system of operational activities , had provided assistance in such crucial areas as national capacity-building in management , governance and democratization , private sector development and economic reforms , human resources , the social sector and the development of environmentally sound energy sources .  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The assignment of additional resources to a number of priority areas ( political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal monitoring ) was an important practical step , because the focusing of resources should make it easier to achieve the targets which had been set , while taking account of the financial situation of the United Nations .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to cooperate more closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Mr . TRAORE ( Guinea ) said that the five major conferences organized by the United Nations in recent years on questions relating to social development and the conference on human settlements to be held in Istanbul bore witness to the renewed interest and intensive mobilization of the international community in connection with those issues .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
had set up a national committee on human settlements that was coordinating joint efforts among Government organs , local authorities and non-governmental organizations with a view to effective participation in the preparatory process and in the Conference .  
argument was not worth entertaining because the problems of the shelterless , the slum dwellers and the inhabitants of urban areas with deficient civic amenities were so severe and caused such acute human misery , that they needed to be addressed with the utmost urgency .  
Mr . RUDENSKY ( Russian Federation ) said that the problem of human settlements , which encompassed social , economic , industrial , technological , administrative and environmental aspects , had taken on a global dimension .  
Zealand would continue to support the development of practical , flexible and equitable measures to enable the international community to achieve the Convention 's objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations at levels that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system .  
that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Condemns further violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian Armed Forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious , and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
Looks forward to the finalization of the interim report of the independent expert on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 7 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-second session ;  
that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
fact that UNHCR had been required to deal with increasingly frequent emergency situations and large-scale repatriations demonstrated that , if a lasting solution was to be found , root causes of the refugee problem had to be addressed , whether they be armed conflict , economic and social deprivation or gross violations of human rights .  
pointed out that the resolution mentioned above had been adopted on an initiative of the Sudan , motivated by its concern for the situation of more than 20,000 children who had been sequestered by the insurgent movement in the south of the country , which used them as explosives carriers , human shields in minefields and as a military reserve , a situation which was intolerable since it violated religious and humane principles .  
stark contrast between the forceful abduction and subsequent torture of a Turkish Cypriot by the Greek Cypriot police and the humane manner in which the above-mentioned Greek Cypriot offender was treated by the Turkish Cypriot authorities , fully in accordance with the legal procedures , illustrates which side in Cyprus respects human rights and the rule of law and which side is responsible for gross violations .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to increase its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
invoking the data from the reports of the previous Special Rapporteur , with whom the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia severed all relations because of his proven partiality , the authors of draft resolution A / C . 3 / 50 / L . 46 wish to portray that in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia there are " massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law " .  
unsubstantiated and generalized charges of alleged violations of the human rights of the Albanian minority in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are aimed at shifting attention from the open tendencies of the extreme political leadership of the Albanian minority in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija towards the secession of this integral part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights field operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
the global level , it was pushing for a ban on anti-personnel land-mines , an optional protocol to the Convention raising to 18 the minimum age of recruitment into armed forces , and a reordering of priorities away from military spending towards investment in human development .  
addition to ratification , however , there was a need for more decisive action at the national and international level , at a time when certain ultra-conservative and racist groups were seeking to impose discriminatory legislation that denied access to basic educational and health services to children of immigrants , in flagrant violation of their most basic human rights . 
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ;  
that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
the geographic coverage of operational activities had been extended to the CIS countries and their scope now also included administrative reform , the defence of human rights and elections , and financial resources therefore should have been increased accordingly .  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;

Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in General Assembly resolution 48 / 141 ,  
In view of the obvious link between human rights violations , the mass displacement of persons and the emergence of threats to international peace and security , Russia agreed with UNHCR that human rights monitoring must be one of the preventive measures included in plans for United Nations peace-keeping activities and in negotiations on peaceful settlement of disputes , and that safeguarding human rights was closely linked to the protection of refugees .  
The solution should also be a comprehensive one based on prevention , mitigation of damage to the environment and the search for sustainable solutions , which should be based on the political will to protect , defend and promote human rights , guarantee the participation of citizens in government and create an enabling environment for economic and social progress .  
achievement of sustainable solutions required national , regional and international solidarity , which meant that financial and human resources exceeding the capacity of a single country or small group of countries had to be mobilized .  
the meeting of heads of State of the subregion held in Addis Ababa in 1992 with a view to seeking a lasting solution to that human tragedy , it had been recognized that the only way of finally resolving the problem was not simply through achieving a peaceful solution of conflicts but also , and above all , through improving the economic situation of the countries concerned . 
Mr . AYALA LASSO ( United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ) said that the collective vision of the United Nations of the future was that of an Organization reflecting the fact that all human beings were the true participants in the historical process and should be the direct beneficiaries of national and international policies and actions .  
was unacceptable that many were unable to enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms , and it was essential that the international community should be aware of that , in order to make every effort to secure the enjoyment of those rights for indigenous people .  
Solutions to the problems faced by indigenous people must be worked out with their full participation and on the basis of full respect for their human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and identity .  
part of the enhancement of " the capacity of the Organization and of the United Nations system to support the ongoing follow-up to the Conference in the most integrated and effective way , including human and financial requirements " ( para . 32 ) , the Secretary-General is requested to ensure the more effective functioning of the Division for the Advancement of Women in order to carry out all the tasks foreseen for it in the Platform for Action by , inter alia , providing sufficient human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations .  
Looks forward to the finalization of the interim report of the independent expert on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 7 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-second session ;  
Encourages the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to request the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 23 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-second session ;  
that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
situation was critical in certain border provinces , which , overburdened by the provision of enormous financial , material and human resources in the fight against such criminal activities , should receive the support of the international community .  
At its 3rd plenary meeting , on 22 September 1995 , the General Assembly , on the recommendation of the General Committee , decided to include in the agenda of its fiftieth session the item entitled : " Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " and to allocate it to the Third Committee .  
its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , particularly resolution 1995 / 88 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people , and the need for a comprehensive approach by the international community to address root causes and effects of movements of refugees and other displaced persons and the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to make available additional human and financial resources to enhance the capability of the High Commissioner and of the Centre to fulfil effectively their respective mandates and their ability to carry out mandated operational activities and to coordinate efficiently with other relevant parts of the United Nations system on logistical and administrative questions , having due regard to the need to finance and implement activities of the United Nations related to development ;  
convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;  
that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
further that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
note of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , in which they describe the situation in Kosovo , the various discriminatory measures taken in the legislative , administrative and judicial areas , acts of violence and arbitrary arrests perpetrated against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Kosovo , including :  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
further the pertinent resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights condemning the flagrant violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , including the most recent , resolution 1995 / 76 of 8 March 1995 , [ 31 ] / by which the Commission extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a further year and requested him to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session and a final report to the Commission at its fifty-second session ,  
concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
gravely concerned at reports , including by the Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations , and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedoms of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial and forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; forced displacement of persons ; enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; and denial of the freedoms of expression , association and peaceful assembly ;  
concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
further that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
therefore welcomed the opportunity provided by the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to determine how best to make use of the changes at the international level with a view to enhancing respect for the generally accepted norms and principles of international law , for which purpose collective and sustained efforts towards the development and codification of the law in the areas of disarmament , the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts , the protection of human rights and the promotion of development would be required .  
that had to be complemented by action aimed at improving the terms of trade for the least developed countries , channelling foreign direct investment in a meaningful way and providing financial and technical assistance to develop human resources and build economic and social institutions .  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
fact , through the draft resolution before us , members of the Council have the opportunity to express , in a united voice and in the strongest possible terms , their condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights committed in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia , demanding that all concerned , particularly the Serbs , comply fully with their obligations in this regard .  
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
considered the question of capital punishment as a very sensitive human rights issue , and had always requested that it should be considered in international forums in a constructive and cooperative spirit .  
Government looked to the Chinese Government to take specific steps to conform to international human rights norms , including releasing persons detained solely for the peaceful expression of their opinions and preserving the unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage of Tibet .  
to observe basic civil rights to a fair trial and freedom of expression , as had been the case in Nigeria recently with the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other prominent human rights activists , destroyed confidence in the judiciary , frightened people and impeded their empowerment .  
With respect to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the conversion of some temporary posts to permanent posts should be deferred , he said it was difficult to demand a high level of efficiency from the Centre when significant new mandates had been assigned to it without commensurate human and financial resources .  
programme had been mentioned in two General Assembly resolutions , resolutions 48 / 132 and 49 / 194 , and represented not only an initiative designed to help Member States to build and strengthen their national capacities , but also an aspect of international action in the field of human rights which deserved recognition as being equal in importance to the monitoring mechanisms . 
MEKDAD ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action had stated that all human rights were universal , interdependent and interconnected and that the international community should deal with human rights in a comprehensive , equitable and even-handed manner , while taking regional and cultural specificities into consideration .  
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
he said that States were currently faced with a choice : to be part of a harmonious international system whose regional and international efforts were based on human morality , or to remain indifferent to sedition , ethnic cleansing and ideological hostility .  NULL AMOR ( Tunisia ) reaffirmed Tunisia 's commitment to provide all necessary assistance to United Nations refugee-related activities .  
It was essential for the international community to define and implement a global approach to refugee problems , based on prevention , the reduction of the negative effects of the presence of refugees on the host country and the search for durable solutions , in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of human beings and prevent other humanitarian crises .  
delegation was fully convinced that economic development alone was not enough to prevent humanitarian crises , and that political efforts were required to promote respect for human rights , the rule of law and responsible management of public affairs .  
VOLSKI ( Georgia ) said that his country 's traditions and culture were a clear example of the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic groups and religions and that the current obstacle to ensuring fundamental human rights was the grave economic and social situation .  
NAJEM ( Lebanon ) said that Israel was responsible for flagrant and persistent violations of human rights in the occupied territories of southern Lebanon , the western Bekaa and surrounding areas .  
the light of his findings , the Special Rapporteur puts forward a number of recommendations ranging from the consolidation of democratic institutions and the reform of the judicial system to the establishment of a national police force accepted by both communities and the deployment of human rights observers .  
It is equally important for Governments to facilitate the development of productive sectors ; mobilize national energies and resources for the provision of human capital and institution-building , infrastructure and basic social services ; develop long-term analysis , planning and evaluation ; promote sustainable development and equitable distribution of growth benefits ; and ensure the coordination of all development activities .  
A stable legal framework , fair and efficient law enforcement and equal access to public services and justice , in accordance with international standards of human rights , are essential conditions for the creation of transparent and accountable institutions , for the promotion of a public administration that is responsive to the needs of the population and for the prevention of and fight against all forms of corruption .  
We have also implemented educational reform , whose main challenges are to ensure reliable , ongoing training for our human resources by dynamic means , through an educational system that can be constantly renewed and improved in order to meet training and development needs .  
These included the rethinking of existing organizational structures and the introduction of role delineation ; the revision of existing legislation and the introduction of new legislation to reflect subsidiarity ; the introduction of an information technology infrastructure ; sustained development initiatives in management of change and business re-engineering ; the setting up of local Government to enhance citizen empowerment ; the revamping of human resources practices and procedures ; the new salary structure , which reduced 96 pay scales to 20 ; and the introduction of a code of ethics for all public officers .  
Among the objectives of the audit are the necessary refocusing of the administration on its essential tasks ; the organization and establishment of well-adapted structures and flexible procedures to carry out these tasks ; and the establishment of adequate resources , both material and human , for the effective and efficient functioning of the administration .  
Untiring efforts have also been made in the promotion of human rights , particularly in respect of information , democratic participation and the administrative and legal functions of democratic institutions guaranteeing the civil and political rights of the population , including documentation , the local administration of justice and civic education .  
The destruction , massacres and immeasurable suffering in Lebanon reported by the mass media , which show human bodies that have been cut up and mutilated , is unequivocal proof of the barbaric nature of the aggression taking place at the hands of the Israelis .  
The failure of the Security Council to act at the appropriate time , in response to Lebanon 's request , makes the Council responsible for the heavy human toll , the severe human suffering and the substantial physical damage sustained by Lebanon .  
It is our hope that the international community , represented by the General Assembly , will fulfil its collective responsibility and put an immediate end to the ongoing aggression , prevail upon Israel to implement United Nations resolutions , especially Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , and pay adequate compensation for human losses and the physical damage to Lebanese institutions , historical sites and service facilities .  
The new Mission was able adequately to ensure the presence of the international community and the direct support of the United Nations for the peace process , especially in the areas that proved to be most critical to the implementation of the Chapultepec Agreement : public security , constitutional and legislative reform , the land-transfer programme and the transfer of rural human settlements .  
At the same time , in operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution , the General Assembly welcomes the recommendation contained in the Secretary-General 's report to renew the mandate of the joint participation of the United Nations with the Organization of American States in the International Civilian Mission to Haiti , with the task of verifying full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to establish a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the consolidation of democratic institutions .  
In addition to paying tribute to the people of Haiti in its ongoing search for a strong and lasting democracy , justice and economic prosperity , the General Assembly reaffirms the international community 's commitment to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , with a view to supporting social and economic development efforts and to strengthening Haitian institutions that must administer justice and ensure democracy , the observance of human rights , political stability and economic development .  
International peace and security , free trade , social development based on growth with equity , environmental protection , democracy and human rights are the basic components of the future work of our multilateral system . 
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .  
Other pressing issues include the population explosion , environmental degradation , the water shortage , desertification , the food deficit , the growing gap between the North and the South , the regional arms race , the threat posed by nuclear weapons , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , development concerns , barriers to economic and trade cooperation , the removal of restrictions on free trade and , last but not least , human rights .  
In considering the architecture for United Nations renewal , we should shape an Organization better prepared to respond to the following four priority needs : first , restraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructive weaponry ; secondly , bolstering United Nations capabilities for effective peacekeeping and peace-building ; thirdly , assisting economic and social development while enhancing protection of the environment ; and fourthly , improving mechanisms for ensuring respect for international law and human rights .  
Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities of stemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction , bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building capabilities , advancing sustainable economic and social development , and reinforcing our joint commitment to international law and human rights ? 
One person less going to bed with an empty stomach , one person less torn with pain , one person less denied shelter small pragmatic steps inspired by the innate dignity of each human being ; acts of caring solidarity which each individual , each family , each community is capable of ; commitment to others generates hope .  
Portugal has repeatedly stated and I do so here once again that its sole objective , apart from the immediate concern of defending the human rights and identity of the people of East Timor in their different aspects , is to find a just , comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor , in accordance with international law and the full respect for the rights of its people , namely its right to self-determination .  
The consolidation of democratic Governments , growing respect for human rights and economic and social progress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for the future of Latin America , a continent to which Spain is linked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship and confidence .  
Despite the magnitude of the obstacles that have to be overcome in order to ensure that human beings are educated for peace , Mexico maintains a profound faith in the United Nations , whose structures must be strengthened if we truly wish to give it the necessary capacity to discharge the complex and lofty tasks entrusted to it half a century ago , as well as those additional tasks it is charged with almost daily . 
Any government , institution or individual seeking to promote human rights should bear in mind the significance of national and regional peculiarities as well as historical , cultural and religious backgrounds and the stage of economic development .  
We should be happy to do so without repeating any of the recent tired , uncharitable and inaccurate nostrums about the death of the obligation to accord economic preferences to poor countries , even as we clamour that human rights and humanitarianism have now been elevated to a place of honour in the international pantheon .  
The various protagonists must understand that only a new political agreement , based on ordinary common sense , with respect for the intangible principles of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , will contribute to an acceptable solution to all .  
This endeavour includes the aspiration to receive fair treatment in international economic relations ; to try to save children from starvation and disease ; to promote emergency assistance to refugees and disaster victims ; to attempt to combat crime , drug addiction and disease ; to promote education and the development of human resources ; and to tackle the enormous task of halting or slowing the progressive ecological deterioration of our planet .  
Tunisia 's steadfast efforts to consolidate the foundations of the country 's political institutions and the rule of law and to promote and protect human rights in their global dimension flow from a civilized , irreversible choice made in accordance with universal values .  
Eager to ensure respect for human dignity and to encourage ongoing development efforts to secure the well-being of all citizens , Tunisia has been able to reconcile , in a balanced manner , economic growth with the preservation of political , economic and social rights , the requisite foundations of democracy .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
If it is first and foremost up to the African countries to demonstrate that their marginalization is determined only by fate and that their current situation is merely one of those tragic aftermaths with which history has frequently sprinkled the course of human events , then it is also up to the international community as a whole , in active solidarity , to make a special commitment to supporting the efforts of the African countries to deal with the challenges before them .  
With regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms , I would underline the specific , dynamic and publicly visible results of some recent United Nations decisions , such as the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights , the establishment and effective functioning of International Tribunals to prosecute and judge persons accused of serious violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , and measures taken , or scheduled to be taken , in combating terrorism and organized crime .  
One can not talk simultaneously about the existence of universal values , such as democracy or human rights , and still feel satisfied with a situation in which poverty and the AIDS epidemic are steadily gaining ground , thus exacerbating the divisions within the international community and thwarting national efforts .  
The consolidation of democracy and the construction of a State based on the rule of law and respect for human rights are positive results of the activities of the international community , as reflected in the resolutions of the United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as in the decisions and recommendations handed down by several conferences organized under United Nations auspices or with its support . 
Since the beginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated and organized a number of world summit conferences on a set of global issues ranging from environment to social development , from population to human rights , from women to children and coming up we have the World Food Summit , the aim of which is to find and implement coordinated measures at all levels national , regional , and international to solve problems of importance for the future of all nations .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
The qualitative developments that have taken place in Mali 's northern regions show clearly the determination of Mali 's young democracy to tackle and resolve all problems in a concerted and peaceful way , with the active participation of all players and with scrupulous respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
We are therefore encouraged to think that the time has come for the establishment of a new global human order that would be based on respect for national sovereignty , participatory democracy , socio-economic equality , people-centred development and the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
If we were to agree that the chain connecting home , primary school , secondary school , university , and life broke down some time ago , and that it is missing its first link , without which all else is pointless and without foundation , we would invest at the very roots of human life the economic and scientific resources needed to form human beings from the start , enabling them to grow , endowed with the values that would make them citizens .  
Nevertheless , just as we understand that the world has changed , that there is a new international agenda governed by the common concerns of all peoples over environment preservation , population growth , respect for human rights , strengthening of democratic systems , recognition of women 's rights , and the social and economic development of nations , we also understand that this Organization must be renewed and readapted to the new world circumstances . 
Furthermore , these leaders unanimously called for in-depth reflection so that we might enter the twenty-first century with a restructured , reinvigorated Organization , equipped with the necessary human , material and financial resources to more effectively accomplish the lofty mission of an Organization that harmonizes the complementary efforts of Member States in order to achieve new goals in a context of freedom and active solidarity . 
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
We therefore share the anguish of the international community for those countries where internal strife and regional conflict , and their attendant human suffering , continue to deny economic and social progress to millions of their people . 
Despite these efforts , which have continued for several years , this twofold response has proved woefully inadequate to alleviate the ills that have slowed the progress and political , economic and social development of the human race .  
Despite this association and the new intellectual , political and economic trends brought about by the changes , the structural notions of the international system have not developed in tandem with the requirements of human development , as manifested by the communications revolution , the exchange of ideas , the flow of information and the technological applications that have influenced international relations in various ways . 
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It is a human , social , political and economic imperative for the international community and for all the actors and partners in development , in their own specific actions , to work responsibly for a more just and equitable framework for international trade , favouring a free and democratic economic partnership .  
The human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic is another scourge of our time and a serious threat to humanity .  The socio-economic consequences of the disease are a matter of grave concern , and the international community should make concerted efforts to address this human tragedy which affects the young and the productive sectors of our societies in particular before it is too late .  
There is evidence the world over that continuing poverty , if not addressed adequately , will result in social disharmony and in economic and political disorder , and will become a threat to national and international peace and stability , thereby negatively affecting the growth and consolidation of democracy and human rights .  
It has played a significant , discernible and indispensable role in human affairs , from the peaceful resolution of conflicts and peacekeeping to economic development and social progress , from food and agriculture to employment and labour standards , from helping the children of our world to fostering human rights and justice .  
The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States , the tragedy of refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the consequent destruction of the environment , the spread of disease , the degeneration of moral values , the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur .  
Its objectives responsible management , food security , development of human resources , the proper and effective use of natural resources , cooperation and economic regional integration are ambitious but feasible .  
It is already clear today that the conflict imposed on the Tajik people an enormous human tragedy was aimed at undermining the newly emerging foundations of the State and interfering with economic growth and market reforms and hence the country 's independent development along a general democratic course .  
Not only is this new Constitution the best we have ever had , but it also embraces the people 's political expectations for the advent of a true sense of justice and fair play as well as their deep love of freedom , respect for human rights , and a strong nationalistic feeling predicated on a desire to associate with the rest of the world on a free and equitable basis . 
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
Moreover , it will be in the cities and towns of this urban world that growing social tensions and conflict , rooted in poverty and the maldistribution of resources , will be resolved , and where the key to true human security will be found .  
The Government , in partnership with other sectors of society , is playing a multiple role in improving living and working conditions on an equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoy adequate shelter , affordable basic services and sustainable human settlements .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
The predictable result has been an explosion in the number of armed conflicts , accompanied by widespread devastation , both human and physical , gross violations of human rights , and ethnic cleansing .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
My Government has set itself specific goals including balanced and integrated sectoral growth , a relevant and adaptive education system , health for all , and strategic human resource planning and development .  
Given the proliferation of internal conflicts and regional tensions , the harmful effects of economic disorder , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the rise of crime and terrorism , violations of human rights , the ever-widening international character of drug-trafficking networks and the deterioration of the environment , there is no single area of international relations that does not require a collective effort on the part of States if it is to be mastered . 
Baali ( Algeria ) ( interpretation from French ) : Allow me , before making a few general comments on the report and role of the International Court of Justice , to perform the very pleasant duty of paying a well-deserved tribute to the President of the International Court of Justice , Mr . Mohammed Bedjaoui , a diplomat , jurist and statesman with exceptional professional , moral and human qualities , who has left a very clear stamp on the history of international relations over the last four decades .  
Chowdhury ( Bangladesh ) : At its fiftieth session the General Assembly reaffirmed the commitments made by the Heads of the State or Government at Copenhagen and decided to give highest priority to the national , regional and international policies and actions for the promotion of social progress , justice and the betterment of the human condition , based on full participation by all .  
It is focusing on strengthening the institutional capacities of government , at both the central and local levels , with regard to policy management and poverty monitoring ; promoting human resources development by providing better access to health and education opportunities ; alleviating rural poverty ; and developing and strengthening the basic social-safety net , among other issues .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation 's sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help to generate renewed political will at the national and international levels to attain the objectives of sustainable human development .  
Society must be firmly rooted in the rule of law , democratic participation , gender equality , the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all , social justice , tolerance , respect for ethnic , religious and cultural diversity , and meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs , such as young and older people , as well as people with disabilities .  
We in Japan believe that such genuine development can only be achieved on the basis of a comprehensive approach to development which would involve activities ranging over the economic and social fields , such as financial resource mobilization through official development assistance , investment and trade , and human resource mobilization through social integration of people by means of ensuring basic education , primary health care and empowerment of all groups of people in society .  
It is gratifying to see that the United Nations can be the international forum that enables the formulation and adoption , by the highest representatives of States , of such ambitious commitments as the commitment to eradicate absolute poverty by a target date to be set by each country , or the pursuit of the objective of full employment and the protection of social integration based on the enhancement and protection of human rights for all . .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
My country has assumed the responsibility to diminish poverty in the short term through social and economic strategies geared not only towards meeting basic physical needs such as health , nutrition , education and work , but which are also aimed at defending human rights and promoting the equitable distribution of income and wealth .  
There is a widespread feeling of dissatisfaction sometimes veiled and sometimes explicit with an Organization that still embodies the loftiest ideals ever conceived by the human spirit in the search for peace and understanding among peoples .  Brazil is committed to the United Nations Charter and to the Organization 's political , legal and diplomatic legacy of the past 50 years .  
In accordance with article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which Andorra signed and ratified less than a year ago , thus contributing to the universal process of ratification so desired by the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , it is vital that Governments ensure that tolerance and human rights are taught freely and comprehensively at school in order to rear new generations that are much more sensitive to the universality and relevance of these rights . 
Indeed , concurrent with the expansion of participatory democracy in many countries , a complex movement has emerged towards autocracy or even totalitarianism at the international level , a trend which is founded on hegemony and flouts justice , freedom , participation , the rule of law , tolerance , human rights , pluralism and democracy in a dangerous and unprecedented manner .  
Honduras is a firm believer in the fact that cooperation between the two organizations constitutes positive progress towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region , allowing the countries there to have a broader forum for discussion and negotiation in the search for solutions to economic , social , cultural , political and humanitarian problems and respect for human rights .  
We also consider very encouraging the progress made in the areas of human rights ; police training ; cooperation in regional human resources training through the United Nations University fellowships programme ; improved cooperation with the Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , as well as the joint programmes for international drug control aimed at harmonization at the local level of legislation and the work of the agencies responsible for this problem ; the improvement of the condition of women ;  
As this is based on a harmonious cultural hegemony that serves as a solid foundation for the defense of human rights , it is clear that there is a strong political will , public opinion and social awareness in favour of positive action .  
Turbay ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : As stated in the draft resolution before us today , the United Nations must be the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends such as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
This is a major responsibility of our territorial sovereignty and brings with it an inheritance of advances in technology , human labour and rapid interocean transportation in sum , the successful development of a valuable resource for worthy joint activities of benefit above all to the people of Panama and in general to all the peoples of the Earth .  
It is no secret that the North Korean regime relies for its survival on a totalitarian system of control and an anachronistic personality cult , sustained by subjecting its people to a virtual state of slavery , by denying them the most fundamental human rights , by supporting international terrorism and by all the other accompaniments of a failed , rogue State .  
We are committed to supporting the implementation of the recommendations , which we hope will lead to real progress in fostering human and social capacity , in strengthening economic performance and in protecting the environment , thus laying firm foundations for a better future for all African people .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) has focused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating progress in agricultural development , food security , human resources development , rural and urban development , the establishment and maintenance of infrastructures , the creation of the appropriate social environment , and the enhancement of regional economic cooperation .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
For their part , African people and their leaders need to continue to apply themselves to the immense task of bettering their prospects of recovery through ongoing programmes of political and economic reform , releasing the energies both physical and intellectual of the citizenry through the protection and promotion of civil liberties and fundamental human rights , and through the empowerment of women and youth , who are the underutilized agents of economic endeavour .  
It has been acknowledged by the United Nations , by the specialized agencies and by the entire international community as a whole as exceptional in terms of urgencies and opportunities , which calls for an exceptional mobilization of political will , and of human , technological and financial resources in order to speed up implementation of the New Agenda for the remainder of the decade and beyond , in later years , in line with the draft resolution recommended in section IV of document A / 51 / 48 .  
The external environment must be supportive of the identified critical interventions for African development and recovery in such areas as the diversification of their export products , intensification of regional integration , human resource development , the provision of adequate resource flows and durable solutions to their external debts .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
The report of the Secretary-General on this item ( A / 51 / 381 ) is especially helpful in that it recalls the need to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States . 
a more practical , attainable peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interests of all concerned .  
El Salvador finds itself today on the road to becoming an open participatory society in full development , thanks , among other factors , to its enormous efforts in implementing an ambitious agenda of change and achieving the agreed commitments related to the transfer of land and human settlements , the strengthening of the National Civilian Police , the modernization of the judicial and electoral systems , and the ratification of international instruments on human rights . 
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
The incorporation of international human rights standards into national laws and policies and the building or strengthening of national institutions capable of protecting and promoting human rights and democracy under the rule of law are an inseparable , essential part of the democratic reform process and hence should be supported .  
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa , now so dramatically changed in the space of a few days , underlines the importance of being prepared to respond in a timely , coordinated and effective manner to humanitarian crises in order to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
One can not but conclude that the progressive development and codification of international law would benefit from the recognition of the primacy of national laws in their interaction with applicable international law in the conduct of States ; in the preservation of the environment and ecological balance ; in respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms ; in the need to contain and eradicate the inordinate and indiscriminate bite of terrorism ; and in the espousal of the democratic ideal .  
The application of the kind of measures referred to in the draft resolution introduced today by the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya not only represents an attack on the identity of the State concerned and on its political , economic and cultural elements , but also affects other sensitive areas such as the ability of the peoples suffering from those unilateral policies fully to enjoy their human rights .  
Furthermore , pursuant to resolution 1994 / 47 of the Commission on Human Rights , the Secretary-General informed that body , in his report contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 43 , that application of unilateral coercive measures is incompatible with the principle of international cooperation , has an adverse impact on the economies of developing countries suffering under the measures and constitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the individuals , groups and peoples affected .  
Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
Given the progress made to date , we can not forget that we must move towards prohibiting and completely eliminating this kind of weapon , because of its mass , indiscriminate and devastating effects , its long-term threat , its tragic human consequences and its widespread hindrance of the productive use of broad areas , particularly affecting those most in need and seriously jeopardizing the living conditions of many peoples .  
The current international political and security situation is burdened with many crises , cases of blatant violation of international law , the uncontrolled hoarding of arms , upsets of the ecological balance , disrespect for human rights , widespread international terrorism , and tensions in economic and social development .  
Operative paragraph 1 reaffirms the work to be done by the joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States : monitoring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Haiti , providing technical assistance for institutional development in police training and in the establishment of an impartial judicial system and supporting the development of programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights to ensure coexistence and the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
It also recognizes the following essential bases for social development : democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , responsible governance and the participation of civil society , as well as peace , freedom , stability and national and international security .  
As I have stated before , Japan , which has experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently hopes that nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , will never again be used and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
During this time , Member States that have participated in the deliberations have spoken on a wide range of issues surrounding that continent , especially its role and influence on the atmosphere , oceans , biological conditions of the entire global system and the fragility of its environment , which is vulnerable to the impact of human activities .  
The systematic efforts to annihilate 20-million Iraqis were contrary to all international instruments , which must lead the international community to consider economic sanctions as an internationally prohibited weapon of mass destruction , since the application of sanctions against Iraq had caused significantly more victims than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima , which was ironic in the extreme given the degree of interest currently evinced in human rights . 
The long-standing bipolar nuclear confrontation has been replaced by mostly regional , subregional and intra-State conflicts arising from political , economic and social difficulties , and by massive violations of human rights , including those of ethnic minorities .  
Stresses that Governments , in partnership with civil society and all other development actors , including non-governmental organizations and people living in poverty and their organizations should cooperate to meet the basic human needs of all - inter alia , income , resources , education , health care , nutrition , shelter , sanitation and safe water - in particular of people living in poverty and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups ;  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
Stresses the need for Governments and relevant international institutions or organizations to examine how the rapid globalization of the world economy and the increased liberalization of trade is affecting the ability of States to design and implement effective strategies for eradicating poverty and to provide a stable legal framework that creates an enabling environment to achieve social development and to meet the basic human needs of all , in order to prevent greater inequality between different sectors of society ;  
Invites all relevant specialized agencies , funds , programmes and related organizations of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , to strengthen and adjust their activities , programmes and strategies , as appropriate , with a view to achieving the overall goal of eradicating poverty , meeting the basic human needs of all and promoting self-reliance and community-based initiatives , through , inter alia , financial and technical support to developing countries in their efforts to translate all measures , recommendations and commitments into operational and concrete programmes , projects and activities ;  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
The definition of basic human needs is broader in scope and extends to essential aspects of life , including employment , shelter and personal freedom .  Discussion focused on the provision of basic social services as an effective and cost-efficient way to reduce poverty and a fundamental contribution to the satisfaction of basic human needs .  
The occupation itself constituted the primary violation of the human rights of the civilian population and was the source of other violations and harsh practices by the occupying Israeli authorities , including closure and sealing of the occupied territories , land confiscation , the demolition of Palestinian homes , the detention of Palestinians , and the killing of Palestinians by military and undercover security forces .  
The violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by Croatian forces which were mentioned in the Secretary-General 's report on the situation in the occupied territories of Croatia ( A / 50 / 648 ) were a cause of deep concern , and Canada called upon the Croatian Government to prosecute those responsible , to do everything in its power to protect fundamental human freedoms in the territories under its control , and to permit the safe return of refugees and displaced persons .  
The Security Council strongly condemns the violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in the former sectors North and South in the Republic of Croatia , as described in the report of the Secretary-General , including killings of several hundreds of civilians , systematic and widespread looting and arson and other forms of destruction of property .  The Council expresses its deep concern that there is a considerable discrepancy between the number of perpetrators that have so far been brought to justice and the number of reported violations of international humanitarian law and human rights .  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Most of these countries were pursuing the following similar paths to increase or improve the quality of reproductive health services : ( a ) developing human resources , including training of medical and / or paramedical staff in reproductive health ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ; ( c ) developing medical protocols for RH / FP services ; and ( d ) increasing the availability of reproductive health services .  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
Themes found in both the guidelines and the common advocacy statement include putting people first ; promoting sustainable human development ; reducing gender inequality and inequity ; fostering accountability and transparency ; developing common indicators that are critical to the monitoring of programme impact ; strengthening country-level collaboration ; enhancing national capacity-building ; and facilitating dialogue between and among the United Nations resident coordinator system , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society . 
KODELLAS ( Greece ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that for the past 21 years it had been indisputable that the Cyprus problem was a clear case of the violation of the territorial integrity , unity and sovereignty of an independent State , of massive human rights violations and of the artificial division of a country by military force . 
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
The promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people could be guaranteed only by strict observance of the international human rights instruments and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , particularly as set forth in the fourth Geneva Convention .  
The most obvious case of grave violations of human rights in an industrialized country , however , was that of the United States , where the " American dream " was a tragic nightmare for vast sectors of its population in a society that was unable to conceal the situation of extreme inequality and open discrimination that affected tens of millions of African Americans , Latin Americans , Asians and indigenous people .  
Perhaps the most accurate picture of the true human rights situation in the United States was to be found in its judicial and penitentiary system , where 1.5-million persons filled the prisons of that country , which had the highest rate of imprisonment and the largest juvenile penal system in the world .  
The full realization of human rights , however , remained fragile , as was apparent not only from the tragedies in Rwanda and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , but also from the continuing violations in all parts of the world , which took the form of summary executions , arbitrary detention , disappearances and torture and manifestations of new forms of racism and xenophobia in disregard of the fundamental principles of humanitarian law .  
Other initiatives which his delegation was presenting to the General Assembly at the current session concerned the protection of minorities , which called for enhanced international cooperation to defuse conflict situations ; attention to the specific needs of children and juveniles in conflict with the law in the context of human rights in the administration of justice ; and the plight of internally displaced persons , in respect of which the work of the Secretary-General 's representative on that question had been crucial .  
The entire programme for the Decade should be aimed at a genuine democratization of international relations based on law through the creation of an atmosphere in which all States observed such fundamental principles as respect for the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of States , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of international disputes and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The human rights approach to women 's health implied that international and national policies must be based on recognition of women 's rights , including the right to reproductive and sexual health and family planning , and demanded full commitment to the removal of economic , social and legal disadvantages that denied women their right to health .  
The Government of Cyprus was committed to ensuring that women enjoyed all their human rights and that they were equal partners in shaping the economic , political , social and cultural development of their country .  
PAIK ( Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan ) said that Afghanistan was in a desperate situation on account of the continued armed conflict with its attendant massacres , disappearances and violations of human rights , and that the land mines which were still widely scattered throughout the country , despite the heroic operations of the demining programmes conducted by United Nations agencies and numerous non-governmental organizations still posed a danger .  
The collapse of the central authority also posed extreme difficulties for the protection of human rights , while the administration of justice continued to be arbitrary and local authorities were unable to prevent some sections of the population from engaging in arms dealing and trafficking in narcotics and cultural artifacts .  
It was also essential to create conditions for the reconstruction of civil society , particularly for the holding of free and fair elections and for building democratic institutions which would guarantee the rule of law and foster deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It must never be forgotten that behind the statistics , concepts and operational schemes were individuals caught in tragic situations whose only hope was a universal respect for the notion of human dignity , even if that was limited to the minimum for life , namely safety , food , shelter , water , medicine and basic education .  
In short , the enjoyment of human rights was closely linked to the international community 's ability to ensure the universal ratification and implementation of instruments that dealt with the rights that all States represented in Vienna had pledged to protect .  The meeting rose at 1.25 p.m .  
Taking into account the foregoing evaluation of institutions charged with protecting human rights and the radically changed political and human rights situation , the responsibilities of MICIVIH during a next phase would consist of two main elements : ( a ) technical assistance in the field of institution-building based on the observation and evaluation of institutional performance and reforms with reference to human rights ; and ( b ) the development of a programme for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
The training programme for trainers in civic and human rights education begun by MICIVIH would be expanded substantially to involve non-governmental organizations working in adult education , elected government officials at all levels , popular and peasant organizations , women 's associations , religious institutions and the formal education sector .  
To that end , the Ministry of State responsible for women 's status and problems , in cooperation with other State agencies , had undertaken the collection of gender-based statistics , developed programmes of vocational and technical education for girls and a policy of credit for women entrepreneurs , incorporated women 's human rights in the curricula of human rights education in secondary schools , launched public awareness campaigns and developed measures to eliminate violence against women .  
Thirdly and finally , the international community , through UNOMIL , humanitarian cooperation , support for the needs of economic and social development and the monitoring of human rights and the electoral process , inter alia , is strengthening national and regional efforts .  
If all those conditions , which were currently unacceptable and flouted the dignity of the human being , were to be eradicated , it was essential to create a framework for social development founded on a spirit of cooperation and participation which would take into account the cultural , historical , religious and economic characteristics and the priorities for social development of each country . 
Convinced that democracy was a prerequisite for respect for human dignity and socio-economic development , the Sudan had held popular congresses at the national , regional , provincial and local levels .  
Furthermore , as the participants at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen had underscored , the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms as well the strengthening of democracy within the framework of equitable economic relations and a favourable international economic environment were an integral part of social development .  
With regard to the human rights of women , particularly the right to equal status , which was dealt with in the Beijing Platform for Action , he stressed that the first woman prime minister in the world had been elected in Sri Lanka and that the election of Mrs . Kumaratunga to the office of President by an overwhelming popular vote indicated that Sri Lankans accepted the role of women in political and social life and their holding the highest public offices .  
He deplored the continuing flagrant mass violations of human rights taking place throughout the world , and concluded that the protection and promotion of human rights was a long and exacting task which required the undivided attention and vigilance of all members of the international community , from United Nations bodies and national Governments to non-governmental organizations and individuals .  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
In his report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the Secretary-General had stated that the lives of millions of Iraqis were threatened by hunger , which had not deterred the Power that currently dominated the world from deliberately ignoring the humanitarian and legal aspects of such threats or from using the pretext of human rights to serve its political purposes and seeking to overthrow the current legitimate Government of Iraq .  
Had the Special Rapporteur behaved in a neutral or objective manner , he would have called , without any hesitation and for purely humanitarian , legal and moral reasons , for the lifting of sanctions , at least in part on the grounds that human rights must be respected not only by individual countries but also by international organizations , particularly the Security Council .  
Of the initiatives taken by the High Commissioner , her delegation wished to mention , in particular , the machinery established in respect of special procedures , monitoring organs and non-governmental organizations , and especially the dialogue with Governments , since it considered that direct contacts with senior officials of Member States could only promote a better understanding of local realities and a fair appreciation of the development of the situation regarding human rights in Member States .  
The promotion of democracy , the strengthening of the protection of human rights and economic and social development formed an interdependent whole , as the World Conference on Human Rights had already stated ; democracy opened the way for the promotion and protection of fundamental freedoms but was able to sustain and consolidate itself only if it was able to respond to the individual and collective needs of citizens .  
In that connection , it should be underlined that the protection and international promotion of human rights would be effective only if they were based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social ) .  
Referring to paragraph 25 of the report concerning communications in which individuals or non-governmental organizations reported human rights violations , she said that her delegation insisted on the need to make judicious use of those procedures in order to avoid giving free rein to partisan judgements , and considered that , in order to preserve the credibility of the United Nations , the Organization should make every effort to prevent the machinery and procedures from being exploited for unacknowledged purposes .  
A strengthened Centre could not only mobilize public awareness but also provide vital assistance to Governments and non-governmental organizations in the field of advisory services and training with a view to facilitating implementation and understanding of human rights instruments at the national level .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
A particular weakness relates to understanding the interlinkages between economic activities and their social and environmental impacts , which can be distant in space and time ( though the knowledge base concerning the relationship between human activities and climate change has improved significantly in recent years ( see the report of the Secretary-General on chapter 9 of Agenda 21 ( Protection of the atmosphere ) ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 2 ) ) ) .  
It was in the best interests of all States to support genuine efforts devoid of any hidden political interest and to that end , to enter into a frank dialogue and to emphasize crisis prevention rather than simply reacting to human rights violations which usually accompanied crises .  It was in that spirit that his delegation supported the appeal for new human and financial resources launched by the High Commissioner for Human Rights .  
At the Vienna Conference on human rights , the international community had recognized that human rights were universal , indivisible and interdependent and had charted a course of action in the field of human rights into the next century ; however , its attention and efforts must be focused on the implementation of all existing human rights instruments , not only so that the perpetrators of human rights violations could be condemned but so that the rule of law should be respected in the future . 
There had been great progress in the human rights field since the establishment of the Organization , but , as the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights had stressed , the relevant instruments must be strengthened in order to make them more effective and so as to establish a better balance between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights , on the other .  
Aware of the importance of a human rights culture and of the need to strengthen the democratic process , her Government had implemented a series of legislative , administrative and educational measures recommended by the advisory committee on human rights , a national body established in 1990 , which was composed of representatives of the entire political , social and religious spectrum of Moroccan society .  
KAMAL ( Pakistan ) , speaking on agenda item 112 ( c ) , said that , while there were many types of human rights violations , the primary concern of the United Nations was the systematic violation of human rights committed by States and persons in authority and that the United Nations could influence Member States to take legislative , administrative and judicial measures to promote and protect human rights .  
SHAH ( India ) said that India , a pluralistic nation with well-established humanistic traditions of tolerance , harmony and non-violence , guaranteed fundamental human rights to all its citizens ; those rights were enforced by an independent judiciary and jealously guarded by a free and vigilant press , an articulate public opinion and a vast network of non-governmental organizations .  
India was encouraged that the international community had adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which underlined the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights , civil , political , economic , social and cultural , identified new forms of intolerance and violence and defined particularly vulnerable groups ( children and minorities ) who deserved special consideration .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
We reaffirm our commitment to South-South cooperation as a necessary and viable strategy for greater collective self-reliance for national , regional and global development and as a major mechanism for the promotion of growth and accelerated development , including human resource development , and affirm the importance of holding the ninth session of IFCC during 1995 , and our full support for the convening of a United Nations Conference on south-south cooperation in 1997 .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
The following questions , among others , were considered : protection of aboriginal people , including land claims and self-government ; protection against discrimination with respect to race and sex ; assistance programmes for minorities ; incorporation in human rights legislation of more explicit reference to economic , social and cultural rights ; judicial control over administrative decisions ; and differences between provincial and federal legislation in the field of human rights .  
The High Commissioner raised such matters as : arbitrary and preventive detention ; the treatment of detainees , including cases of custodial rape by members of the police and security forces ; cases of enforced disappearance ; failure to take judicial action against police officers accused of violations of human rights ; the partial application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to disturbed areas of the country ; social inequalities relating to the caste system ; and policies adopted to eliminate the caste of untouchable .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
The coordination of human rights activities throughout the United Nations system was the subject of debate in the framework of the coordination segment of the Economic and Social Council ( 26-30 June 1995 ) which had on its agenda coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields . 
The treaty bodies , based on six human rights conventions , have not only become effective structures monitoring the compliance by States with the human rights obligations resulting from those treaties : their impact in the field of human rights goes far beyond this function and extends , inter alia , to clarification of the content of human rights ; the functioning of the human rights machinery , including early warning and preventive measures ; cooperation of Governments with the United Nations ; protection of individuals in the framework of optional communications procedures ; and human rights education .  
In line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , measures are being taken to make the human rights machinery : ( a ) more effective and cost efficient ; ( b ) able to act swiftly and to respond appropriately to human rights situations ; ( c ) stronger , through international cooperation in the field of human rights , based on mutual confidence ; and ( d ) more transparent and understandable to the outside world .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Acknowledging the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , and its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
Lightly armed peace-keepers and unarmed civilians were sent into areas of active warfare , where their courageous efforts helped to save untold human lives and to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population .  
In addition , we are very concerned about the continued UNITA military activity in some regions of the country , in a pattern of military movement without prior notification to UNAVEM III and of isolated attacks and ambushes against civilian and military targets alike , almost always resulting in a loss of human life . 
The text was based on General Assembly resolution 49 / 194 , with a few new provisions incorporated in the light of the Secretary-General 's proposals contained in his report on strengthening the rule of law ( A / 50 / 653 ) , including a provision on the need to mobilize additional resources for the Centre for Human Rights and , in particular , one relating to the Centre 's programme of advisory services and technical assistance , which had a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law . 
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production of , traffic in and distribution of drugs , arms and precursors and essential chemicals , which at times places them beyond the reach of the law , corrupting institutions , undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Genocide , aggression , systematic or mass violations of human rights , exceptionally serious war crimes , international terrorism and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs were covered in the draft ; those crimes represented the most serious breaches of the peace and security of mankind .  
In Habitat II , Governments at all levels , the community and the private sector considered how the achievement of the two principal goals of " Adequate shelter for all " and " Sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world " can be furthered at the local level through an enabling process in which individuals , families and their communities play a central role .  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
It will provide the basis for national and international action to reduce pollution of the oceans from land-based activities , contributing , inter alia , to : ( i ) improvement of coastal habitats and productivity ; ( ii ) reduction of threats to food security and safety ; ( iii ) reduction of hazards to human health ; and ( iv ) increased control over coastal activities to stop and reverse the process of alteration of the coastal zone .  
Calling the attention of the international community to the role of oceans and coastal areas as a major governing force of the planetary ecosystem , as well as a determining factor of human life , recommend that greater priority be accorded at national , regional and international levels to the action set out in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 ;  
To demonstrate to the world its capacity to act as a force for improving social and economic conditions and for promoting global development and human prosperity , the United Nations system should direct its efforts towards implementing the action-oriented recommendations of the Secretary-General , as outlined by him in An Agenda for Peace 19951 and An Agenda for Development 1995,2 as well as those of recent major international conferences .  
The sooner communities , local governments , partnerships among the public , and private and community sectors join efforts to create comprehensive , bold and innovative strategies for shelter and human settlements , the better the prospects will be for the safety , health and well-being of people and the brighter the outlook for solutions to global environment and social problems .  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
Moreover , not content with falsely accusing Iraq in the tenth preambular paragraph of summary executions , arbitrary detention and torture , with the sole aim of tarnishing the country 's reputation , the sponsors had neglected to mention the positive developments that had occurred in Iraq , including amnesties granted to prisoners and initiatives to strengthen democracy , pluralism and respect for human rights , such as the right to free speech .  
His delegation rejected the draft resolution , particularly the provisions concerning the deployment of human rights monitors throughout Iraqi territory , since those provisions violated the principles of national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States and might set an alarming precedent for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
Establish and implement consultative mechanisms among the governmental authorities that are responsible for economic , environmental , social , human settlements and shelter policies , and the organization of civil society and the private sector so as to coordinate the shelter sector in a coherent manner , which should include identifying the market and precise criteria for allocations , subsidies and other forms of assistance ;  
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
The empowerment of women and their full and equal participation in political , social and economic life , the improvement of health , and the alleviation of poverty are essential to achieving sustainable human settlements .  Paragraphs 10 and 10 bis should be joined as a single paragraph .  
These resolutions , inter alia , demanded that the Government of the Republic of Croatia respect fully the rights of the local Serb population in the former Sectors following Croatia 's military operations , including their rights to remain , leave or return in safety , take urgent measures to put an end to all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights and investigate all reports of such violations so that those responsible for such acts be judged and punished .  
We , the States participating in the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , [ , are committed to a political , economic , environmental , ethical and spiritual vision of human settlements based on the principles of equality , solidarity , partnership , human dignity , respect and cooperation .  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
We reaffirm that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social - are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated .  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
Sustainability of human settlements entails their balanced geographical distribution or other appropriate distribution in keeping with national conditions , the maintenance of biodiversity and cultural diversity , promotion of economic and social development , and human health and education , as well as air , water , vegetation and soil qualities at standards sufficient to sustain human life and well-being for all time .  NULL  
Partnerships among countries and among all actors within countries from public , private , voluntary , and community-based organizations , the cooperative sector , non-governmental organizations , and individuals are essential to the achievement of sustainable human settlements development and the provision of adequate shelter for all and basic services .  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
The living and working conditions in all human settlements , including regional urban centres , rural service centres , rural hamlets , rural communities , market towns and villages , must be improved , with particular emphasis on shelter , social and physical infrastructure , and services .  
Consistent with local needs and conditions , such efforts should include improving human settlements management , encouraging the sustainable development of intermediate cities that create employment opportunities for unemployed rural labour , and providing environmental infrastructure .  
Other key elements of a poverty reduction strategy include policies geared to [ reducing inequalities , increasing opportunities , and providing access to resources and income ; ] providing social protection for those who can not support themselves ; recognizing the special needs and skills of women ; developing human resource ; improving accessible infrastructure including communication facilities ; and [ taking comprehensive national responsibility for meeting ] the basic needs of all .  
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Ensure that clean water is available and accessible to all human settlements by the year 2000 through , inter alia , the adoption and improvement of technology , and ensure that environmental protection and conservation plans are designed and implemented to restore polluted water systems and rebuild damaged watersheds ;  
It combines the challenge of security for all the basic human need of a reliable supply of safe drinking water and meeting the competing demands from industry and agriculture , which are crucial to economic development and food security , without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their water needs .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
Promoting construction methods , materials and technologies that are affordable , safe , efficient and accessible and that emphasize greater use of local materials and human resources , that encourage and support design efficiency and energy-saving methods , and that are environmentally sound and protective of human health ;  
We commit ourselves to the goal of sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world by developing economies that will make efficient use of resources within the carrying capacity of ecosystems and by providing all people with equal opportunities for a healthy , safe and productive life in harmony with nature and their cultural heritage and spiritual and cultural values , thereby ensuring social progress .  
We commit ourselves to the strategy of enabling all key actors in the public , private and community sectors to play an effective role - at national , state / provincial , metropolitan , and local levels - in human settlements and shelter development .  
Stimulating national and local economies , through enabling competitive and sustainable economic development that will attract public and international financial resources and private investments , generate employment and increase revenues , providing a stronger financial base to support shelter and human settlements development ;  
The international community , including multilateral financial institutions , has an important role to play in providing additional resources to reinforce national efforts to foster an enabling environment so as to achieve the objectives of adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of human settlements .  
These approaches and frameworks should also include new and improved forms of cooperation and coordination between and among multilateral financial institutions , international organizations , and various organs and bodies of the United Nations system , including South-South , North-South and South-North exchanges of best practices , and the continuous development of tools and instruments for policy , planning and management such as the application of shelter and urban indicators , human resources development and institutional capacity-building . 145 bis .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support sustainable human settlements development .  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development among multilateral and bilateral donors and mobilizing their support for national , subregional and regional plans of action of developing countries , especially for interested beneficiary countries ;  
Achieving the agreed targets of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance , and 0.15 per cent of gross national product for assistance to the least developed countries , as soon as possible , and not later than the year 2000 , and increasing the share of funding for adequate shelter and human settlement development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Encouraging multilateral development institutions and donors to support nations in their effort to pursue enabling strategies through which national and local governments , communities and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in shelter and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Inviting multilateral and bilateral donors to support countries , particularly developing countries , in their efforts to pursue enabling strategies through which governments , local authorities , communities , and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in the provision of adequate shelter , including social housing and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Striving to enhance the effectiveness of existing official development assistance and other external financial flows through improving coordination between and among donors and the United Nations operational activities , and through better coherence between those flows and internal sustainable human settlements strategies ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
Developing innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for human settlements development and creating a supportive environment for the mobilization of resources by civil society , including beneficiary and individual voluntary contributions ;  
Implementing the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of human settlements in the small island developing States , in particular by providing effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for human settlements programmes , in accordance with the Declaration of Barbados and on the basis of relevant provisions of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
There is a need for a better coordinated institutional approach to provide comprehensive scientific , technical and economic assessments of the major human activities contributing to atmospheric modification .  
The resources available for applied climate science are already far from adequate and the increased involvement of the socio-economic research community in developing and understanding human influences on atmospheric processes is expected to call for substantial increase in funding over the next decade .  
Harvesting of priority products , especially in developed countries , was frequently combined with the provision of selected environmental services ( notably maintenance of the biological resource base , including the wildlife and the conservation of soil and water ) and , with efforts to enhance recreation and aesthetic values of forests and woodlands for an increasingly urbanized human population .  
The FAO / ITTO Expert Meeting noted that , among others , arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and the Near East had not received attention under the international initiatives related to the identification of criteria and indicators ; and that the environmental conditions and socio-economic needs governing forest management in these areas in which forestry played an essential role in the survival and sustenance of local human populations , was likely to require special , complementary or additional considerations not evident in ongoing initiatives .  
The low priority assigned to forestry in national development plans results in low budget allocations in comparison to needs , and is reflected in lack of technical capability , human resources , extension facilities , basic data / information , and administrative efficiency . 
Unique or rare forest ecosystems that are not comprised of significant numbers of endemic species are more likely to be found in areas that previously had more continuous forest cover but in which forest cover has been fragmented and reduced relatively recently ( in evolutionary terms ) by climatic change , human influence or a combination of the two .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
In obtaining evidence for the verification of this commitment , the Mission faces the persistence , characteristic of Guatemala , of large numbers of homicides , death threats , kidnappings and other serious crimes which , because they are committed by ordinary criminals or unidentified persons , are not recorded as human rights violations which are directly attributable to agents of the State or politically motivated , but are nevertheless a result of the State 's failure in its duty to provide guarantees and to prevent , investigate and punish crime . 
Experience has served to design a comprehensive project for the dissemination of and education in human and indigenous rights , through integrated mass public information campaigns that use media and messages tailored to the population 's socio-economic and cultural context and give particular importance to the multi-ethnic nature of Guatemala .  
Threats and intimidation continued to be directed against individuals and entities working for the protection of human rights by CVDC members and former military commissioners in rural areas and by unidentified groups operating in urban areas .  
Although only the Government can put most of these commitments into effect , URNG , in addition to recognizing the need to put an end to the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , also undertook , inter alia , " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " ( Comprehensive Agreement , fourth preambular paragraph ) .  
Encourages the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to request the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 8 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-second session ;  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to ensure , from within existing resources , that the revision of the United Nations Manual on Human Rights Reporting is completed as soon as possible , that the revised manual is available in all official languages at the earliest opportunity and that due regard is paid to the recommendations concerning the manual made by the fifth meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies ;  
Considering that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;  
Now , after the incidents , we hear expressions of regret for the loss of human lives , but the painful reality is that , at a time when the pirate air incursions could have been discouraged , prohibited and stopped by those capable of doing so , the repeated warnings were ignored , and some quarters even applauded these irresponsible adventures .  
Welcoming the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
They reflect a recognition of the need to move away from the treatment of fields of international law ( relating , for example , to human rights , economic relations , environmental protection ) as being self-contained , towards the development of general rules of international law in which those separate fields retain their distinct character but are subject to an interconnected approach .  
This continuing rise in anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases poses potentially substantial risks to global physical and ecological systems , human health and socio-economic sectors .  
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in section V .  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
The Centre is developing a technical assistance and advisory programme aimed at assisting China in building the necessary administrative and legal structures in the area of criminal law and criminal justice in accordance with democratic principles and respect for human rights .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and , in some cases , inadequate access to technologies , may all hinder implementation and compliance .  
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
The Assembly , concerned by the continuing reports of grave abuses committed against these women migrant workers , which impair or nullify their enjoyment of their human rights , requested the inter-agency meeting preceding the regular session of the Commission on the Status of Women to consider this problem .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Recalling further that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Also urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Recalling further the pertinent resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights condemning the flagrant violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , including its most recent , resolution 1995 / 76 of 8 March 1995 , [ 4 ] / by which the Commission extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq for a further year and requested him to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session and a final report to the Commission at its fifty-second session ,  
In this programme the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa ( UNU / INRA ) addresses the continent 's urgent needs for human resources development and institutional capacity-building in order to achieve more effective conservation , management and rational utilization of natural resources for sustainable development .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
The report will highlight important findings announced at the London meeting , viz . , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominantly cereal diets of most developing countries .  
Welcoming the results of the first Round-Table Conference of Donors , held at Brussels from 25 to 27 September 1995 , conducted in a spirit of reconciliation and intended to mobilize funds for the Community Rehabilitation and National Reconciliation Programme , and aware of the important role to be played by the international community in assisting Angola in rehabilitating its economy and its basic and social infrastructures , as well as the development of human resources ,  
Considering that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
The specific topics under the theme " Capacity-building in public administration " were the enhancement of policy development capacity , organizational strengthening , improved civil service systems , the strengthening of financial management for development , human resource development for the public sector , and the development of administrative capacities for post-conflict and crisis conditions .  
For nearly 50 years , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has actively supported technical cooperation areas of administrative restructuring and reform , human resource development , institutional building in training areas , resource mobilization , financial management and the improved performance of public enterprises .  
From 1980 emphasis has been placed on the role of the public sector in promoting the economic development of developing countries , with auxiliary activities concentrating on the role of qualified national personnel in the social and economic development of developing countries , and specialized topics such as the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade , the development of human resources , or United Nations programmes of action for African economic recovery and development .  
In seeking a common standard of achievement for all people and all countries in the area of human rights , the World Conference on Human Rights , held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 , called upon all nations , regions and the international community to create favourable conditions for and effective enjoyment of basic human rights .  
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .  
In order to strengthen institutional capacity-building and human resource development in the public sector , developing countries and countries with economies in transition should avail themselves of the mechanisms of technical cooperation among developing countries and of triangular cooperation , in which developed countries and international organizations should play a catalytic role .  
The immediate strategy would include the assessment of national absorptive capacities , human and capital ; the definition of policy issues and drafting of national policies ; the restructuring and operation of key ministries for implementation of the defined policies ; the restoration of management systems and tools ( e.g . , personnel , audit , information ) ; the restoration and management of justice and public safety systems ; the retention and enlistment of professional human resources ; and the provision of crash training and retraining programmes .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
Also gravely concerned at reports , including by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; forced displacement of persons ; enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; and denial of the freedoms of expression , association and peaceful assembly ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Recognizing further that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
13 Insufficient human and financial resources and limited administrative capacities and logistical infrastructure contributed to the low absorptive capacity characteristic of several States of the region , and to a level of activities lower than that envisaged by UNDCP .  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
As the Mission approaches full deployment and with the operations of the logistic support service contract , emphasis was given to the strengthening of selected areas of administration and integrated support services to ensure optimum efficiency in the utilization of human resources and the timely provision of services to military and civilian personnel .  
The course covers the protection of the human rights of women in all pertinent areas , encompassing civil , political , economic and social rights , as well as relevant issues of humanitarian law .  
The Council recognized that it continued to be a widespread international activity frequently involving highly organized international syndicates that trafficked in human cargo without regard to the dangerous and inhumane conditions to which they were subjected , and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards .  
Reaffirming General Assembly resolutions 50 / 173 of 22 December 1995 on the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education , 1995-2004 , and 49 / 184 of 23 December 1994 , in which the Assembly expressed the conviction that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social [ and of the right to development ] , 5 ter preambular paragraph .  
The Commission should be provided with a mandate under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations enabling it to carry out a thorough investigation and receive the full cooperation of members of the international community implicated in alleged violations of the embargo , so as to send a strong signal to all arms dealers of the world and their governmental supporters that they can not supply arms to a genocidal organization benefiting from the abuse of human rights with impunity ;  
The Governments recognized the sovereign right and legitimate interest of each country to safeguard its boundaries and to enforce its own immigration laws , always observing strict respect for the human rights of the migrants , as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and other relevant international instruments , irrespective of their nationality , race , age , religion , sex or immigration status . 
Using the vision of sustainable human development contained in the Five Goals of the National Constitution as the framework for its work , the mission analysed the major environment and development issues facing Papua New Guinea under the three broad headings of enabling government , managing Papua New Guinea 's resources and empowering people for effective participation and integral human development .  
The Governing Council of UNDP , at its thirty-eighth session ( 1991 ) , adopted comprehensive legislation , in keeping with General Assembly resolution 44 / 211 on the comprehensive triennial policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , that put forth new initiatives relating to the national execution of technical cooperation activities , and the development of projects according to an integrated and prioritized national programme , and placed renewed emphasis on human development and capacity-building in development activities .  
It is understandable that the restoration of such confidence may be impeded by the deep wounds and distrust left by the conflict at the individual human level as well as by current political calculations .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
We consider such blockade and closure as tantamount to the declaration of a state of war against the Palestinian people , a people that have chosen the road of peace but that for more than a month have been subjected to the worst and most unjust form of collective punishment , to say nothing of the starvation of children , women and the elderly and contempt for basic rights that should be respected in the same manner as human rights in all countries of the world . 
In conveying to you once again our pride in and deep appreciation for your dedicated and constructive efforts and the conspicuous and honourable positions you have taken in support of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people , I am hopeful that your worthy endeavours will be crowned with success so that we may achieve the desired peace based on justice , equality and respect for human rights . 
These policy options will endeavour to link land and water management issues ; water for food security ; and safe drinking water supply , sanitation and sewerage and human health in the context of economic and social development .  NULLThe report will be supplemented by commissioned studies on the economic aspects of sustainable water resources development and use and gender issues , as well as a study on the relationship between water resources and growing urbanization and a study on cooperative approaches to the development of shared river basins .  
The two strategies followed by Mexico in this field were as follows : ( a ) establishing channels for communication of intelligence and information that would make it possible to expand the knowledge base in each country and to enhance the process of communication with countries that possessed more advanced techniques ; and ( b ) international cooperation in combating criminal activities that frustrated the efforts of Governments to fulfil their commitment to promote human rights , fundamental freedoms and democratic decision-making .  
The transportation sector is of considerable interest not only because of its importance as a source of greenhouse gas emissions but also because of the effects on human health and the environment associated with other pollutants and a number of other issues , such as traffic accidents , congestion , noise , impeded access to cities , competition for land use and restricted access of the poor to basic services - problems that are of increasing importance in developing countries .  
Full account had to be taken of economic conditions ; social , ethnic , cultural , religious or legal situations ; conjugal circumstances ; the nature and type of relations characterized by violence ; and conditions of political persecution , social oppression , racial discrimination and unequal economic development , as well as violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
50 To this definition , the Platform for Action additionally includes the violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , in particular , murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; forced sterilization and forced abortion , coercive / forced use of contraceptives , female infanticide and prenatal sex selection .  
To the extent that hazardous wastes exported to developing countries result in the contamination of soil and adjacent waters , they may reduce future productivity and economic uses of those natural resources , besides endangering human , animal and plant life .  
Stressing the importance of an efficient and effective public sector as the basic framework for stable and sustainable institutional and human development in all countries ,  
Invites the international community to recognize the importance of the role of public administration and governance in sustainable human development and the maintenance of peace and stability , and to provide adequate resources for programmes of assistance for improving public administration in developing countries , countries with economies in transition and countries facing special circumstances ;  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 137 on human rights in the administration of justice , called attention to such standards and norms , and recommended that the establishment of a comprehensive programme within the system of advisory services and technical assistance be considered in order to help States in the task of building and strengthening adequate national structures that had a direct impact on the overall observance of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law .  
The proper functioning of the law enforcement agencies is essential not only to an effective criminal justice policy , but also to the underlying premise of the protection of the fundamental human rights of individuals .  
Member States were invited to accord priority to the practical implementation of standards relating to human rights in the administration of justice , to incorporate into their national legislation and practice existing standards in this field , to design realistic and effective mechanisms for the full implementation of those standards , and to provide the necessary administrative and judicial structures for their continuous monitoring .  
The Police Congress , which was attended by representatives of 33 police agencies from 27 countries , included debates on the following topics : ( a ) human resources , a competitive advantage in modern police operations ; ( b ) economic crime ; ( c ) terrorism : a strategy for its neutralization ; ( d ) information : its positive and / or negative effect on security and crime ; and ( e ) drug abuse and its incidence among children and youth .  
It stressed the need to assist States in the task of building and strengthening adequate structures through technical assistance to national projects in reforming penal and correctional establishments , in education and training of lawyers , judges and security forces in human rights , and in other specific spheres of activity relevant to the good functioning of the rule of law .  
96 Paragraph 233 ( d ) calls upon Governments and non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and other institutional organizations , to include , as appropriate , " information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected " .  
According to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , the term " discrimination against women " is used to denote all forms of discrimination , deprivation and restriction that prevents or eliminates or aims to prevent or eliminate the recognition , utilization and benefiting of women from all political , economic , social , cultural , civil and other fundamental rights and freedoms of human beings as based on the equality of the sexes and regardless of their civil status .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Unless a new agricultural revolution is envisaged in the near future that would radically reduce the amount of water consumed in food production in hot countries ( currently about 3,000 cubic metres per ton of grain produced ) , it must be acknowledged as an urgent matter that there seems to be a definite limit to the human population that can be supported by the available water-supply . 
The mission further recommended that Member States should be encouraged to support intensive and sustained efforts to develop a broad-based and independent media in Burundi as an essential complement to diplomatic , humanitarian , human rights and development efforts already under way .  
The Board recognizes that the transportation and provision of controlled drugs needed for humanitarian aid in acute emergencies of natural or human origin constitute a genuine justification for non-application of the normal , regular control requirements .  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .  The above included reports on population , urbanization and quality of life ; strengthening of regional activities ; urban and housing indicators ; building materials and health ; and human settlements and environmental strategies .  
Special attention was given to the building and effective utilization of critical human , institutional and infrastructural capacities , particularly in the production , trade , monetary and financial , and physical infrastructure fields , as well as for the enhancement of public and private sector development and management .  
A reorientation of the activities of the human settlements sector , which resulted in major changes leading to the consolidation and reduction of activities relating to technical aspects of human settlements , which were addressed in the past , in favour of activities that better complement other activities undertaken by the three other leading sections responsible for the implementation of activities that focus more on improving the quality of life from several angles ;  
To create awareness of emerging human settlement policy issues arising from major global economic , social and environmental trends , in particular those arising from urbanization through the dissemination of successful and promising practices ;  
To strengthen international cooperation in the development and implementation of human settlement policies striving towards environmental , economic and social soundness and sustainable development ; monitor and analyse results in the implementation process ; coordinate those policies with overall national sustainable development objectives ; and build institutional capacity and professional know-how ;  
To identify new and emerging trends in the ecological , economic , social , technical and legislative spheres that influence sustainable human settlements development in the ECE region ;  
Notwithstanding the fact that issues pertaining to the improvement of the quality of life are indivisible and interdependent and will , therefore , be addressed in an interdisciplinary manner in so far as possible , the subprogramme , which is implemented by the Social Development Issues and Policies Division , will seek to achieve objectives related to four specific yet complementary areas pertaining to the improvement of the quality of life : population , human development , advancement of women and human settlements .  
While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
The abuse of drugs and alcohol is an intrinsic threat to such basic goals as economic and social well-being , fundamental human rights and social justice , constructive development , adequate employment and satisfactory conditions of work and pay .  
Society 's assigned roles and perceptions also play a part in the way men and women are involved in illicit trafficking ; are vulnerable to punitive actions from the law enforcement sectors ; are subject to human rights violations ; and are perceived in the community .  
Promoting effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
To that end , the objective is to enhance the capability of the Governments of the region to formulate and implement policies and actions to strengthen the technological dimension of productive activities , increase competitiveness , eliminate bottlenecks in the key factor markets - mainly in the area of human resources , physical capital and export promotion policies - and stimulate entrepreneurial development ;  
The objective is to contribute towards a better understanding of the conditions and trends in human settlements in the region and to support countries in establishing balanced and integrated human settlement systems , improving housing , infrastructure and services and instituting proper management of the urban process .  
The tasks identified by the Secretary-General included availability and management of water , sustainable food security , capacity - building for governance , social and human development and mobilization of external and internal financial resources for African development .  
For the underprivileged of the world , there is greater awareness of the situation in the developed countries , resulting in raised aspirations and calls in global forums for goals and standards regarding increased prosperity , a secure and healthy life , human rights , social justice and gender equality . 
An appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies , a well-developed infrastructure , strengthened institutions and capacity , as well as meeting basic human needs such as shelter , and providing social welfare , were recognized as key factors for addressing the poverty problem .  
The representative of the Centre explained the primary goal and objectives of the five-year project : to help the organization better meet the current and diverse demands placed on it in matters relating to peace and security and humanitarian and human rights affairs ; to help the United Nations system to meet the new and dramatic challenges of the future ; to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the system partners ; and to help the United Nations organization to meet the calls for reform , accountability and flexibility .  
The Acting Director noted that this limited the Institute 's ability to provide the other main committees of the General Assembly with substantive contributions and conclusions derived from its research in crucial areas of economic and social development , such as water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , alleviation of poverty , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
The overall orientation of the programme , which is under the responsibility of the Department for Development Support and Management Services , is to enhance and support , through technical cooperation , the national efforts of Member States , in particular developing countries and the least developed among them , as well as economies in transition , to build their human and institutional capabilities and infrastructures to formulate and effectively implement economic and social policies that will contribute to sustainable , people-centred development and the eradication of poverty .  
To assist Governments , at their request , in strengthening their capacity for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , human resources development and public administration training ; improving performance in the public sector ; increasing public / private sector interaction ; managing development programmes ; and enhancing government legal capacity ;  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
The organization shall be concerned with matters falling within the competence of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies with respect to international economic , social , environmental , cultural , educational , health , scientific , technological and related matters and to humanitarian and human rights questions .  
The course covers human rights protection of women in all pertinent areas , thus encompassing civil and political and economic and social rights , as well as relevant issues relating to humanitarian law .  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
The programme is based on the principles of the Vienna Declaration , including the principle that democracy , development and respect for human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated and must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , universally , objectively and non-selectively .  
A significant enhancement and strengthening of international cooperation in the field of human rights leading to increased effectiveness of international machinery , improved respect of human rights at the national level , through , inter alia , universal ratification of basic international human rights treaties and the incorporation of those standards into the domestic legislation of States ;  
At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that the concept of development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional undertaking with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition .  
We , the Heads of State or Government and the official delegations of countries assembled at the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in Istanbul , Turkey from 3 to 14 June 1996 , take this opportunity to endorse the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more livable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
Our deliberations on the two major themes of the Conference - adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world - have been inspired by the Charter of the United Nations and are aimed at reaffirming existing and forging new partnerships for action at the international , national and local levels to improve our living environment .  
To this end , we commit ourselves to improving the living conditions in human settlements in ways that are consonant with local needs and realities , and we acknowledge the need to address the global , economic , social and environmental trends to ensure the creation of better living environments for all people . 
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .  
The agreement represents a model for national reconciliation ; it offers the prospect of building a pluralistic democratic society with high standards in the sphere of the human rights and equal participation of all political and regional forces in the public life of the country .  
In order to support the new global and integrated approach to human rights based on the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which emphasized the interrelated and interdependent nature of all human rights , it will be necessary to organize both short-term and long-term training in the various dimensions of human rights to ensure that all staff and those joining the Programme enjoy a broad knowledge of human rights from the United Nations perspective .  
Technical advisory services were provided by the Group on a variety of development issues , covering such areas as : inland water transport ; subregional cooperation for lake basin development ; implementation of the African Platform for Action on Women ; formulation of development priorities , programmes and projects ; economic cooperation and integration ; human resources development and utilization , and energy development ; criminal justice and crime prevention ; mineral resources and development ; agricultural development ; rural development ; industrial development ; and science and technology development . 
Furthermore , ESCWA published the biennial demographic and related socio-economic indicators on human development and socio-cultural specificity - the case of the Arab world ; the social dimensions of human development ; the situation of disabled women , their marginalization , and measures for social integration in the ESCWA region ; changing values in the Arab family ; and regional perspectives of human settlements in ESCWA countries .  
A more systematic and sustained process of building and nurturing national human and institutional capacities is required , tailored to each country 's strengths and weaknesses , to help integrate the different dimensions of development , including that of economic and social rights , and to design , manage and execute complex programmes and projects .  
In the first half of 1996 , more than 550 policemen received training in the following areas : advanced driving , basic forensic science , drug law enforcement , human rights , maintenance of public order , management development and training , and management training for traffic police and women police management .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
The humanitarian community will have to consider how it will relate in the future to global economic and social adjustments , to environmental and ecological concerns , and to human rights .  
According to both foreign observers and residents , the leading causes of continuing lawlessness in the region are the lack of an adequate professional police presence and the Croatian authorities ' unwillingness to take firm preventive action against human rights violators .  
The figures provided by the Government are thus unclear on the specific issue raised by the Security Council in its presidential statement of 23 February 1996 , namely , the issue of prosecutions against those suspected of past violations of international humanitarian law and human rights against the local Serb minority . 
This high level of attrition at a stage when continuing learning is both optimal and desirable represents , from an educational and manpower planning perspective , a wasted national opportunity to expand and strengthen the human resource pool for the enhancement of national productivity .  
The Counsel for Human Rights , with support from the Mission , has elaborated a work plan for his programme on behalf of indigenous peoples which seeks to : ( a ) put an end to discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples and individuals ; ( b ) guarantee the practical enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and ( c ) promote respect for and recognition and promotion of the historical and specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
Notwithstanding the above , the Government 's compliance with the commitment to supporting and strengthening institutions for the protection of human rights is still highly inadequate , as shown by the absence or weak presence of such institutions in wide areas of the country and the fact that the bodies responsible for implementing this commitment lack a comprehensive policy in criminal matters .  
The Mission is deeply concerned at the continuation of this practice , which , given the army 's historic influence over such committees , undermines the primacy of civilian authority and also affects the human rights situation , in that members of the voluntary civil defence committees and former military commissioners are implicated in numerous complaints of human rights violations .  
The Mission considers that the deterioration of the conditions in which defendants are held pending trial , and the lengthening of sentences , could have a generalized adverse impact on the protection of individuals against the arbitrary use of State power , while paradoxically failing to achieve the declared aim of protecting the human rights of crime victims .  
Adopt , within its sphere of competence , a set of measures to enable the Public Prosecutor 's Office to play the role assigned to it , with a view to : ( i ) establishing hierarchical supervision over the National Police and other security forces ; ( ii ) preventing interference from other State entities in the Office 's work ; ( iii ) providing the necessary institutional support to prosecutors who are responsible for cases involving human rights violations ; and ( iv ) protecting the physical integrity of the Office 's personnel ;

UNDP has defined the conditions for success to include : shared ethical values established , communicated and practised ; human resource policies and practices that are consistent with values and objectives ; authority , responsibility and accountability defined and consistent with objectives ; and the creation of an atmosphere of mutual trust at all levels of the organization .  
With regard to the religious and ethnic violence prompted by the failure of the Indonesian Government to resolve the social , political and economic issues that lay at the heart of the human rights problems , three major riots had taken place in 1995 .  The first and last had been sparked by deliberate acts of incitement against Catholicism , the dominant religion in East Timor .  
The attending Heads of State and Government had received a delegation of the Coordinating Committee of the Diplomatic Front for Timorese Resistance and had reiterated that they were ready to promote concerted action to guarantee respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in East Timor and a just , comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution that would achieve respect for the legitimate rights and aspirations of its people in conformity with international law .  
The European Union is of the view that these objectives are attainable through a strengthened political dialogue to be held on a regular basis , through the development of financial and economic cooperation and by granting a more important role to the social , human and cultural dimensions of this dialogue .  
When confronted with the task of placing the importance of the two questions in proper perspective , it is obvious to us that human life is the supreme value which we must protect , just as we must protect the security of civil aviation in this case , by defending and reiterating the applicable norms of international law .  
These incursive and cruel activities which resulted in numerous human casualties and material damages to civilian population constitute a grave violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran .  
This inspiring philosophy required a holistic institution : an organization mandated with responsibility for distinct yet interconnected areas of human activity and the safeguard of agreed and fundamental principles of international behaviour .  
In view of the small size constraint faced by many island developing countries , special efforts should be made to promote regional cooperation arrangements that offer a viable framework for realizing economies of scale in various economic activities , particularly with regard to resource exploitation , protection and policing of coast lines and exclusive economic zones , environmental protection , market access , development and sharing of human resources , expansion of inter-island feeder services , tourism development and exchange of information on successes and failures in various areas of development .  
This was a joint effort of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and UNIFEM . It includes information on women and human rights , women and political participation , gender-based violence , women and armed conflict , reproductive rights and sexual rights , culture and traditional practices , the girl child , women 's rights in relation to children 's rights , and legal status versus legal reality . 
The report highlights important findings announced at the London meeting , namely , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominately cereal diets of most developing countries .  
A training programme for members of human rights organizations included short seminars on human rights investigation , forensic anthropology and judicial reform , as well as a two-week intensive course on various aspects of human rights work .  Seminars for journalists were held in all Haiti 's principal towns .  
A major regional project covering 26 countries in eastern Europe and CIS was launched in 1995 and executed by ECE to assist national statistical offices in developing the human resources necessary for building self-sustainable capabilities for the collection , processing and analysis of reliable social and demographic statistics , and enabling the appropriate governmental institutions and agencies of these countries to monitor the social aspects of development .  
The proposed medium-term plan for the period 1998-2001 reflects the following priorities : maintenance of peace and security , promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective response to humanitarian emergencies ; and promotion of justice and international law .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
The human rights situation in Burundi is characterized by large-scale massacres involving both State agents and rebels ; selective murders of intellectuals , political leaders , provincial officials and Hutu merchants , as well as certain Tutsi military officers alleged to be moderates ; arbitrary arrests ; and enforced disappearances .  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious intercommunity relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , [ in the framework of their beliefs ] * Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women and the girl child . 
We agree to support ongoing and new creative partnerships , recognizing that indigenous people , youth and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups possess in common the potential for diverse realization of full human development .  
In the spirit of cooperative linkages for joint exploration of human potentials , we agree to focus on partnership actions that clarify , interpret , create , protect and promote socio-legal , political , economic , educational , cultural , moral and spiritual processes affecting the abilities of indigenous people and youth to choose , maintain , access , encourage , manage and actualize their diverse ways of achieving just and humane growth and development .  
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
No one fully knows how deep and friendly are the relations that link the Egyptian people with the Sudanese people : their ties are as old as the Nile , are enhanced by geographical proximity , neighbourly relations , a common language , the similarity of their social customs and the human relations between the two peoples in the Nile valley since time immemorial .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Massive or persistent violations of human rights , often the result of ethnic , racial or religious tensions or unequal access to power and basic necessities of life will continue to endanger international peace and security and to hamper economic and social development .  
Although Africa is faced with enormous problems , it also has a great potential , both in human and natural resources , for sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
The accords , commitments and internationally agreed targets reached at United Nations global conferences and United Nations organs , in the multifaceted and interrelated issues of the environment , population , social development , crime , the advancement of women , human settlements , trade and development and public administration should be fully implemented by all States and international organizations .  
In the United Nations human rights programme of assistance , priority will be given to establishing criteria and implementing procedures for promoting economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , to exploring the root causes of human rights violations , to protecting the rights of persons who can be particularly vulnerable to abuse or neglect , including youth , persons with disabilities , the elderly and migrant workers .  
The United Nations will promote necessary measures to strengthen laws , policies and programmes that would ensure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life as equal partners and the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all women .  
The objectives of the review were to determine whether the management structure of the civilian component was appropriate in providing the necessary support service to UNPF , to assess the adequacy of management systems and internal controls and to ascertain whether the use of United Nations resources ( human , physical and financial ) was adequately planned , organized , directed and monitored , and whether value for money was achieved .  
Welcoming also the continued efforts by States to provide humanitarian assistance and technical cooperation to the people of Haiti , Supporting fully the contribution of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti and the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti in the establishment of a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the full observance of human rights and the full restoration of the constitutional democracy of Haiti , and encouraging the International Civilian Mission to continue to cooperate with the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti and others participating in institution-building , including police training activities ,

In the face of this paralysing economic strangulation , decreed unilaterally by our neighbours , which should be cultivating natural human solidarity more than ever with a Burundi immersed in a state of distress , we are once again threatened with genocide , the causes of which everyone is seeking to eradicate , but which could re-emerge owing to those measures that run counter to legal and humanitarian principles .  
Likewise , it is essential to study , starting now , all the necessary modalities for resuming development aid once peace , national reconciliation , democracy and strict respect for human rights have become established and have finally triumphed , both in the thinking and in the conduct of all the citizens of Burundi , who will finally be brought together and will coalesce into a single , unified nation .  
In this regard , on Friday , 23 August , the Government published a statement in which it invites the entire international community , starting with Amnesty International , to immediately begin investigations of this monstrous allegation by the representative of Amnesty International in Burundi .  Today I received a copy of a message sent by the Government of Burundi to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , inviting them to increase the number of human rights observers , since the current Government ,  
During its sixteenth session , in January 1996 , the Council decided to give priority , in its future activities , to regional and subregional projects , and reaffirmed its support of projects aiming , in particular at improving the quality of communication for development ; promoting freedom of the press , pluralism and independence of the media ; promoting democracy and human rights ; supporting activities for broader participation of women in the media ; and developing community media etc .  
In another sense , however , the distinction between relief and rehabilitation assistance in Somalia is becoming increasingly blurred , as the main underlying causes of human suffering and emergency needs remain the population 's lack of purchasing power and employment opportunities combined with the absence of civil and social infrastructure and institutions of governance .  
Drug abuse has devastating social effects , including its harmful impact on youth , families , other social groups and the workplace , and adverse health consequences as well , including those resulting from the relationship between substance abuse and a number of major diseases and disorders and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) .  
The Conference also decided that in the area of international trade , the UNCTAD technical cooperation programme should focus , inter alia , on enhancing institutional and human capacities in order for developing countries to analyse new and emerging issues and to benefit from the opportunities arising from participation in the multilateral trading system and to comply with the obligations in this respect .  
The programme on education for peace , human rights , democracy and international understanding provided a meaningful contribution to the struggle against terrorism inasmuch as it promoted thinking and behaviour based on common humanistic and cultural values .  
Difficulties developed and delays again occurred in a number of areas , including the institutional consolidation of the public security sector ; the adoption of legal and constitutional reforms ; the reform of the judicial and electoral systems ; the transfer of land to former combatants ; and the transfer of rural human settlements to their current occupants .  
In Costa Rica , it has assisted in the promotion of a national policy for the training of local administrators , specifically in financial management , as well as facilitating the creation of a Metropolitan Council for the City of San Jos ; and has supported the " State of the Nation " initiative , consisting of a participatory scheme to produce an annual report of the country 's sustainable human development performance and its most significant challenges .

In view of the politico-economic environment in which well over half the 1995 expenditure was incurred , it is still considered that the additional resources , both human and financial , which would be required to analyse and forecast the inflation and exchange rate variation factors with any degree of reliability would be costly to UNHCR , the degree of reliability would most probably not be reached , and the added value to UNHCR would most probably be minimal .  
It has maintained close relations with the administrative , judicial and military authorities at local and national levels , and has reported its assessment of the human rights situation to the Government on a regular basis .  
In recent experience , some peacekeeping operations have been mandated to include different combinations of the following tasks : monitoring of cease-fires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , demining , establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
" The use of chemicals is essential to protect public health and increase food production , but unregulated use of toxic chemicals or uncontrolled disposal of hazardous wastes threaten the environment and human health " In the second sentence , before the words " monitor and assess global trends " insert the words " through the work of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal , " ;  
Some delegations felt that the development of new norms and new standards and instruments mentioned in paragraphs 19.2 and 19.3 ( n ) was not an appropriate goal , and that the universal ratification of basic international human rights treaties mentioned in paragraph 19.3 ( a ) represented goals which were too ambitious and difficult to be realized during the plan period .  
The objective of eradicating absolute poverty required a broad range of policies and actions at all levels : an appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies ; a well-developed infrastructure ; strengthened institutions and capacity ; as well as programmes designed to meet basic human needs ;  
The project will assist Governments and regional institutions in strengthening capability for monitoring and analysing climate and sea level trends ; identify areas vulnerable to the effects of climate change and sea level rise ; develop an integrated management and planning framework ; enhance regional and national capabilities through human resource development and institutional strengthening ; identify and assess policy operations and instruments ; and collect information for preparing national communications .  
This series of global conferences have proved invaluable in raising awareness of human and environmental conditions around the world and in enjoining national Governments and the international community to act to improve those conditions .  
Having set out , in a number of principles and commitments , guidelines for making settlements healthier , safer , more humane and sustainable , the Habitat Agenda then proposes a comprehensive set of objectives and actions , based on two themes : ( a ) adequate shelter for all and ( b ) sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
On the basis of an analysis of existing national plans , the broadest demand for technical assistance and cooperation in the follow-up to Habitat II is likely to be in institutional development , capacity-building and facilitation / enablement , with emphasis on the following components of effective governance for sustainable human settlements : legal frameworks and institutional structures , consultative and participatory processes , research and policy development , planning processes , management systems , financing modalities , training systems , information systems , communication networks , and technology transfer processes .  
It will be recalled that , following the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements , held in Vancouver , British Columbia , in 1976 , and deriving from its recommendations , a consensus developed on the need for institutional arrangements to provide a focal point within the United Nations system to promote and support a concerted and systematic effort by the international community for human settlements development .  
Noting the intention of the Secretary-General to ensure effective coordination of the implementation of the Habitat Agenda and adequate consideration of human settlements needs in all activities of the United Nations system , and to include the implementation of the Habitat Agenda in the agenda of the ACC machinery , and in the mandates of the thematic task forces that are promoting an integrated and coordinated follow-up , at the inter-agency level , of the outcomes of recent global conferences .  I , resolution 1 , annex II .  
The proposed project is also concerned with achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable social and human development ; reproductive health including family planning and sexual health ; and gender sensitivity and women 's empowerment .  
The Special Rapporteur has maintained and continues to maintain that mercenaries exist ; that they are not a small number of individuals ; that they are groups of professionals selling their skill in war and violence ; that they are also criminal organizations , an international blight in their perpetration of acts of violence which ruin human lives , create material losses , hamper economic activity and extend to terrorist attacks that have touched off or aggravated conflicts , with often catastrophic results for the peoples affected by them . 
The following thematic areas were considered at the meeting : ( a ) policy development capacity and administrative restructuring , civil service reform and management training ; ( b ) financial management ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) public-private interaction ; ( e ) public sector efficiency ; ( f ) social development ; ( g ) infrastructure and the environment ; ( h ) legal and regulatory framework ; ( i ) post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery ; and ( j ) management of development programmes .  
In accordance with Council resolution 1985 / 17 , the Committee has 18 members who are experts with recognized competence in the field of human rights , serving in their personal capacity , due consideration being given to equitable geographical distribution and to the representation of different forms of social and legal systems ; to this end , 15 seats are equally distributed among the regional groups , while the additional 3 seats are allocated in accordance with the increase in the total number of States parties per regional group .  
To promote awareness , both in developed and in developing countries , of the social , economic and environmental implications of national and international population problems , of the human rights aspects of family planning , and of possible strategies to deal with them , in accordance with the plans and priorities of each country ;  
Considering the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations calling , inter alia , for the promotion of international cooperation in solving problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms ,  
In fact , his real reasons for presenting such a report are political , and completely unrelated to human rights issues ; rather , they are connected with the conspiracy to divide Iraq by imposing the no-fly zones in the north and the south of the country .  
Van der Stoel attempts to invoke the issue of missing Kuwaitis for obvious political purposes unrelated to human rights with a view to the continued exercise of pressure on the Government of Iraq and prolongation of the economic embargo and hence the suffering of the Iraqi people .  
Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations . [ 1 ] / United Nations , Treaty Series , vol .  520 , No . 7515 .  
Danish development policy is an integral part of Danish foreign policy , in which the main objectives are , inter alia : promotion of common security , promotion of democratic government and human rights , creation of economic and social development and ensuring ecologically sustainable development .  
In addition to promoting mutual understanding and solidarity through cultural cooperation between peoples , the assistance aims at creating equal and free opportunities for the individual , in accordance with the aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , the development of human resources and the respect of the individual , as well as the creation of pluralistic civil societies .  
While all those procedural aspects are covered in a special chapter ( comprising a number of articles ) in other principal human rights treaties , in the case of the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which does not have a treaty-based standing , more than a dozen Council resolutions and decisions were needed to complement the text of the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . Owing to this special " legal " situation , a decision by the Council could terminate the Committee 's existence .  
Such an action is explicitly called for by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action 2 / which in its paragraph I . 5 reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ;  
Having reviewed the steps taken towards the implementation of General Assembly resolutions 50 / 145 and 50 / 146 , including other relevant mandates in this area , it can be concluded that the credibility of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme will be measured , to a large extent , by its ability to provide effective support to requesting countries in drafting legislation , creating independent systems for the administration of justice , establishing police forces that are respectful of the rule of law and setting up national institutions for protecting fundamental human rights .  
In this , the political leadership is also obliged to support and foster the development of both the formal human rights institutions that were established by the Peace Agreement and Federation Constitutions , and the informal non-governmental structures that are an integral part of the development of civil society .  
The political leadership now has the opportunity to ensure that , in particular through the functioning of common institutions at the national level , all three communities can work towards the consolidation of a sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law , respect for the human rights of all peoples and the development of a representative democracy .  
The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .  
It is the obligation of Governments to carry out exhaustive and impartial investigations into allegations of violations of the right to life , to identify , bring to justice and punish their perpetrators , to grant compensation to the victims or their families , and to take effective measures to avoid future recurrence of such violations .  The Special Rapporteur has noted that impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of violations of human rights , and , in particular , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
However , it would be unfair to put the rebel groups , no matter what their role in the violence has been , on the same footing as a State which has ratified the major international instruments on human rights and international humanitarian law and is therefore bound by strict obligations . 
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
In its resolution 50 / 58 K , the General Assembly expressed its concern , inter alia , that Burundi continued to face a social and political crisis , the adverse consequences of which were manifest in human rights abuses , the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and external trade and shrinking public revenue .  
Experience in countries that have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which pay attention to the distribution of income and to investment in human resources through basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved , is fundamental to the eradication of poverty .  
Violations of human rights remain extremely serious , including , in particular , the practice of torture , summary and arbitrary executions , forced labour , including forced portering for the military , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detention , forced displacement , serious restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed , in particular , at ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
Those procedures have been established on the basis of the general and implicit powers of the Commission , in the light of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations governing the promotion of universal respect for and , observance of , human rights and freedoms and in the light of the obligations deriving from the pledge given by States Members to take joint and separate action in cooperation with the organs of the United Nations to implement those principles .  
The question arises , with growing urgency , as to whether any juridical legitimacy that could , arguably , have been derived from past acquiescence in the assumption of power by the Military Forces can any longer provide a defensible basis for the continued maintenance of a non-constitutional system based on the assumption of martial powers , having such an unfavourable impact on human rights in the context of generally accepted international norms and the obligations undertaken by Myanmar .  
In conclusion , on the basis of its experiences and achievements in promoting human rights , Tunisia has been able to incorporate establishment of the rule of law in a global approach , to initiate a process of economic , social and cultural development , and to promote human rights in all their dimensions , both at the structural level and at the level of day-to-day practice and procedures . 
Although both texts have been rendered obsolete - re-educational work camps and civic service camps having long since been closed down - they were expressly abrogated by Act No . 95-9 dated 23 January 1995 - evidence of the great importance the Tunisia of the new era attaches to international labour standards , and of its desire to achieve a high degree of harmonization of its legislation with the principles inspired by those standards , and in particular those relating to fundamental human rights . 
Ensure that pupils learn a foreign language to a sufficient level to enable them to have direct access to works of universal thought , technical works , scientific theories and human values , and train them to follow developments in these areas and to contribute to them in such a way as to enrich the national culture and its interaction with the universal human culture ;  
It explains why the Tunisia of the new era has opted for a national scientific development policy targeted on the needs of Tunisian society and guaranteeing increased protection of human rights conceived as an essential condition of economic , social and cultural progress .  
Since the freedom of creative activity is regarded as a fundamental condition for the development of human rights in science and technology , the national research system , inspired by the Declaration of 7 November 1987 , has endeavoured to encourage the exercise of this freedom by means of an array of legal , administrative , jurisdictional and trade-union measures .  
In addition to the Central Analysis and Testing Laboratory , the Government has established the National Institute for Research into Physical and Chemical Analysis , in order to equip the country with suitable means of providing accurate information about the composition of a substance and ensuring efficient and effective control of the content of products brought into use , thus preventing the circulation of products having invisible effects on human or animal health or harmful effects on the environment , and with a view to the issue of international certificates of conformity .  
In addition , Tunisia 's penal system is sufficiently well developed from the standpoint of criminal legislation and juridical institutions to ensure the punishment of any use of scientific progress for purposes prejudicial to human life or individual freedom or privacy .  
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
Cancelled : ( ii ) compendium on human settlement-related interventions in the control of vector-borne diseases in urban areas ; ( iv ) strategies for environmentally sound energy management in urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa ; and ( viii ) compendium of sustainable disposal techniques for septate and pit-latrine waste .  
It would be wholly unrealistic and even irresponsible to believe that , following the 1994 genocide which claimed the lives of between 500,000 and 1-million persons and involved substantial destruction of Rwanda 's infrastructure as well as ensuing instability and violence arising from continuing insurgency and counter-insurgency operations , anything less than sustained remedial efforts can bring about long-lasting improvement in the human rights situation .  
Effective monitoring of the human rights situation coupled with comprehensive advisory and promotional activities focused on the areas of greatest and most urgent concern are required .  
Among these indicators , the following should figure : substantial and regular respect for the right to life and physical integrity exercised by public agents of the Republic of Rwanda ; effective functioning of the judicial system at all levels ; conformity of arrest and detention practices with international human rights standards ; and humane conditions of detention throughout Rwanda .  
Following consideration as to what viable alternatives might be possible , the High Commissioner created a yearly human rights fund for field activities of $ 25-million to minimize the instability and uncertainty that has complicated current field operations , and to ensure that , when called for in future , a human rights field operation could be deployed urgently , without unnecessary delay arising from financial constraints .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated the continued validity of the fundamental right of all peoples to self-determination , the exercise of which , in the case of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation , is essential to ensure the eradication of all those situations and to guarantee universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
They expressed their concern over the deterioration of the food and agriculture situation in developing countries , reaffirmed the need to achieve food security and sustainable agricultural policies as fundamental objectives of development and asserted that the right to food was a fundamental human right , the respect and promotion of which constitute a moral imperative for the international community .  
They agreed that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should jointly sponsor draft resolutions to be presented by the Group of 77 at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly on the following agenda items : trade and development , cooperation for industrial development , environment and sustainable development , human settlements , population and development , external debt crisis and development , food and sustainable agricultural development , an Agenda for Development and renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership .  
Overcoming the many years of conflict in Angola would not only be a major blessing for a country which is friendly to us , for its people and for other States in the region of southern Africa , but would also be a substantial success for the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole , which have invested significant human , material and financial resources in support of the Angolan peace process .  
The chairpersons further recommend that consideration be given to more creative approaches whereby several of the various procedural amendments to the human rights treaties could be packaged together in a single , comprehensive document to be transmitted to the States parties to allow them the option of invoking their constitutional amendment procedures only once for all the amendments .  
The Sudanese Jurists Union stands by issues and problems concerning human rights all over the world ; ( ii ) the Sudanese Jurists Union defends the oppressed and the victims of unjust verdicts or actions ; ( iii ) the Sudanese Jurists Union desires the attainment of recognition and acknowledgement from the international organizations at large , and the United Nations in particular ; ( iv ) the Sudanese Jurists Union develops and advances the legal research and seminars regarding the above concerns . "  
To give free and unimpeded access to international human rights and humanitarian organizations and independent observers to all areas where enforced or involuntary disappearances or cases of slavery , slave trade and similar institutions and practices , especially the sale of and trafficking in children and women have been reported ;  
UNESCO 's efforts through programme implementation are centred on the training of human resources in fields of vital importance for their development , such as access to mother-tongue education , revitalization of components of their cultural heritage , development of traditional skills relating to the protection and use of natural resources , promotion of crafts and encouraging systematic mechanisms of dialogue with member States . UNESCO 's policy in the area of indigenous issues is a long-term task based on regular and progressive consultation with indigenous partners .  
It was said that the forum should have a broad mandate and that it should extend beyond a narrow human rights focus to include issues such as economic , social , cultural , political , civil , educational and developmental issues as well as play a role in the coordination of all relevant United Nations activities .  
In his message , the Secretary-General pointed out that the International Decade promotes concrete action in such vital areas as human rights , protection of the environment and access to health and education - areas in which indigenous people must be actively involved ; and also referred to the efforts the United Nations system can make to enhance international cooperation and understanding on issues of central concern to the world 's indigenous people .  
It is recommended that the programme of fellowships offered by the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and certain specialized agencies to train indigenous people wishing to gain experience relevant to indigenous issues should be expanded ; and also that community-based training and educational programmes on human rights and indigenous rights should be set up , and training and technical assistance courses in project design and management should be developed .  
Despite being forced to devote a large part of its human and material resources to defending its land and people against the expansionist policies of Israel , the Syrian Arab Republic had undertaken a comprehensive and successful social development programme .  The leadership provided by the President had ensured the political stability and democratic climate necessary for broad participation in youth-related activities .  
The Plan of Action has five objectives : the assessment of needs and formulation of strategies ; building and strengthening human rights education programmes at the international , regional , national and local levels ; developing and coordinating the development of human rights education materials ; strengthening the role of the mass media ; and promoting the global dissemination of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
The High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has continued actively to seek support and engaging in a dialogue within the framework of the Decade with several international non-governmental organizations , centres and associations that organize ( often through their networks of national chapters ) international programmes for human rights education addressed to specific targets or with a regional or thematic focus .  
For human rights education not to be theoretical , but to be relevant to people 's experience and , therefore , rooted in the historical , social , psychological , ethnic , gender , linguistic and other contexts of the learners ;  
It is suggested that the focal points ' tasks should be to identify national human rights education needs and to develop a national plan of action for human rights education containing specific objectives , strategies and programmes for the enhancement of human rights education at all levels , including pre-schools , primary and secondary schools , higher education , professional schools , training programmes for public officials and non-formal learning , including general public information .  
Finally , the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities for the promotion of human rights ; details about these activities at the national , regional and global level are outlined in the report of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights ( see E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 90 ) .  
The training packages will incorporate the methodological approach mentioned in paragraph 75 of the Plan of Action , and address the following professional groups : prison officers ; primary and secondary schoolteachers ; legal professionals ( judges and lawyers ) ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; media ; and human rights monitors .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
The Declaration on Partnership underscored that there was a need to provide well-targeted and affordable social safety nets by reducing unproductive spending , while ensuring adequate basic investment in infrastructure ; that the sustainability of economic growth depended on the development of human resources ; and that it was highly desirable to reform public pensions , employment insurance , social security and health systems in order to ensure their long-term viability .  
Since then , agreements have been concluded on human rights ; the resettlement of persons displaced by the armed conflict ; the establishment of the historical clarification commission ; the identity and rights of indigenous peoples ; social and economic aspects and the agrarian situation ; and now , the strengthening of civilian power and the role of the armed forces in a democratic society .  
Together with the agreements already signed , this Agreement seeks to create the conditions for genuine reconciliation among the people of Guatemala , based upon respect for human rights and the diversity of its peoples and on their shared determination to overcome the lack of social , economic and political opportunities , which undermines democratic coexistence and restricts the development of the nation ,  
All the Guatemala peace agreements posit that a firm and lasting peace must be based on respect for human rights and for the multi-ethnic , multicultural and multilingual character of the Guatemalan nation ; national economic development with social justice ; social participation ; the conciliation of interests ; and democratic institution-building .  
The doctrine shall encompass respect for the Guatemalan Constitution , human rights , the international instruments ratified by Guatemala in the military field , protection of national sovereignty and independence , the territorial integrity of Guatemala and the spirit of the agreements on a firm and lasting peace .  
The necessary amendments shall continue to be made to the corresponding regulations so that the military education system is consistent , in its philosophical framework , with respect for the Guatemalan Constitution and other laws , with a culture of peace and democratic coexistence , with the doctrine defined in this Agreement , and with national values , the integral development of the individual , knowledge of our national history , respect for human rights and the identity and rights of the indigenous peoples , and the primacy of the individual .  
The practice of voluntary military recruitment shall be continued , until the Government of Guatemala , on the basis of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights , adopts the necessary administrative decisions , and the Guatemalan Congress approves a civil service law , which shall include military service and community service ; this law shall entail fulfilment of a duty and a constitutional right , which is neither compulsory nor a violation of human rights , is universal and non-discriminatory , and would reduce the length of service and offer options to citizens .  
A Civilian Intelligence and Information Analysis Department to be established under the Ministry of the Interior shall be responsible for obtaining information to combat organized crime and ordinary crime , utilizing the means available and acting within the limits allowable under the legal system , and shall ensure full respect for human rights .  
The ideals that inspired the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are as relevant today as they were nearly half a century ago when the community of nations pledged to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Similarly , the High Commissioner has assertively sought to secure that economic , social and cultural rights , and particularly the right to development , acquire a higher profile within the framework of United Nations human rights efforts , in the spirit of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which proclaimed that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated . 
Through dialogue with Member States , through coordination with the United Nations agencies that support human rights efforts , through permanent contact with regional forums , academic institutions and the leadership of the main international financial institutions , the High Commissioner has sought to ensure that the issue of human rights become a constant in the thinking and actions of the political and economic forces that govern or influence events globally .  
It is perceived as encompassing the principle of universality in health care , so that all human beings may live with the knowledge that they can seek health care which is accessible , affordable , relevant , and of the requisite quality .  
The overall objective , strengthening civil society , is pursued on a country-by-country , regional , interregional and global basis , through the provision of assistance to national non-governmental organizations in the form of training courses on human rights , fellowships and support of appropriate projects developed by them .  
It offers constitutional and legislative assistance ; human rights support to parliaments ; human rights training for United Nations peacekeepers ; assistance in strengthening the administration of justice ( including human rights training for the legal profession , police and prison officials ) ; assistance for the establishment of independent , effective national human rights institutions ; assistance for the conduct of free and fair elections ; and support to non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
In a statement of 23 April 1996 on the situation of human rights in Colombia , the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to proceed , upon the initiative of the Government of Colombia and the identification of adequate sources of financing , to establish at the earliest possible date a permanent office in Colombia to assist the Colombian authorities in developing policies and programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights and to observe violations of human rights in the country , making analytical reports to the High Commissioner .  
The High Commissioner / Centre maintained a close working relation with the Conference secretariat by sharing its expertise and providing background materials as well as contributions in the area of human rights and on the specific issues of forced displacement , with a view to ensuring that commitments undertaken under international human rights and humanitarian law standards were accurately reflected in the final document of the Conference . 
The right to development is related to all human rights but can not be identified with the sum of the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights or be confused with development itself .  
States , as the principal actors in the realization of the right to development , should guarantee the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms , strengthen democracy and ensure an honest and transparent public administration and an efficient and impartial administration of justice .  
Other activities also continue to receive considerable attention , such as assistance on specific human rights issues , including the implementation of comprehensive national plans of action for the promotion and protection of human rights , popular participation in decision-making and implementation of projects relating to economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
It reaffirmed that democracy and transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society were indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development and that Governments in all countries should promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , bearing in mind the interdependent and mutually reinforcing relationship between democracy , development and respect for human rights , and should make public institutions more responsive to people 's needs .  
The " policies " and " practices " affecting human rights that came within the scope of investigation by the Special Committee referred , in the case of " policies " , to any course of action consciously adopted and pursued by the Government of Israel as part of its declared or undeclared intent ; while " practices " referred to those actions which , irrespective of whether or not they were in implementation of a policy , reflected a pattern of behaviour on the part of the Israeli authorities towards the civilian population in the occupied areas .  
Building increased public awareness of the social , economic and human costs of anti-personnel mines is essential to develop and sustain the necessary political will for a global anti-personnel mine ban .  
Concerning the use of national human resources , he said that the national staff of UNDP were among its most valuable resources ; in many of the field offices , the only international staff members were the resident representatives and their deputies , while all the others were nationals , who were generally experienced in the work of UNDP programmes and projects , familiar with the culture and language , and frequently had worked for the Government , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the mass media . 
Such practices are also liable to generate a worrying state of affairs , not only for Iraq , but also for Turkey and the region as a whole , which is primarily afflicted by the irregular situation created by the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq , not to mention the human injury to which Iraqi citizens are exposed as a result of the illegitimate activities of the Turkish armed forces and their military operations inside the territory of the Republic of Iraq . 
The Secretary-General believed that priority should be given to such areas as the maintenance of international peace and security ; the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing world ; the promotion of development in Africa ; the protection of human rights ; more effective responses to humanitarian emergencies ; and the promotion of justice and international law .  
The Serbian authorities are continuing their campaign of State terror through , to mention only a few forms , killing and torturing of Albanians , raids of homes throughout Kosova , illegal arrests and systematic persecution and maltreatment of political and human rights activists , imprisonment of people because of their political convictions , systematic and continued campaigns to destroy the Albanian cultural heritage , including by halting education in Albanian and crushing the efforts of the Albanians to preserve their identity in Kosova .  
The programme is thus composed of the three following major activities : promotion and implementation of the principles of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , and rights contained in other relevant international instruments ; cooperation and coordination with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , including with the international human rights community , and the programme of technical assistance and advisory services ; and , dialogue with Governments and all other parties concerned with minority issues .  
With reference to a participatory approach to sustainable human settlements through the development and support of strategies and mechanisms that encouraged open and inclusive dialogue among all interested parties , it was stressed that special attention needed to be paid to minorities .  
In a number of cases , Special Rapporteurs , appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries , and on thematic issues , have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
The present report is a joint interim report submitted to the General Assembly by Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and Mr . Param Cumaraswamy , Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the independence of judges and lawyers , pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1996 / 79 of 23 April 1996 , entitled " Situation of human rights in Nigeria " .  2 .  The report is divided into five chapters .  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Recognize that increased use of solar energy can reduce environmental degradation caused by adverse human activities , such as industrial pollution and deforestation , and that it is the responsibility of Governments and all sectors of civil society to work together to find lasting solutions to problems threatening the sustainable development of humanity ;  
In addition to the constitutional protection of individual and social rights and freedoms , Greece has signed and sanctioned virtually all international conventions on human rights and on the elimination of racial discrimination , in particular :  
Since many questions and misunderstandings surround the definitions and content of the terminologies of sects , new religious movements and even formal religion and since in international practice confusion reigns and States may have diametrically opposed attitudes to the same group , raising it to formal religious status or pejoratively classifying it as a sect , the Special Rapporteur feels that an international high-level governmental conference should be held to study and decide upon a common approach to sects and religions that respects human rights . 
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
As a regional political organization of which Tajikistan is a member and which had established a rapport with the Government before becoming involved with humanitarian work , OSCE is in a position not only to monitor human rights but to support the development of the entire democratic process , combining an active field presence with political influence .  
In resolution 1996 / 54 , the Commission , inter alia , commended the continued operation in Cambodia of the office of the Centre for Human Rights ; welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the role of the Centre ; recognized the seriousness with which the Government of Cambodia has approached the preparation of its initial reports to the relevant treaty bodies , and encouraged the Government to continue its efforts to meet its reporting obligations under international human rights instruments , drawing on the assistance of the office in Cambodia of the Centre for Human Rights ;  
The High Commissioner stressed the importance of human rights education in the school system , welcomed the impressive amount of human rights education , both formal and informal , ongoing in Cambodia , and informed the workshop participants of United Nations efforts to promote human rights education worldwide through the mechanism of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education . 
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
The objectives of the Independent Bureau have remained the same as those pursued by the Independent Commission , i.e . , to study specific humanitarian issues that have been inadequately dealt with to date or that call for solutions in line with new realities ; to identify opportunities for more effective action by the international community and to make practical , action-oriented proposals to that end ; to enhance public awareness of the conditions that create and perpetuate human suffering ; and to strengthen efforts at governmental and non-governmental level to bring about appropriate changes and adjustments . 
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
Distinct from the framework of fundamental human rights and freedoms , such an approach would concentrate on practical humanitarian problems whose continuing growth needs to be vigorously discouraged through solidarity with the victims as much as the human suffering they entail needs to be alleviated .  
In accordance with the recommendations of the General Assembly in paragraph 6 of its resolution 49 / 194 and of the Commission on Human Rights in paragraph 6 of its resolution 1995 / 54 , the High Commissioner , by a letter of 28 August 1995 addressed to all relevant United Nations agencies and financial institutions , has sought to explore possibilities for obtaining from such institutions , acting within their mandates , technical and financial assistance for supporting the Organization 's efforts to promote human rights and the rule of law .  
The rule of law is understood as a human right in itself but also as essential means for the protection of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
Key components of administrative modernization and local government reform programmes are : the reorganization of civil service personnel administration and the delegation of authority for human resources management to the provincial governments ; the revision of civil service pay , career and incentive structures to enable the Government to recruit and retain qualified staff ; the design and implementation of an integrated public administration training system ;  
However , in spite of donor support and encouragement , progress has been slow in most of these areas for two main reasons : lack of human and financial capacity to manage such complex reforms ; and political sensitivity , which call for broad consultations and negotiations involving Parliament and civil society , thereby further contributing to the complexity of the reform process .  
Major initiatives in the economic management , public sector reform and decentralization area included the assistance to the completion of a comprehensive national Economic Management Capacity-Building Programme ( EMP ) , adopted by the Government in mid-1995 , one component of which is targeted at aid policy and coordination ; the associated Programme Support Document ( PSD ) , which also contemplates the formulation of a sustainable human development ( SHD ) strategy ( with UNICEF ) ; and the continued support to reconstruction and development planning at the provincial and district levels .  
Expressing its solidarity with the people and countries that suffer as a result of natural disasters and expressing also the deepest sympathy to all victims of the natural disasters that have struck in various parts of the globe , Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;  
The specialized agencies also played an active role in the countries in transition : by supporting national efforts to improve management systems in public organizations ; by giving advice on the legislative and regulatory framework necessary for establishing a market economy ; by encouraging decentralization through support to local communities ; by consolidating the democratization process ; by supporting human resource programmes , social programmes and the creation of small and medium-size businesses ; by fostering integration between neighbouring countries , and by generating capital flows .  
The report further noted that Africa 's future economic performance might be impeded by long-term structural constraints to development , such as high external indebtedness , unequal distribution of and access to resources , poorly developed institutions and low levels of human resource development .  
At the regional level , the Economic Commission for Africa played a leading role in assisting Member States in their implementation of the Platform , focusing human and financial resources on enhancing women 's political leadership role and economic empowerment and promoting their legal and human rights .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
At the same time , recent scientific findings , as contained in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , confirmed that the global climate was undergoing changes as a result of human activities and that it was increasingly urgent to take consistent precautionary action .  
Professor Bert Bolin , Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , referring to the paragraph in the Summary for Policy Makers in the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC in which it was stated that " the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate " , said that the paragraph in question had been agreed upon after an extensive discussion and very careful consideration by governments , in view of the importance of the key finding for policy makers . 
He confirms that Azerbaijani prisoners of war were tortured and humiliated , forced to eat dirt , brutally beaten , had open wounds poked with lighted cigarettes and were deprived of their human dignity .  
The Conference expressed concern at the escalation of armed hostilities in Afghanistan , which had resulted in immense human losses and irreparable damage to the country in the economic , social and cultural spheres , and endangered regional peace , stability and security .  
It was not easy to conclude from the report of the Secretary-General on human resources management ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 1 ) whether the Office of Human Resources Management ( OHRM ) had developed the specific guidelines required to translate the universal rules established by the General Assembly for use by programme managers and whether any monitoring mechanism had been put in place to ensure proper implementation at the departmental level of the relevant General Assembly decisions and resolutions .  
At its forty-ninth session , the General Assembly decided to appropriate , on an exceptional basis , $ 4,473,000 under section 21 on the understanding that the posts requested by the Secretary-General for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , the Centre for Human Rights and the human rights presence in Cambodia had been approved on a temporary basis and that all posts would be subject to a detailed review by the Advisory Committee and the Assembly at the earliest opportunity at the resumed forty-ninth session .  
It fully supported the work of the United Nations in the promotion and protection of human rights and commended the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , whose work had enhanced the capacity of the United Nations to face the major challenges in that field , particularly in the wake of the World Conference on Human Rights which had declared human rights to be universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
His delegation believed that disarmament should be treated as a separate and distinct programme ; that decolonization continued to be an issue of vital importance for the United Nations ; and that all aspects of human rights should be addressed in a balanced manner . 
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term " discrimination against women " shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .  
It is also important to set the ways and means to achieve this by utilizing not only official development assistance but also private investment , trade , social infrastructure building , human capacity development , and all other elements which are essential to achieving those targets , as well as by devising an ideal policy mix to suit the concrete socio-economic conditions of the countries involved .  
Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations . [ 1 ] / Resolution 50 / 6 .  
In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .  
" Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall respect fully the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States , their constitutions and the fundamental principles of their legal systems , as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms . "  [ 1 ] / E / 1996 / 99 .  
This biased attitude of the republic of Croatia is evident also in the report of Ms . Elizabeth Rehn of 14 March 1996 , which contains ( on pp . 62-86 ) numerous examples of human rights violations , killings , and mistreatment of the civilian population , destruction of private property , prevention of the return of refugees and so on effected by wilful extremists whose behaviour escapes control .  
Being aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
One of the issues raised was the use of modern means of communication like the Internet to spread racist propaganda , and national and international steps had been proposed to deal with that problem , such as the holding of a seminar sponsored by the Office of the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , bringing together various United Nations bodies and the Internet service providers to discuss the use of the Internet in ways consistent with human rights .  
The hiring of mercenaries to guarantee internal security and public order in African States could be regarded as a threat to the inalienable sovereign responsibility of States for their own internal order and security and to their responsibility to prevent the repression of their citizens or the violation of their human rights ; and the international community should examine the extent to which it considered the recruitment of mercenaries to be legal .  
The right of option must be exercised within a reasonable period from the date of succession and must have no adverse consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their residence in the successor State or their movable or immovable property in that State - a new rule which derived from the progressive development of law and accorded with international human rights standards .  
At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that the concept of development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional undertaking with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition .  
Technical support and cooperation are provided in order to yield concrete results , with special attention being devoted to human resource development and institution-building designed to contribute better to the efforts of recipient countries to create an overall enabling environment at a policy and institutional level .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas ;  
In that part of the former Yugoslavia , the ethnic Albanians , who constituted the overwhelming majority continued to be subjected to Serbian police and military repression and to large-scale violations of their human rights despite repeated condemnations of that situation in the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
While for most developing countries this appears to call for increasing and qualitatively upgrading their infrastructural and human resource base , for economies in transition it would seem largely to involve new ways of using existing R &amp; amp ; D and technological potential - created for a different economic system - in a way that is more appropriate to market economies and their changing societies .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
Faced with the related phenomena of a large informal sector and a missing middle in their enterprise structure , LDCs need to take specific measures , in the context of their enterprise development strategies , targeted at helping their micro and small enterprises to grow and drawing them into the formal sector , through the development of an infrastructural and human resource base , the strengthening of their technological capabilities , and the provision of finance , training and other business support services .  
With regard to the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of peoples to self-determination , the report of the Special Rapporteur gave ample proof of the growing involvement of mercenaries in armed conflict , especially internal armed conflict , and raised important questions on the gaps in national and international legislation relating to such activities , and as to whether the existence of companies selling security services to countries in exchange for concessions should be tolerated .  
Her country had endeavoured to solve the social and economic problems of Crimea , adopting measures which could not be considered discriminatory , since they were compatible with international law and with internationally recognized principles of human rights .  
As part of the measures agreed upon between States and the international organizations , Algeria fully supported proposals for the convening of an international conference on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; the creation of a mechanism to monitor the media as purveyors of hatred , racism and xenophobia ; making the administrative regulations for the granting of visas more flexible ; promoting exchanges between individuals and cross-cultural communication ; and the teaching of human rights at all levels of education .  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
The proclamation of the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People reflected the commitment of the international community to promoting and protecting the human rights of indigenous people , especially their economic , social and cultural well-being .  
The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .  
He hoped that the Decade 's programme of activities would be implemented fully and that problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights , the environment , development , education and health would be solved effectively through efforts at the national level and greater international cooperation .  
All norms and principles of human rights enshrined in regional and international human rights instruments and covenants shall be an integral part of the constitution of the Sudan and any law , decree , executive order or policy measure contrary thereto shall be considered null and void and unconstitutional ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
His delegation had repeatedly expressed the view that the legal regime governing reservations should be kept uniform and agreed that there should be no special regime for normative and , in particular , human rights treaties .  
of those Conventions had deviated from customary international law on certain matters , France nevertheless considered that the rules concerning reservations contained in the 1969 Vienna Convention functioned fairly well and that the system established in 1969 must not be abandoned in favour of positions adopted by some international human rights bodies concerning the allegedly special case of human rights treaties . 
With respect to working methods , his delegation supported the Special Rapporteur 's recommendation that the Commission should adopt a flexible approach involving both codification of international law ( inasmuch as fundamental human rights were involved ) and its progressive development ( as far as matters of succession of States were concerned ) .  
It acts with its partners in the international community to assist in meeting the operational challenges of migration ; to advance understanding of migration issues ; to encourage social and economic development through migration ; and to work towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
By investing in both capital and human resources , attaching special importance to raising the quality of basic and specialized education , the development of work skills , professional training and improvement of qualifications ;  
Although significant progress had been made in the field of human rights , particularly in the eradication of apartheid and the adoption of conventions protecting the human rights of women and children , the enjoyment of political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights was far from being universal , and it was regrettable that the end of the cold war had not brought about an improvement in the situation .  
In discharging its human rights obligations and in its approach to human rights in general , Egypt adhered to a number of principles : the politicization of human rights and their use as an instrument to achieve political objectives must be avoided ; double standards must not be applied to human rights situations ; full account must be taken of cultural differences in the context of human rights issues ; and human rights , including social , economic and political rights and the right to development , were indivisible .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect fundamental human rights in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
The Covenant , which was considered by many to be the single most important human rights instrument , codified the essential freedoms which people must enjoy in an effective democratic society , such as the right to vote and to participate in government , to freedom of peaceful assembly , to equal protection of the law , the right to liberty and security and to freedom of opinion and expression .  
The United States had also ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ; the latter should be a very valuable tool as the international community responded to humanitarian and human rights crises born of racial and ethnic animosities .  
While the international community was giving considerable attention to the promotion and protection of human rights , and while the international and regional human rights mechanisms had therefore gained in effectiveness , it nevertheless had to be recognized that much more needed to be done to check the wave of reported and noted violations , especially in view of the geopolitical instability , regional and ethnic conflicts and recent social turmoil .  
It was essential to monitor the efficacy of the international human rights norms that were the basis of the work of the treaty bodies and the efficacy of the special procedures and thematic machinery which played an irreplaceable role in the effective promotion and protection of human rights .  
His Government was deeply concerned at the lack of progress towards democratization and the continuing violation of human rights in Myanmar , particularly the continuing detention of political prisoners under very harsh conditions , the use of forced labour , the forced displacement of ethnic communities and the ongoing harassment of those engaged in legitimate political activity .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Aside from the heavy tribute paid daily in numerous human lives in particular by the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons the refugees who are returning from Zaire by the thousands , fleeing the cataclysm abroad , are faced with tragic conditions in their own country , Burundi , and are being throttled by an embargo which is arbitrary in every way .  
These are the cause of confrontations and armed conflicts that unfortunately create an exodus of thousands of human beings who take to the roads : men , women , children and old people are left abandoned , adrift in despair wandering waves of humanity searching for safe or supposedly safe places , forced to survive crushed together , sometimes like cattle , in camps where the conditions were just described by our colleague from Zaire as subhuman .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
In view of the unacceptable nature of such human rights violations , the General Assembly must express its deep concern over the recalcitrant attitude of the Nigerian Government to world opinion and adopt measures that were commensurate with the magnitude of human rights violations that had been and continued to be committed by the Government of Nigeria .  
Efforts should continue for the establishment of an international criminal court to combat the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of the most serious crimes against humanity , the worst war criminals and the worst violators of human rights , who went unpunished as a result of defunct or seriously flawed judicial systems and pro domo amnesty laws .  
Attempts to separate international and regional systems for protecting human rights were artificial ; both systems should be complementary and mutually supportive .  
BOHAYEVSKY ( Ukraine ) said that the international protection and promotion of human rights could be effective only if it was based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
Adopting a presumptuous , arrogant and biased approach to the question of human rights , pursuing double standards or politicizing the issue in a deliberate attempt to provoke political confrontation would harm the promotion and protection of those rights .  
His Government reiterated its commitment to work with the United Nations in matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security in the hope that some day all the Organization 's human and financial resources could be devoted to encouraging social development and improving the living conditions of people everywhere .  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Regrettably , the world continued to be confronted by civil strife , ethnic cleansing , lawlessness and extreme poverty , all of which posed a considerable challenge to the full enjoyment of human rights .  
Concrete measures which had been identified included improved police training methods , a protection programme for witnesses of human rights violations , assistance to victims of violent crimes , transfer to civilian courts of competence to try military police crimes , and federal investigation of human rights violations .  
" Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity , and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights . "  
REZVANI ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) said that regional institutions and instruments played a key role in the promotion and protection of human rights , and were capable of reflecting regional political , social , cultural and economic factors .  
The civilian component of the mission , acting under the broadened political mandate thus granted to my Special Representative , has assisted in bringing together various segments of the population in an effort to promote mutual understanding between communities , monitor human rights and ease political and inter-ethnic tensions within the country .  
" Being aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
As respect for fundamental rights and freedoms was an essential precondition for peace and security in the world , and for the prevention of international disputes and conflicts , Governments must , in order to strengthen international human rights monitoring machinery , report in a timely fashion on the manner in which they fulfilled their treaty obligations and must be required to cooperate with the United Nations special rapporteurs , working groups and experts .  
He commended the Commissioner 's efforts to restructure the Centre for Human Rights and emphasized the need for extensive consideration of that question by Member States and guidance by the General Assembly before action was taken .  The right to development was a fundamental human right and must be fully respected and implemented on a firm financial basis .  
The use of alleged human rights violations as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of States must cease , and progress in the human rights field must be accompanied by tangible advances in economic and social development .  
It was paradoxical that those States which were the most vocal critics of the developing countries ' record on human rights were silent upon the subject of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Nevertheless , the period of time covered in his report ( A / 51 / 457 ) was very long and many of the matters referred to had already been resolved , as reflected in reports of the Secretary-General on the situation in Central America and on the progress made in the political , economic and social fields , particularly by the efforts to improve the judicial system , public security mechanisms and human rights institutions .  
The representative of Norway , a country with which Burundi had excellent cooperative relations , had , at a previous meeting , said that the coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at that had taken place in Burundi in 1995 had not improved the security or human rights situation but , on the contrary , had exacerbated the suffering of the people .  
Please describe specific measures taken to guarantee the child 's right to life and to create an environment conducive to ensuring to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child , including physical , mental , spiritual , moral , psychological and social development , in a manner compatible with human dignity , and to prepare the child for an individual life in a free society .  
The purpose of the United Nations internship programme is to promote among the participants ( usually students enrolled in a graduate school ) a better understanding of major problems confronting the United Nations ; the programme also provides departments , at Headquarters and elsewhere , with the assistance of outstanding young students specializing in a relevant field , such as economics , social affairs , international law , international relations , human rights , political science , or public administration .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of guarantees of due process of law , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ;  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
The right to development was thus essential to the peoples of developing countries , who needed higher incomes , improved social , health and education services and a chance to escape from extreme poverty and enjoy better living conditions if they were to be able to make a constructive contribution to the development of democratic systems that would guarantee full respect for their human rights .  
It was also essential to ascertain the truth about the thousands of missing persons ; to assist the victims of genocide , rape and abuse ; and to bring to justice all instigators and perpetrators of crimes against humanity and grave violations of international humanitarian law .  NULLIn view of the crucial need for human rights education , a special publication had been produced containing the texts of all the international human rights instruments stipulated in the Dayton Peace Agreement .  
" Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations . "  
Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations . 
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
The experience of his country and others which had introduced basic economic reforms in tandem with systemic reforms confirmed that the successful pursuit of sustainable growth required that individuals be given the opportunity to be the active agents of change , that they must enjoy basic human rights and freedoms and that entrepreneurship should be encouraged .  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations as set forth in the Charter is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons ; enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expression , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
Welcomes the statement by the Government of the Sudan , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , [ 10 ] in which it pledged its logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery , and , accordingly , calls upon the Government to grant international human rights and humanitarian organizations and independent observers free and unimpeded access to all areas where these violations have been reported ;  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
Urges all States to refrain from adopting or implementing any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those of a coercive nature with all their negative extraterritorial effects , which create obstacles to trade relations among States , thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [ 6 ] and other international human rights instruments , in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development ;  
Rejects coercive extraterritorial measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women and the elderly ;  
Noting that , at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in the relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals in their communities , as well as reports of States Parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
At the World Food Summit recently held in Rome , which it would have been more appropriate to call the " World Hunger Summit " , the rich countries had harped shamelessly on human rights , while destroying food surpluses in order to keep prices high , despite the fact that satisfying one 's hunger was a fundamental human right and that the starvation of millions was the most flagrant , massive and systematic violation of the right to life .  
Respect for fundamental human rights was deeply embedded in what was called the " Pacific way " , a sort of unspoken mutual understanding that meant that respect for the basic rights of all came naturally to the peoples of the Pacific islands and that it was natural for them to seek out dialogue , in other words , to practice democracy , a fact of which they were quite proud .  
He wondered why the United States Government used double standards , accusing some countries of human rights violations , while turning a blind eye to those committed by some of its allies and ignoring the thousands of political detainees and shielding the killing of unarmed women and children and the occupation of foreign territory as it made use of its veto .  
It was regrettable that , instead of striving to halt the widespread gross violations of human rights in their own societies and rectifying their racist and discriminatory attitudes towards nationals of other countries residing in their territories , certain States arrogated to themselves the role of universal guardians and preachers of human rights , levelling unsubstantiated accusations against other countries on a purely selective basis .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
the experience gathered by the Division through its long _ standing technical assistance programmes ( such as ACIS , ASYCUDA , Trade Facilitation , Trade Points , as well as its direct and broad range experience in training human resources in island and land-locked countries for example ) has constantly underlined that , whatever the quality of technologies , the human factor is the essential ingredient for success .  
Besides the concluding observations , the main body of the present report is divided into six sections , on public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative questions .  
The transfer of the productive and social infrastructure of rural human settlements , as well as their housing , to their current occupants remains a complicated undertaking that requires continued efforts from all involved parties , including the affected communities . 
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;

Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Convinced that education and public information activities in the field of human rights were prerequisites for the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the three main sponsors , Australia , Costa Rica and Namibia , had decided to draft a single text combining two previous General Assembly resolutions on that issue . 
To give attention to the rights and needs of adolescent girls , which call for special actions for their protection from sexual exploitation and abuse , harmful cultural practices , teenage pregnancy and vulnerability to sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , and for the development of life skills and self-esteem , reaffirming that the advancement and empowerment of women throughout the life cycle must begin with the girl child at all ages ;  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
" Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of internationally recognized safeguards , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice and the absence of due process of law , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ; 
Moreover , it wished to point out that the fifth preambular paragraph seriously misquoted the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights ; that , contrary to the statement in operative paragraph 3 , nothing in the international human rights instruments precluded the adoption of sanctions under domestic law ; that paragraph 4 wrongly implied that the right to self-determination included a right to trade and economic relations ; and that paragraph 5 incorrectly involved the Commission on Human Rights in issues of trade and economics .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
" Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights " ;  
" Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect fundamental human rights in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 38 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;

Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Recommends that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty and to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty and the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
In an earlier report , JIU had expressed the view that it would be premature and even counterproductive to delegate essential functions before human resources management policies were formulated , all personnel procedures were reviewed and improved , proper demarcation of responsibilities in human resources management was established between OHRM and other offices and departments , and appropriate mechanisms for reporting and accountability were put in place .  
Those measures included the introduction of a human resources management planning function which would enable the Secretariat to project staff needs and design training to meet those needs ; the introduction of performance management through the Performance Appraisal System ; the introduction of people management training designed to enable managers and supervisors to have a better understanding of and to take responsibility for the staff entrusted to them ; and the initial development of a management assignment programme for P-2 and P-3 staff recruited through the national competitive examination process .  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
The enormous human and social strains of globalization could be minimized by stimulating sustained economic growth , particularly in the major industrialized countries .  
In his view , the role of Governments was to create a stable macroeconomic and political environment , to put in place a competent and effective administration , and to create a juridical framework that favoured private investment and guaranteed the maximum development of human resources .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .  
As I pointed out in my previous report , it is in these areas that MICIVIH has placed emphasis since its redeployment in October 1994 and it is in these areas that the Mission , because of its extensive field experience and accumulated expertise , would be able to make a significant contribution to the consolidation of key structures charged with protection of human rights and to the deepening of the democratic process . 
At its 3rd plenary meeting , on 20 September 1996 , the General Assembly , on the recommendation of the General Committee , decided to include in the agenda of its fifty-first session the item entitled " Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " and to allocate it to the Third Committee . 
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
" Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
" Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in the relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals in their communities , as well as reports of States Parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
" Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,

Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but that face economic hardship ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,

The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,

Noting that , at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
At its fifty-first session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1995 / 82 of 8 March 1995 , aware of the rapid development of the life sciences and the dangers that certain practices may pose to the integrity and dignity of the individual and seeking to ensure that scientific progress benefits individuals and develops in a manner respectful of fundamental human rights , invited Governments , the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system ,  
The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences ( CIOMS ) stated that bioethics in the health sector should be guided by generally accepted principles , in particular by the principle that an adequate level of health care should be recognized as a universal and fundamental human right .  
According to the Standard Professional Code for German Physicians , which underlies all individual professional codes in this respect , all physicians , prior to conducting any clinical trial on a human person or epidemiological research using personal data , must seek the advice of a medical ethics commission on the medical and legal issues involved .  
Although the sciences of biology and law seem far apart and unrelated , being regarded as two distinct cultures , in actual fact the concerns of law are closely interlinked with those of biology , particularly after the tremendous achievements made by biological science in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes and the positive or negative improvement of offspring .  
To this end , every State must take the requisite legislative measures to ensure that the law intervenes by placing restrictions and controls on the biological sciences so that these restrictions and controls can help to curb scientific progress that has an adverse effect on human values and creates legal and ethical problems .  
Among other things , the committee is endeavouring to lay down the main principles for reconciling technological progress in these fields with ethical and legal standards , human values , human rights and social , economic and cultural realities .  
UNMIBH was established pursuant to annex 11 of the Peace Agreement to assist the parties in their obligations of providing a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions , by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of guarantees of due process of law , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ;  
" Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of internationally recognized safeguards , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice and the absence of due process of law , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Welcomes the statement by the Government of the Sudan , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , [ 68 ] in which it pledged its logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery , and , accordingly , calls upon the Government to grant international human rights and humanitarian organizations and independent observers free and unimpeded access to all areas where these violations have been reported ;  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply deplore the loss of so many human lives , the material damage and the indescribable suffering caused by armed conflicts in the subregion , which are generating millions of refugees and displaced persons , and express our deep gratitude to the countries and peoples of the subregion for their generous and fraternal hospitality and welcome . 
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
" Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas ;  
Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 of 25 July 1996 ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Recommends that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty and to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty and the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Significant human and financial resources are being devoted by the international community to assistance in mine clearance , which is , by its nature , a long-term task ; to efficient and effective demining programmes where the primary emphasis is on the development of national mine-clearance capacities by afflicted countries ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of victims of landmines .  
Such prohibitions , whether they involved the principle of non-use of force ( subpara . ( a ) ) , avoiding extreme political or economic coercion ( subpara . ( b ) ) , respect for the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents , premises , archives and documents ( subpara . ( c ) ) or the requirement not to derogate from basic human rights , had been generally well accepted .  
The Committee 's evaluation should be seen as decisive for the image of the State in question and should supersede national self-judgement where racial and ethnic issues were concerned , since racism and ethnic conflicts constituted an essential component of the overall human rights equation .  
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .  
Botswana has always maintained that the international community must always aim at ensuring that the financial , material and human resources invested in the cause of peace do not go to waste due to premature withdrawal of a peacekeeping mission .  
" Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;

Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
The odious practice of trafficking involves consistent and systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and requires concerted national and international action .  
This data will be utilized by OHRM 's human resources planning specialist to project external recruitment needs sufficiently in advance as to allow National Competitive Examinations to target occupational groupings of staff to meet the current and anticipated2 needs of the Organization , while addressing as well equitable geographical distribution concerns .  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
Acknowledging the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning and preventive diplomacy , including through the activities of the High Commissioner on National Minorities , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , and its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
Recalling further that the International Organization for Migration assists in meeting the operational challenges of migration and that it is committed to the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society , advancing understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development through migration and to working towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants ,  
Having noted that the tentative programme of work for the period 9-17 December 1996 included three sets of informal consultations on the question of human resources management , his delegation wondered whether , if no tangible progress was made during the first round of consultations , the remaining time slots could be devoted to other priority items .  
However , the Special Rapporteur is essentially concerned with violations of international human rights law , that is the victim must not be penalized , physical integrity must not be violated and violence as defined by the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women must be prohibited and punished .  
In the past year , Turkmenistan adopted a constitutional law on permanent neutrality and a declaration on the international obligations of neutral Turkmenistan in the field of human rights , and set up a national institute for democracy and human rights , which received the support and approval of State and public organizations in various countries .  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
Developing countries which have only recently joined such processes , or which are about to join , should , as appropriate , be assisted through action aimed at poverty alleviation ; institutional strengthening ; human resource development , with special consideration to gender issues and to education and training at all levels ; establishment of mechanisms for increased public participation ; research and technology transfer ; research networking ; ensuring access to , and dissemination and exchange of , information ; development of plans and programmes ; and field-level testing of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management ;  
Europe possesses what is essential for achieving this - a space with a single world-view extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok , where the bipolar world no longer exists and a common value system based on the philosophy of democratic liberalism and respect for human rights is being established . 
The World Conference on Human Rights ( Vienna , June 1993 ) in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action stated that human rights education , training and public information were essential for the promotion and achievement of stable and harmonious relations among communities and for fostering mutual understanding , tolerance and peace .  
In the same resolution the General Assembly invited the specialized agencies and United Nations programmes to contribute , within their respective spheres of competence , to the implementation of the Plan of Action ; called upon a wide range of non-governmental organizations and others to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights ; and requested the existing human rights monitoring bodies to place emphasis on the implementation by Member States of their international obligation to promote human rights education .  
The General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights both called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the Centre for Human Rights in carrying out the activities of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education .  
The United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education shall be guided by the definition and normative basis set out in part I of the present Plan of Action and shall further be directed to creating the broadest possible awareness and understanding of all of the norms , concepts and values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and in other relevant international human rights instruments .  
A comprehensive approach to education for human rights , including civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and recognizing the indivisibility and interdependence of all rights , as defined by the United Nations , shall be adopted for all activities under the Decade .  
In order to enhance their effectiveness , human rights education efforts for the Decade shall be shaped in such a way as to be relevant to the daily lives of learners , and shall seek to engage learners in a dialogue about the ways and means of transforming human rights from the expression of abstract norms to the reality of their social , economic , cultural and political conditions .  
In recognition of the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy , development and human rights , human rights education under the Decade shall seek to further effective democratic participation in the political , economic , social and cultural spheres , and shall be utilized as a means of promoting economic and social progress and people-centred sustainable development .  
Governments should play an active role in the implementation of the programme of the Decade through the development of national plans of action for human rights education , the introduction or strengthening of national human rights curricula in their formal educational systems , the conducting of national information campaigns on human rights and the opening of public access to human rights resource , information and training centres , as well as through enhanced donor support for relevant voluntary funds and international and national human rights education programmes .  
Schools , universities , professional and vocational training programmes and institutions should be encouraged and assisted in developing human rights curricula and corresponding teaching and resource materials , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes , for incorporation into formal education at the early childhood , primary , secondary , post-secondary and adult education levels .  
Appropriate institutions of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , workers ' and employers ' organizations , labour unions , the mass media , religious organizations , community organizations , the family , independent information , resource and training centres and others , for the purpose of incorporating human rights education into non-formal programmes , should be encouraged and assisted in developing and delivering such non-formal programmes , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes .  
Each national focal point should be charged with identifying national human rights education needs , developing a national plan of action , raising funds , coordinating with regional and international bodies involved in implementing the objectives of the Decade and reporting to the High Commissioner for Human Rights on needs , proposals and progress made towards the realization of the goals of the Decade ;  
The survey and evaluation and the resulting preliminary report shall seek to identify with particularity , at the international , regional and national levels , inter alia , the number and types of human rights educational materials available , existing human rights educational institutes , centres and permanent focal points , national percentages of teachers trained in human rights education , the percentage of schools having adopted human rights curricula at the primary , secondary and post-secondary levels , and number and types of human rights education components in professional training and non-formal education programmes .  
National focal points will be encouraged , in the interest of building local and community-based capacities for human rights education , to include all local and community-based organizations in the national roster described in component four above , and to direct their efforts and resources , including support received from international sources , to enabling such local and community-based organizations to deliver effective human rights education to their constituencies .  
With the support of national focal points and national resource and training centres , local and community-based organizations should be prepared to deliver popular human rights education , through vocational and adult education , literacy training , local non-governmental organizations , family outreach and religious education .  
Under the coordination of the High Commissioner and the respective national focal points for human rights education , and according to the plan developed following the survey , Governments and national non-governmental organizations , universities and institutes , will be called upon to carry out translation , publication and distribution of appropriate versions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , with technical and financial assistance from international organizations and programmes , where necessary .  
The national , regional and international structures and networks established under the Decade should continue to serve as permanent focal and contact points for international cooperation in the field of human rights education , and the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , in cooperation with UNESCO , should maintain , and make available upon request , a current roster of such organizations and focal points .  
Our common goal is to ensure that , while keeping and promoting this positive trend , we are vigilant and active in order to contribute together to the maintenance of peace , the establishment and consolidation of democratic societies based on the rule of law and respect for human and minority rights , social development and the promotion of international cooperation .  
The developments which took place prior to the Dayton Peace Agreement proved once again that a lack of firm and prompt international response to aggression leads to further aggravation of crises , causes untold human suffering and makes it all the more difficult to find solutions .  
It is appropriate , therefore , that at this meeting of the Council the international community is renewing its support for further efforts to bring about continued progress towards lasting peace , economic reconstruction , the strengthening of national institutions , the promotion of human rights and justice and , more importantly , respect for the independence , sovereignty , legal continuity and territorial integrity of a unified Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders . 
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
M'MELLA ( Kenya ) said that , in view of his Government 's belief that the integration of environmental policies into national development strategies was an essential component for sustainable socio-economic and human development , it had ratified all the three major conventions that had been prepared pursuant to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
The understanding of the relationship between the environment and sustainable development , coupled with the call by the Rio Conference for an authentic , durable and widespread change of habits and attitudes , especially in industrialized countries , would create a pattern for development that was not only environmentally and socially sustainable , but also equitably distributed with the human person as its central focus .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;

Requests the Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the common system including , inter alia , consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session .  Replace the tables in paragraph ( b ) ( i ) by the following :  
Requests the Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the common system , including , inter alia , consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session . 
Also emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
To that end , the court should be based on optional jurisdiction , its jurisdiction should cover only the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole , it should ensure respect for and primacy of national criminal justice systems , it should be an independent international juridical institution , and accused persons should be accorded all relevant individual human rights and commonly recognized procedural guarantees .  
It had been agreed , in the preliminary exchanges of views , that the Working Group 's visit could with advantage be preceded by a preparatory visit so that , firstly , the Group could more easily take cognizance of certain constraints , political or technical ( for example the problem of distances ) , facing such a visit and to have a better understanding of Chinese law , in particular with regard to the difficulties entailed in bringing it into conformity with the international instruments on human rights .  
" Decides that the priorities for the biennium 1998-1999 are the following : maintenance of international peace and security ; promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and recent United Nations conferences ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts ; promotion of justice and international law ; disarmament ; drug control , crime prevention , as well as combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations ; "  
In its resolution 1996 / 27 of 29 August 1996 , the Sub-Commission requested the Secretary-General , in accordance with Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 290 , to convene an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions and its relationship to internationally recognized human rights , with a view to developing a set of comprehensive human rights guidelines on forced evictions , and to submit the report on the seminar , together with the guidelines , to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
While differences in the economic , social , cultural and historical circumstances of the world 's societies mean that differences will continue between democracy as viewed by one society and democracy as viewed by another , democracy is increasingly being recognized as a response to a wide range of human concerns and as essential to the protection of human rights .  
The material means of progress can be acquired , but human resources - skilled , spirited and inventive workers - are indispensable , as is the enrichment found through mutual dialogue and the free interchange of ideas .  
Within the original framework of the Charter , democracy was understood as essential to efforts to prevent future aggression , and to support the sovereign State as the basic guarantor of human rights , the basic mechanism for solving national problems and the basic element of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
NULLNonetheless , during that time the United Nations was active in keeping international organization alive , in promoting and facilitating decolonization , in easing the transition of newly independent peoples into the international State system , in promoting economic and social development , in building human rights machinery and in defending international law . 
8 December 1988 , reaffirming that the will of the people , expressed in periodic and genuine elections , shall be the basis of authority of government , the General Assembly stressed that , " as a matter of practical experience , the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country is a crucial factor in the effective enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights and fundamental freedoms , embracing political , economic , social , and cultural rights " . 
The global mandate of the United Nations spans economic , social , security , political , humanitarian and human rights issues , which is why the United Nations is active across virtually the full range of issues relevant to democratization and can help integrate these issues into a wider effort linking peacekeeping , refugee assistance , relief efforts , reconstruction and development .  
With the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , held at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 , the United Nations began a series of international conferences that have brought together not only all States , but also relevant non-governmental organizations and other representatives of civil society to focus on interlocking economic and social issues by considering their impact on the human person and human communities .  
The logic of the Charter is today made manifest as United Nations support for democratization helps to prevent aggression and to foster the construction and maintenance of viable and independent States as the basic guarantors of human rights , the basic mechanisms for solving national problems and the basic elements of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
While democratization must take place at all levels of human society - local , national , regional and global - the special power of democratization lies in its logic , which flows from the individual human person , the one irreducible entity in world affairs and the logical source of all human rights .  
In these resolutions , the Commission continued to express its concern at the continuing and endemic violence against women and recognized that violence against women both violated and impaired or nullified the enjoyment by women of their human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In resolution 1996 / 75 , the Commission , concerned at the situation of women and children , especially regarding access to basic education for girl children and access by women to employment , called upon all parties in Afghanistan to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and also called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , economic , political and cultural life throughout the country and to ensure equal treatment to women and girls .  
In the same way , the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Rwanda stated ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 7 ) that the genocide of the Tutsis , the massacres of moderate Hutus and the renewed fighting in the civil war which followed were marked by many grave violations of international humanitarian law .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the Urban and Housing Indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in the civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , i.e . , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
Sweden has identified eight policy areas which represent the most fundamental and important challenges that have to be addressed effectively in the short and medium term in the country to ensure adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of Swedish human settlements .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
" At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that development has evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional process , with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition . "  
The delegation of Colombia considered that the reference in article 6 , paragraph 4 the representation of different forms of civilization was not only unnecessary but also constituted a dangerous precedent in the universal conception of the human rights , considering that gross human rights violations often took place using as a pretext the necessity of defending particular forms of civilization .  
The members of the Sub-Committee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia pays special attention to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms by devoting its whole chapter 3 entitled Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms to the elaboration of different human rights standards including both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , mainly following the standards elaborated in major international human rights instruments .  
enslaved national minorities such as the African _ Americans , Afro _ Brazilians , Dalits , etc . who suffer acute and persistent inequalities due to centuries of gross violation of their human rights through official State policies of enslavement , segregation , and attempted forced assimilation into the bottom levels or underclass of the dominant majority . 
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on the respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
Particular emphasis should be given to the cooperative and collaborative efforts of the landlocked and transit developing countries in dealing with the transit problems , inter alia , through improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral agreements to govern transit transport operations ; development of joint ventures in the area of transit transport ; and strengthening of institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management to effectively utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
Of the listed persistent organic pollutant ( POP ) pesticides and industrial chemicals that are or have been intentionally produced , other than for the small number of remaining recognized uses , these POPs pose unreasonable and otherwise unmanageable risks to human health and the environment such that :  
This partnership will be built on an integrated and holistic approach to human rights , in the framework of which all rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development , are perceived as of equal importance , interrelated and mutually supportive .  
The Commission also considered the report of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 17 ) , submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 1996 / 12 , concerning the problems related to the right to enjoy an adequate standard of living ; foreign debt , economic adjustment policies and their effects on the full enjoyment of human rights and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
Subsequently , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 10 , entitled " Effects on the full enjoyment of human rights of the economic adjustment policies arising from foreign debt and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development " , in which it requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session , after high-level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies and intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 17 , entitled " Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights " .  
The technical cooperation programme has focused on incorporating international human rights standards in national legal systems , developing policies and practices and building national capacities and regional structures for the promotion and protection of all human rights , democracy and the rule of law .  
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 58 on this situation decided to request " the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Zaire and on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and a member of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to carry out a joint mission to investigate allegations of massacres and other issues affecting human rights which arise from the situation prevailing in eastern Zaire since September 1996 " .  
Some people have thought that the end of the so-called cold war would be conducive to the creation of favourable conditions for equitable and healthy international relations based on mutual respect and fruitful and constructive cooperation among human communities .  
With that perception , we believe that it is high time to completely do away with the obsolete ways of thinking and acting of the past , namely , the imposition of inequitable terms of economic and trade relations , sanctions and embargoes , and so forth , which distort international relations , cause suffering to the people and seriously violate the minimum right of human beings the right to a peaceful life .  
As Mali sees it , any work towards sustainable development is above all a national responsibility , through the effective definition and application of sound macroeconomic policies , based on transparency , the pre-eminent rule of law , the practice of democracy , respect for human rights , social justice , and the participation of all in the effort of national development .  
On the basis of the cooperation agreement signed in 1976 between the two intergovernmental institutions , and strengthened in 1990 by an additional protocol creating a joint consultative commission , joint operational activities are regularly carried out by UNESCO and the Agency in the areas of basic education , education for adults , and after-school education the very foundations of an economic and social development that truly takes into account the human dimension of progress .  
Indeed , increased cooperation between the two organizations will , we hope , make it possible to establish the foundations for international cooperation that is free from ideological confrontation and resolutely determined to meet its global challenges : economic and social development ; strengthening democracy and respect for human rights ; the promotion of sustainable development while taking account of the need for environmental conservation ; the struggle against the scourge of drugs ; and the promotion of gender equality .  
At the same time , my country reaffirms the pressing importance of the promotion of wide-ranging global and regional cooperation , based on shared perceptions within a broad framework , in order to address social , economic and developmental problems and to ensure the protection of human rights and other basic freedoms .  
It describes the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 51 / 18 of 14 November 1996 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States .  
Mr . Yakovlev ( Russian Federation ) ( interpretation from Russian ) : The purposes set out in the statutes of the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) to unite parliamentarians to secure the broad participation of States in the strengthening of international peace and security , in the firm establishment of representative institutions and in the defence of human rights are largely consonant with the aspirations of the United Nations .  
Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy representative of its Group in that most important organ and to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy : the promotion of human rights , respect for international humanitarian law , respect for the principle of non-intervention , total compliance with the prohibition of the use of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal means of implementing the right of peoples to self-determination .  
A culture of peace will contribute to international cooperation for economic and social development and sustained economic growth in the developing countries of our world and permit the billions of dollars spent each year on armaments of death and mass destruction to be directed towards eradicating poverty , facilitating human development and making our world a better place to live in for all , developed and developing countries alike .  
The shared effort to build a culture of peace in the region has changed from an academic discussion to a fact of everyday life , in which we are promoting and fostering the concrete values of peace : tolerance , respect for human rights , solidarity , social justice and the rejection of violence as a method of resolving social or any other type of conflicts , all elements that are contributing to the integral development of our peoples .  
For the United Nations to make a difference and provide leadership in today 's complex world , it must recover the original meaning of the Charter by concentrating on its essential mission : maintaining international peace and security , promoting justice and international law , strengthening cooperation for development , protecting human rights and providing humanitarian assistance .  
The region \ x { e5b8 } constant focus on democracy , good governance , peace , security and nuclear disarmament ; its undertaking to take responsibility for the proper and responsible management of the environment ; the protection of fish and other marine resources ; cultural and technology exchanges ; and economic cooperation and respect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone is successfully dealing with a changing global environment .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
I believe it is time that we members of the Conference began to assert the strength of our numbers and potential influence and aired our collective opinions on the vital issues of the day , such as in the realm of global peace and security , environmental protection and conservation , sustainable development , human rights and overall economic and social development . 
When the United Nations was founded , it inscribed among the purposes set forth in its Charter the maintenance of international peace and security , the development of friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and the promotion and encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Following the peaceful changes that took place in Benin after the National Conference of Active Forces of the Nation in February 1990 , the people of Benin have been experiencing an era of democratic renewal based , inter alia , on the building of the rule of law , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development through its three component factors economic , social and environmental .  
I am among those who believe that democracy and the establishment of a human rights regime at the planetary level are both irresistible and irrepressible , and that the limits are constituted only by the limits of personal liberty itself that is , when our liberty infringes upon the liberty of our fellow human beings for , after all , we are all social beings .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
This is not to mention bolstering the role of institutions and charitable organizations , notably the Zayed charitable organization and the Red Crescent , as well as other organizations , aimed at helping them achieve their humanitarian objectives for the purpose of mobilizing local efforts in the public and private sectors , and meeting appeals to meet human needs and emergency demands in parts of the world that have been affected or are impoverished .  
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
A quick review of its recent report transmitted to the General Assembly indicates that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories expressed its grave concern at the existing human rights situation in the occupied territories as a result of the settlerist policy pursued by the current Israeli Government . 
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .  
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
At the threshold of the third millennium , it is unacceptable that poverty and pollution still dominate the daily lives of billions of people all over the world ; it is unacceptable that hostilities and hatred still create deadly new conflicts and humanitarian disasters , between and within States on all continents ; and it is unacceptable that basic human and individual rights are still widely violated through injustice by Governments and the negligence of the international community .  
The objective of sustainable development should be the integration of environmental , economic and social policies in order to meet basic human needs and to manage the environment on a sustainable basis .  
In our view , we can move towards the gradual realization of a global civil society through institutionalization of these two fundamental principles and by committing ourselves to pluralism , tolerance , dialogue among civilizations , promotion of human rights , comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development , justice and equality of opportunities as the governing norms in our interactions .  
Taking full advantage of historical affinities , cultural ties and religious bonds and sparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated manner the human and natural potential and resources of the region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of security and tranquillity .  
Terrorism is the wicked result of widespread lawlessness and the violent obstruction of public participation , which in its various forms and manifestations threatens human societies at the national , regional and international levels . 
The prolonged cycle of violence and hostilities , as a direct consequence of Israel 's continued illegal occupation of Arab territories , has brought tremendous political , economic and social sufferings and hardships to the people of the region , including the loss of human lives .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America is an integral development programme that focuses on the human being as the central and primary subject of development and gives priority to economic and social growth in our countries and to the protection and conservation of the ecosystem , as is evidenced by regional efforts in the areas of biodiversity , climate change and forests .  
We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .  
We are concerned at the constant threat to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States coming from Afghanistan ; the flow of narcotics and contraband weapons ; reports that reach us about gross violations of humanitarian law by the warring factions , including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war ; the blockade by the Taliban of the central regions of Afghanistan populated by the Hazara people , and the continuing large-scale violations of human rights , particularly the rights of women and children .  
Against the background of the continued occurrence of crimes of aggression and grave violations of human rights and humanitarian laws , all subject to punishment , the United Nations has remained either silent or incapable of taking necessary and practical measures .  
Landmines exact a high human , social , economic and environmental cost and make it difficult to create the conditions needed for sustainable development in afflicted regions .  
The international community is devoting considerable human and financial resources to assistance in mine clearing , which by its very nature is a long-term job ; to efficient mine clearance programmes in which the primary emphasis needs to be on helping the afflicted countries to develop national mine clearance capability ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of landmine victims .  
Japan , which experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently desires that the use of nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , should never be repeated and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards creating a world free of nuclear weapons .  
In themselves such weapons threaten an imbalance in nature , and many of the biological agents that can be used as weapons are capable of frustrating all the efforts made in previous decades to eradicate diseases that are highly contagious and extremely dangerous to human health worldwide .  
My predecessor , the late President Cheddi Jagan , challenged the international community on many occasions to strive for a new global human order , a development paradigm which would seek simultaneously to achieve optimal economic growth , social equity , poverty reduction and protection of the environment : a development model rooted in a partnership that seeks a better balance within and among States .  
Mr . Afful ( Ghana ) : Five years ago we met in Rio de Janeiro to elaborate integrated strategies aimed at achieving two major goals : first , to halt and reverse the negative impact of human behaviour on the physical environment , and secondly , to promote sustainable economic development in all countries .  
With this positive landscape in international relations and expectations , the United Nations embarked upon a series of unprecedented global conferences addressing key issues facing mankind , ranging from environment , human rights , population , social development , women and human settlements to food security . 
The United Nations system has a key role to play in dealing with the development migration nexus by addressing the root causes of migration ; strengthening national , regional and global efforts to achieve sustainable development ; and supporting efforts to ensure orderly migration while promoting and protecting the human rights of migrants .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
In her special report on minorities ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 8 ) the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia expressed concern at the failure of the former Yugoslavia 's political leadership to meet the challenge of governing populations which do not share the nationality , ethnicity , religion or language of the different regions ' dominant national groups .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
The decision also served as a basis for an appeal from the Federation Council to legislative ( representative ) and executive organs of State power of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation that the situation regarding the provision of supplies and equipment to the Russian penal system which had deteriorated markedly in recent years ; the conditions of detention in remand centres ( sizos ) under the control of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MVD ) constituted flagrant violations of human rights and of the law and the international obligations of the Russian Federation .  
The urgent appeal procedure is not per se accusatory , but essentially preventive in nature and purpose .  The Government concerned is merely requested to look into the matter and to take steps aimed at protecting the right to physical and mental integrity of the person concerned , in accordance with the international human rights standards .  
The four specific action areas laid out in the mission statement - operational assistance , advancement of understanding of the issues , encouragement of social and economic development through migration , and upholding the human dignity and well-being of migrants - permeate the Programme of Action , too , and provide a solid basis for IOM 's institutional commitment to moving the international consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development towards concrete action .  
While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
PHR is a Boston-based non _ governmental organization of forensic anthropologists , archaeologists , pathologists and other health professionals that seeks to use medical and scientific knowledge to protect human rights and promote accountability for violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular by investigating mass graves to identify victims of extrajudicial executions .  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
Weak technological infrastructures , a severe shortage of qualified human resources and limited financial means explain in part the persistent nature of the problem confronting many developing countries .  
Where Stockholm adopted an issue-oriented approach to pollution and non-renewable resource depletion , Rio emphasized integrated strategies to promote human development through economic growth based on sustainable management of the natural resource base .  
In implementing the Guidelines , it should be borne in mind that achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , is one of the principal objectives of the United Nations .  
One essential lesson learned in the HIV / AIDS epidemic is that universally recognized human rights standards should guide policy-makers in formulating the direction and content of HIV-related policy and form an integral part of all aspects of national and local responses to HIV / AIDS .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , States have the duty , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , in accordance with international human rights standards .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
These human rights are reinforced by the principles of participatory democracy , which assumes the involvement of PLHAs and their families , women , children and groups vulnerable to HIV / AIDS in designing and implementing programmes that will be most effective by being tailored to the specific needs of these groups .  
States should review and reform public health legislation to ensure that they adequately address the public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Whereas the Constitution in force since 1986 sets forth the responsibility of the State , as the expression of the legal and political organization of society , for promoting the common good and the consolidation of the rule of legality , security , justice , equality , freedom and peace , and defines as a central concern the promotion of the full enjoyment of human rights within a stable , permanent and popular institutional order in which governed and government act with absolute adherence to the law ,  
Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional , political , economic , social and ethnic issues , on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity ,  
Each of the High Contracting Parties guarantees to nationals of the other Parties resident in its territory , regardless of their ethnic affiliation , religion or other differences , social , economic and cultural rights and freedoms in accordance with universally accepted international human rights standards .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and inadequate access to technologies may hinder implementation and compliance with international legal instruments .  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1993 / 14 , requested the Secretary _ General to prepare basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment and economic , social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and the international financial institutions .  
The reports of Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially the final report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1992 / 16 ) , contain a wide _ ranging analysis of how structural adjustment programmes have had negative effects on a range of human rights .  
Communications under the 1503 procedure are admissible only if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they may reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; any replies received from the Governments concerned must be taken into account . 
However , recent outbreaks of cholera in Peru and a " plague scare " in India ( see box 4 ) have clearly demonstrated the human suffering and loss of life that may result from poor waste management and the disastrous effect that waste-related diseases may have on the trade and tourism vital for national economy .  
The peri-urban poor live in the most hazardous environment where their health is at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals and pathogens from domestic solid wastes and human faecal wastes .  
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , from which the relevant provisions of resolution 1995 / 34 derived , identified grave violations of human rights as involving the following : genocide , slavery , summary executions , torture , enforced disappearances , arbitrary and prolonged detention , deportation or forcible transfer of population or systematic discrimination .  
RECOGNIZING the importance of observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights instruments , as well as respect for international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts , and bearing in mind the complementarity between human rights and international humanitarian law in improving protection of the individual and respect for his dignity in situations of armed conflict ,  
Acknowledging the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning and preventive diplomacy , including through the activities of the High Commissioner for National Minorities , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , and its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
The global and regional exchange of new knowledge and expertise derived from local best practices , as well as new networks among major groups active in human settlements development will need to be supported .  
As a direct consequence of recommendations of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) in 1994 , more than a dozen multilateral and bilateral assistance agencies began discussions leading to the formation of the " Urban Forum " , to serve as a vehicle for information exchange , and joint programming in the field of sustainable human settlements development .  
Given the rates of urbanization in developing countries and subsequent new needs for services and infrastructure in human settlements , it is somewhat alarming to note that not much progress has been made on developing new mechanisms for sustained financing , on the scale required for the building , operating and maintaining of basic services and infrastructure ( see table ) . 
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
The purpose of the workshop was once again to make the international community more aware of the very serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law which are committed by Government authorities , armed groups or individuals in situations of internal disturbances , crises and tensions , including latent or low _ intensity conflicts .  
Dr Yves Sandoz , Director of International Law and Policy , International Committee of the Red Cross , noted that the starting point of the Workshop was the recognition that protection afforded to the victims of internal violence covered by international humanitarian law was inadequate ; the Workshop was an attempt to escape from the endless debate on the applicability of international law and of human rights instruments in clarifying rules applicable in all situations .  
The idea of minimum humanitarian standards , formally born in Turku , Finland , presented , in his opinion , an attempt to integrate existing human rights and humanitarian norms into one set of principles relevant to situations of internal violence .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 1 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably " with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out " .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacity in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
Moreover , mention should be made of two key issues which have a decisive influence on the human rights situation in Guatemala : the values , attitudes and social behaviours that go to create the overall context in human rights violations take place and are encouraged and tolerant ; and the main characteristics of the functioning of the State institutions responsible for protecting human rights . 
In order for the disbanding and disarming of military commissioners and CVDCs to lead to a fundamental change in the human rights situation , it is necessary to eradicate the counter-insurgency mentality , which is a source of potential human rights violations , and to promote in its place tolerance , unrestricted public participation and the effective presence of institutions for the protection of human rights .  
The Mission hopes that the Guatemalan armed forces , in the context of their considerable efforts to put an end to the internal armed conflict and to accept the institutional changes set forth in the Peace Agreements , will noticeably increase their cooperation in clarifying and punishing crimes and human rights violations in which some of their members may be implicated .  
As mentioned in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports and information on grave and widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by government agents , and abuses and atrocities committed against the life , liberty and security of individuals by members of different parties to the armed conflict in the country other than the Government of the Sudan in the areas under their control .  
In this respect , the Special Rapporteur recalls Commission resolutions 1994 / 79 , 1995 / 77 and 1996 / 73 , in which , inter alia , it called upon the Government to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with the instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoyed fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
Likewise , all political , military or police authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina violating the Dayton / Paris Accords , international law and basic human rights must be held accountable and confronted by those responsible for implementation .  
Recalling further that the International Organization for Migration assists in meeting the operational challenges of migration and that it is committed to the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society , advancing understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development through migration and to working towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants ,  
The Assembly also appealed to Governments to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other international instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
Four working groups have been constituted within the Committee to assess the state of human rights education in the following areas : primary and secondary schools ; universities and higher education ; adult education , including several professional groups ( police , armed forces , judges , teachers , social workers , etc . ) ; and activities undertaken by NGOs , associations and trade unions .  
The Plan includes clear objectives , target audience ( organized and unorganized elements of society ) , strategies ( trainers training , organization of networks , integration of human rights in all educational curricula , utilization of village-level officials to reach out to the community level , promotional campaigns including artistic and cultural activities , development of monitoring and evaluation systems , etc . ) and programmes , including the creation of a human rights training , documentation and research centre ( the Human Rights Academy ) .  
As reported in document A / 51 / 506 , draft guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national Plans of Action for human rights education .  
The High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities to strengthen national capacities in the field of human rights education ; details of these activities at the national , regional and global levels are outlined in the relevant report of the Secretary-General to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 86 ) .  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups ( prison officers ; primary and secondary school teachers ; judges and lawyers ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; journalists ; human rights monitors ) undertaken by the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
In possession of considerable information relating to alleged serious violations of human rights in Nigeria , and in the absence either of a substantive response from the Government concerning specific allegations transmitted during the year or of the opportunity to visit the country , the Special Rapporteurs were thus required at least to inform the General Assembly about the substance of allegations received and to draw such preliminary conclusions as may be possible by reference to , e.g . , declared laws and acknowledged practices .  
The proclamation of a unilateral declaration of independence and the creation of the Bougainville Interim Government followed ; the situation has not yet returned to normal and , even though the naval blockade has been lifted , the population in some areas continues to be deprived of basic requirements and many allegations of serious violations of human rights continue to be reported . 
The representative of the National Commission on Human Rights of Cameroon stated that at the regional level , other African national human rights institutions had entrusted Cameroon 's National Commission with the task of planning , preparing and hosting the first African Regional Conference of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights with the objective , among others , of encouraging States in the region to create their own national institutions ( see also paras .  25 _ 27 ) .  
In its continuous search for new channels for promoting and protecting human rights , the National Commission had initiated contacts with religious bodies , and had become deeply involved in investigating inter _ ethnic land conflicts which had assumed alarming dimensions .  
The Conference sowed the seeds of a new form of cooperation between national institutions in Africa ; it met in the context of the tenth anniversary of the African Charter of Human and Peoples ' Rights and addressed a subject of vital importance for Africa , that of strengthening human rights mechanisms which can act as a buffer between the public authorities and civil society , which promote the process of democratization and guarantee the rule of law .  
It is for this reason that the expert has urged the political authorities and representatives of civil society , especially the Plate-forme des organisations ha \ x { 9ba0 } iennes des droits de lhomme , to develop a sweeping programme of civic education and human rights training and to introduce legal services into rural areas .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that rebels , Tutsi militias or Tutsi groups from the displaced persons ' camps accompanying the military , are all equally guilty of murderous acts that result in grave violations of international humanitarian law and human rights .  
In view of the accelerated deterioration of the situation in Burundi and the current crisis afflicting the Great Lakes region , the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that , during the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , a special day should be devoted to considering all the problems confronting the subregion , culminating in the adoption of a joint resolution , in accordance with the wish expressed by the three Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Burundi , Rwanda and Zaire .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Recommends that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty and to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty and the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
The basic mandate established by the Commission for the Sub _ Commission is ( a ) to undertake studies , particularly in the light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights concerning the prevention of discrimination of any kind relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and the protection of racial , national , religious and linguistic minorities , ( b ) to perform any other functions which may be entrusted to it by the Economic and Social Council or the Commission on Human Rights .  
The input of the United Nations University ( UNU ) to the preparatory process included international conferences on world cities and urban future , and human settlements in the changing global political and economic processes .  
The participants stressed their role in the development and future of human settlements and announced the establishment of a permanent coordinating structure , to be known as the World Association of Cities and Local Authorities Coordination , to coordinate their partnership with the United Nations system and with other international agencies .  
The growing international concern at such problems as freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention , protection against all forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , circumstances and conditions of detention and imprisonment , and humanization of criminal justice were cornerstones of the protection of human rights .  
Those topics should be related to the most urgent problems , demanding concerted action of particular importance , such as the struggle against transnational organized crime and terrorism , which had a detrimental impact on the full enjoyment of human rights and constituted a serious danger to peace and security , at both the national and international levels .  
However , the ever-growing demand on the United Nations human rights programme to engage in such areas as confidence _ building measures , technical cooperation , education , monitoring , etc . makes it indispensable to establish an adequate and reliable mix of regular budget resources and voluntary contributions from Governments and private entities .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Gender mainstreaming in such substantive areas as economic and social matters , peace and security , human rights , sustainable development and humanitarian affairs requires an institutional culture that is conducive to such mainstreaming .  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , 1 the International Covenants on Human Rights2 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of internationally recognized safeguards , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice and the absence of due process of law , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but that face economic hardship ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
The key elements are : ( a ) the creation of an effective and professional human resource management organization ; ( b ) implementation of human resource measures sensitive to a more equitable gender-balance in decision-making ; ( c ) increased efficiency of transaction-based services ; ( d ) maintenance of competitive benefits and conditions of service ; ( e ) foundations for continuous learning and learning opportunities for key staff .  
To make sustainable human development ( SHD ) a reality in this new context , a more integrated approach is required , one that allows economic growth , social equity and environmental sustainability to move forward together .  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Also strongly urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression and assembly , the right to fair trial and the protection of the rights of persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities , and to put an end to violations of the right to life and integrity of the human being , to the practices of torture , abuse of women , forced labour and forced relocations and to enforced disappearances and summary executions ;  
Noting that , at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , held in April , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to support the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
In addition , it exceeded the mandate of a human rights working group by recommending detailed social , political and economic programmes at the national and international levels , and guidelines for international cooperation , some of which were not directly linked to the impact of structural adjustment programmes .  
In the context of the discussion of paragraph ( 3 ) , a question was raised as to whether the reference to keys of natural and legal persons provided sufficient guidance in situations where cryptographic keys were issued directly to electronic devices , or used by such devices , in the absence of direct human intervention .  
It is a dynamic long-term process , including economic and social development as essential elements , seen in perspectives that may change over time , and leading to improved quality of life for all human beings , the eradication of poverty and the reduction of inequality .  
Road transport and other forms of transportation to a lesser extent , impose social costs in the form of accidents ; damage to human health from particulate matter , carbon monoxide , lead , volatile organic compounds and other pollutants ; congestion ; noise nuisance ; community severance , the " barrier effect " ; local air pollution ; transboundary air pollution from nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides ; and global warming from carbon dioxide emissions .  
Recalling also and concurring with the conclusions of and recommendations made by recent international conferences on the human rights of women and girl children , in particular with respect to the violation of those rights through sexual and economic exploitation for the profit of recruiters , traffickers and crime syndicates , as well as other illegal activities related to trafficking , such as forced domestic labour , false marriages , child marriages , clandestine employment and false adoption ,  
In the statement at its fifty _ second session , the Commission expressed its deep concern that the disproportionate use of force by the Russian Federation armed forces was continuing to lead to grave violations of human rights , as well as of international humanitarian law .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
Recalling the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annexed to General Assembly resolution 49 / 60 of 9 December 1994 , in which the Assembly declared that acts , methods and practices of terrorism constituted a grave violation of the purpose and principles of the United Nations , and might pose a threat to international peace and security , jeopardize friendly relations among States , hinder international cooperation and aim at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic bodies of society ,  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
This has arisen from our understanding of the mandate of the Rapporteurs as derived from the enabling resolutions , the standard terms of reference for fact-finding missions of special rapporteurs / representatives of the Commission on Human Rights , existing practice and the emerging human rights jurisprudence governing similar missions .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
ESCWA reports an increase in the number of projects implemented on the basis of the TCDC modality , and has cited two examples , namely , on local community development in rural areas , and on preparatory assistance for regional support to the national pursuit of sustainable human development .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights ,  
Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Expressing its grave concern at the enormous human suffering and material damage sustained by the Libyan Arab people and neighbouring peoples as a result of the maintenance of the coercive measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriya under Security Council resolutions 748 ( 1992 ) and 883 ( 1993 ) ,  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining its multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at the universal and effective respect of all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Stressing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis , as reaffirmed in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
The active involvement of women at the national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health ; in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
Reiterating the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action which states that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,  
Calls upon relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to make , within their respective mandates and fields of action , an assessment of , and to put forward pertinent conclusions on , the state of implementation and the impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Mindful that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights ,  
Reaffirming that activities to improve public knowledge in the field of human rights are essential to the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the United Nations set out in Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , education and information are essential to the achievement of lasting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , Recalling previous General Assembly and its own resolutions on this subject ,  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Concerned that implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the Beijing Platform for Action remains far from the objectives set forth in the two documents and , therefore , calls once again for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status and human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms ;  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Welcomes the efforts of the High Commissioner to create an environment viable for return in post _ conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , broad _ based programmes of human rights education as well as the strengthening of local non _ governmental organizations through programmes of advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Calls upon the Government of the Sudan to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with those instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoy fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
To condemn the persistent Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied regions of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa , as exemplified by the kidnapping and arbitrary arrest of civilians and the destruction of their homes , the confiscation of their property and their expulsion from their land , as well as by the shelling of peaceful villages and urban areas ;  
If a serious political dialogue is re-established among the main Somali factions , we sincerely hope that a national reconciliation package will include the following measures : respect for human rights , and an end to the appalling situation still prevailing in the country ; the establishment of , and strict adherence to , the rule of law ; the creation of a national army and a national police force ; and the promise of elections , whenever feasible , to ensure the primacy of democracy .  
The difficulties experienced in the search for mines and remnants of war on Libyan territory due to the lack of maps and precise data on location , number and type , in addition to the fact that they are scattered at random over an extensive area , make it hard to give a comprehensive and precise report on the human and material losses caused by landmines and remnants of war in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya . 
Although the aim of producing the above-mentioned report ( which was prepared by a United Nations expert ) was not to study the problem of landmines and remnants of war and their effect on the future of the country and its development , the references to and preliminary estimates of war damages make it clear beyond any doubt that what was suffered by Libya during the military operations , and the landmines and explosives left by those operations , represented a human and material disaster of incalculable proportions . 
The limited human , technical and material national resources have been concentrated on sweeping areas where mines and remnants of war are known to be present , and where their location has been established by citizens ' reports on the accidents they have caused or by companies carrying out development projects .  
Indicators and best practices ( global urban observatory ) ; policy framework for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; global analysis of national enabling legislation and public policy formulation required for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; and human settlement conditions and trends : country profiles and statistical analysis ;  
The Convention envisages that , to be effective , this equality must be achieved within the framework of a political system in which each citizen enjoys the right to vote and be elected at genuine periodic elections held on the basis of universal suffrage and by secret ballot , in such a way as to guarantee the free expression of the will of the electorate , as provided for under international human rights instruments , such as article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
By resolution 8 ( XXIII ) of 16 March 1967 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to give annual consideration to the item entitled Question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including policies of racial discrimination and segregation and of apartheid , in all countries , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 36 _ 44 above ) . 
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 24 , welcomed with satisfaction the second interim report on the question of the impunity of perpetrators of violations of human rights ( economic , social and cultural rights ) prepared by Mr . El Hadji Guiss ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 15 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
At its forty-fifth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1993 / 40 , decided to entrust Mr . Asbj \ x { 9de8 } n Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels , taking also into account matters related to the realization of the right to development , with a view to determining how most effectively to strengthen activities in this field .  
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa , ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
The Commission on Human Rights , at its fifty-second session , in its decision 1996 / 104 , decided to recommend to the Economic and Social Council , in the light of the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , to be held in Istanbul in June 1996 , to authorize the holding of an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions with a view to developing comprehensive human rights guidelines on development-based displacement .  
At its forty _ eighth session the Sub _ Commission had before it the revised set of basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law prepared by Mr . van Boven ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 17 ) .  
In its decision 1996 / 119 , the Sub _ Commission , having considered that report decided to request the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its forty _ ninth session a revised version of the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity contained in annex II of the final report , taking into account the comments and observations received .  
The Sub-Commission , at its forty-eighth session , in its resolution 1996 / 30 , requested the Special Rapporteur to update the list of States which have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency with a view to its consideration by the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session , and requested him to submit final conclusions on the protection of human rights during states of emergency , together with specific recommendations as to how this question should be dealt with in the future .  
At its fifty _ third session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1997 / 71 , entitled Human rights and bioethics , requested the Sub _ Commission , under the agenda item Human rights and scientific and technological developments , to consider ways of ensuring that the life sciences develop in a manner respectful of human rights and beneficial to humanity as a whole and to make recommendations to that effect .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Review the implementation and effectiveness of the programme of work of the secretariat , and make recommendations to the Commission about future programmes of work , and in this process ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked and Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development , socially and economically disadvantaged groups and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Work closely with other subsidiary organs of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , coordinate activities with them , and ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked , Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a more fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
In addition , the emerging human rights norms relating to the right to development , intergenerational rights , the right to peace , and the right to a safe and healthy environment are areas in which indigenous peoples are beginning to influence old thinking and bring about the progressive development of standards that are more sensitive , responsive and useful to indigenous peoples and humankind generally .  
Of the major changes that have occurred in this century , there is no doubt that one of the most transcendent and revolutionary has been the gradual shift in the area of human rights away from the leading role traditionally played by the State and towards a new vision focused more on human beings than on the authorities wielding power .  
Against this background it is easy to understand the huge significance of the study completed by Mrs . Nicole Questiaux in 1982 , [ 1 ] which determined the conditions and requirements on which the legality of a state of emergency depended and which ensured that proper application thereof is compatible with respect for human rights and with democratic forms of government .  
The second obstacle was the fallacious and perverse argument that the country was experiencing internally a state of dirty , unconventional war compelling the authorities to suspend the exercise of human rights and to claim , before international forums , that international humanitarian law conventions were not applicable since the situation did not involve an international armed conflict and even less a declared war .  
In addition , as the work of both the Human Rights Committee and the regional monitoring bodies and the Special Rapporteur 's experience have shown , international monitoring is not only active but has been reinforced precisely because situations are involved , as has already been demonstrated , human rights stand a greater risk of being violated and require greater protection .  
In the light of the major changes that have occurred in the past 50 years in the sphere of human rights , it is a little surprising to recall that until very recently , and throughout virtually all mankind 's history , the absolute power to determine which rights they allowed their subjects and to establish internal mechanisms for protecting them lay with sovereigns ( monarchs , emperors , etc . ) and later with States .  
It was only in this century , and more particularly after the Second World War , that human rights took on an international dimension as a result of the incorporation of their norms into a great variety of regional and universal treaties and conventions , thereby becoming one of the most dynamic and revolutionary branches of contemporary international public law .  
Fortunately , the opposing view prevailed , as it would have been rather superfluous and even contradictory to promote human rights monitoring activities at international level in ordinary situations , while at the same time denying their applicability during times of crisis or instability , though aware that it is precisely in such situations that the worst violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms most frequently occur . 
This is why both the domestic law of States ( whatever its theoretical foundations ) and international law accept that in such circumstances the competent authorities may suspend the exercise of certain rights for the sole and unique purpose of restoring normality and guaranteeing the exercise of the most fundamental human rights .  
The protective nature of the most fundamental human rights and the defence of institutions which safeguard them and which justify the temporary suspension of certain rights and freedoms explain why international monitoring bodies with increasing precision and clarity have been tying the exercise of this exceptional measure to the defence of democracy , which is understood not only as a particular form of political organization that it is unlawful to attack but as a system that lays down absolute limits for the unfailing observance of certain essential human rights .  
Where this appears most clearly is in severe crisis situations involving relatively serious armed conflicts , where the international law on human rights and international humanitarian law are applied in a simultaneous and complementary manner .  
In short , according to the criteria laid down by the Inter _ American Court , the sole valid justification for states of emergency is the defence of the democratic system , which is understood as a system that affords absolute protection to the constant maintenance of certain essential rights of the human person .  
In most cases , the Committee determined that merely to report the adoption of urgent security measures ( implying severe restrictions on the functioning of institutions and the exercise of human rights ) , on the ground of the alleged existence of a state of emergency , was not sufficient , in conformity with the terms of article 4 of the Covenant , to invoke the right of derogation provided for in strictly defined cases .  
The most valuable lesson that can be drawn from the practice of the international monitoring bodies and from the Special Rapporteur 's own experience is the certainty that , to the extent that the norms and principles governing the state of emergency are respected , its impact on the functioning of the institutions , the validity of the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights will necessarily be limited and compatible with a democratic system of government .  
The Special Rapporteur suggests that special rapporteurs and working groups pay particular attention to the impact of emergency situations on the specific area covered by their respective mandates and that , as the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has repeatedly stated , they should avail themselves of the valuable collaboration which the Special Rapporteur on human rights and states of emergency would be able to provide , in the event that such a Special Rapporteur were to be appointed by the Commission . 
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
While the international law of human rights is , indeed , addressed to the behaviour of States and deals with acts or omissions of government officials 18 / or their agents , modern developments of international humanitarian law , 19 / recent authoritative pronouncements such as indicated in the introductory section of this working paper , 20 / and a respectable body of theory 21 / tend to embrace elements leading to some modification of the traditional position that private individuals or groups are not capable of violating human rights .  
All these elements should , in fact , be sought out and thoroughly explored in order to assess objectively whether ( and , eventually , to what extent ) international human rights law is moving beyond the traditional dichotomy of individual versus State , beyond the duty of States to respect and ensure the observance of human rights , and towards the creation of obligations applicable also to private individuals and other non _ State actors , including liberation movements and terrorist organizations .  
Consequently , and as a next step in its further consideration of the subject , the Sub _ Commission may wish to address _ in the context of the simultaneous interest of these issues for human rights _ the United Nations and other international and regional efforts towards the control of terrorism , as well as measures undertaken at national level , based on information available from all sources .  
It is becoming clear that a State that can address complex social problems , enhance participation in public life and safeguard the rule of law , due process and respect for human rights is a State which " promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable , people-centred development " , in the terms of resolution 50 / 225 .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
The use of a flexible , investigative and monitoring process comparable to that established by ECOSOC resolution 1503 ( XLVIII ) should be examined in the context of population transfers , together with the existing regional machinery for the protection of human rights , including quasi _ legal and political processes such as the Helsinki process , and the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity . 75 .  The Sub-Commission should look into the possibility of establishing an international trust fund for the rehabilitation of the survivors of population transfer .  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
In this spirit , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , deeply alarmed at the widening gap between the rich and the poor , adopted resolution 1993 / 40 in which it entrusted Mr . A . Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels .  
Noting that the current , severe maldistribution of income prevents millions from enjoying economic and social rights and that gross inequalities prevent social harmony , Mr . Eide added that the focus of his report was rather on the impact of different structures of international and national income distribution on human rights . 
In the preliminary report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 14 ) to the Sub-Commission , the Special Rapporteur underlined that income distribution , both internationally and nationally , was the principal indicator of social integration and of the fulfilment of minimum requirements in respect of economic , social and cultural rights , enabling human beings to live in society . 
It was asserted that greater communication between societies would bring growing homogenization of accepted and acceptable " standards " and levels of realization of human rights in general and of economic , social and cultural rights in particular .  
The final objective of the report is to signal the challenges to the human rights system posed by the process of globalization , especially in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The rights of individuals established in codified human rights documents thus constitute the only general criterion for the establishment of minimum acceptable or unacceptable standards in economic and social matters at the national and international levels .  
Pressure for " concrete " results is observed and behavioural models are sought among " profit-making " enterprises without there necessarily being any understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of the processes of human and community development , which by definition cover a more prolonged timespan .  
A framework is thus taking shape of " permanent and persistent violations " of the economic , social and cultural rights of a substantial and increasing majority of the world 's population , threatening the solidarity of international humanitarian principles and human rights .  
Moreover , societies that are increasingly divided into two blocs , the rich and the poor , could not fully enjoy the benefits of their accomplishments because they will constantly be threatened by social strife and internal turmoil , a situation not conducive to the promotion and observance of human rights .  
Among the many activities of the Observer Mission , human rights , humanitarian and public information programmes will be necessary to create conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development .  
It recommended a profound judicial reform that would give the judicial system the capacity to sanction violations of human rights ; constitutional reforms in a number of areas ; the strengthening of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights ; the adoption of reforms in the armed forces and in the public security sector ; the investigation of illegal armed groups , or death squads ; and concrete measures to achieve national reconciliation .  
UNDP , working in close collaboration with ONUSAL , MINUSAL and ONUV and in consultation with the beneficiary organizations , formulated and implemented priority technical assistance programmes in the areas of : administration of justice , public security , reintegration of former combatants and demobilized soldiers , the Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and War-Disabled , the protection of human rights through institutional support of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights , and democratic participation .  
In this respect , they reaffirmed all 10 principles referred to in the Helsinki Final Act : sovereign equality ; respect for rights inherent in sovereignty ; refraining from the threat or use of force ; inviolability of frontiers ; territorial integrity of States ; peaceful settlement of disputes ; non-intervention in internal affairs ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief ; equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; cooperation among States ; and fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law .  
At the national , regional and international levels , judicial human rights bodies continued to develop the legal framework of refugee protection , further defining the scope of obligations towards asylum-seekers and adding content to the rule of non-refoulement , also in respect of persons facing a substantial risk of torture .  
Having due regard to all relevant definitions of the practice of forced evictions under international human rights provisions and instruments , the present Guidelines apply to instances of forced evictions in which there are acts and / or omissions involving the coerced and involuntary removal of individuals , groups and communities from their homes and / or lands and common property resources they occupy or are dependent upon , thus eliminating or limiting the possibility of an individual , group or community residing or working in a particular dwelling , residence or place .  
If , as a last resort , States consider themselves compelled to undertake proceedings of expropriation or compulsory acquisition , such action shall be : ( a ) determined and envisaged by law and norms regarding forced eviction , insofar as these are consistent with internationally recognized human rights ; ( b ) solely for the purpose of protecting the general welfare in a democratic society ; ( c ) reasonable and proportional ; and ( d ) in accordance with the present Guidelines .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development . "  
Confirming that at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , the international community recognized that there was a lack of knowledge about mountain ecosystems and called for renewed international and regional cooperation to develop an integrated approach for conserving , upgrading and using the land , water , plant , animal and human resources and promoting alternative livelihood opportunities for mountain inhabitants with a view to improving their living standards ,  
Encourages Governments and intergovernmental organizations to coordinate regional and international cooperation and facilitate the exchange of information and experience among the specialized agencies and relevant international and regional organizations , research institutions and non _ governmental organizations on the issues related to mountain regions , including the manageability and interaction of mountains and the economy , the impact of mountains on the socio _ economic development of countries , the sustainable human development and the like ;  
It is obvious that the Turkish selective quotations are intended to divert attention from the continuous violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Cyprus by Turkey and , in particular , of the few Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the occupied territory .  
The representative informed the Committee that plans now in place to allow pregnant teenagers to continue their education included working with fathers as appropriate and the provision of functional literacy skills programmes , skills training , parenting classes and family life education , which involved family planning and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) education . 
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .  
The international community must continue to provide technical , economic and financial assistance to support political stability , balanced development , the establishment of democratic institutions and respect for human rights .  
The individual elements of a culture of peace are therefore : non-violence and respect for human rights , respect and solidarity among all peoples and dialogue between cultures , the linkage of peace to democratic participation and sustainable human development , the free flow and sharing of information and knowledge , contribution to conflict-prevention and post-conflict peace-building , and equality between women and men , all best supported through projects in which people take an active role in transforming their values , attitudes and behaviours .  
I have the honour to inform you that your letter dated 8 August 1997 ( S / 1997 / 633 ) concerning your decision to appoint Mr . Reed Brody ( United States of America ) as the third member of the investigative team to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 has been brought to the attention of the members of the Council .  
Debt-relief measures for the least developed countries would help to release scarce resources in order to boost social and human development expenditure and to finance investment in critical economic restructuring in the short term and medium term .  
The right to development was one of the most important human rights , transcending both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights and standing at the nexus formed by democracy , development and respect for human rights .  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
Rising inequality , both within and among countries , and the highly uneven translation of economic growth into equitable human development are causes for major concern for national policy makers and the international community as poverty and social exclusion manifest themselves in , and further exacerbate , crime , disease and urban decay .  
An indigenous participant from South America reported on some activities carried on in the field of indigenous rights and human rights : seminars and workshops had been organized and a number of publications had been distributed with a view to improving understanding of international legal instruments regarding indigenous peoples and monitoring their implementation .  
The transnationals that work in the countries where there are no internal legal frameworks and / or administrative mechanisms that are capable of enforcing and / or providing such involvement of indigenous communities should accept a constructive obligation to respect the guidelines and the fundamental human rights of indigenous peoples . 
The General Assembly is encouraged to direct all of its committees and bodies and draw the attention of other bodies of the United Nations system to the need to mainstream a gender perspective systematically into all areas of their work , in particular in areas such as macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters ( para .  12 ) .  
It is based on the contributions requested by the Division for the Advancement of Women , which focused on additional action taken by the relevant entities in support of the implementation of the Platform for Action since the submission of the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / 51 / 322 ) and on means of implementation , including new human resources , financial means and structural changes .  
Convinced that the increasing danger of racism and racial discrimination must be met by a concerted response by the international community commensurate with the threat posed to the realization of the objective of the Charter of the United Nations to promote universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Decides to authorize Ms . Ferero Ucros to prepare , without financial implications , a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering .  
The objectives of the programme are as follows : ( a ) to establish regional , national and local consensus among the main protagonists ( Governments , civil society , cooperating community and United Nations agencies ) with regard to goals and action for sustainable human development ; ( b ) to strengthen the technical capacity of the programmes and promote joint action by the United Nations system in relation to the strategy ; ( c ) to consolidate ongoing local development processes ; ( d ) to transfer experience at the international level .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
Convinced that the increasing danger of racism and racial discrimination must be met by a concerted response by the international community commensurate with the threat posed to the realization of the objective of the Charter of the United Nations to promote universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining the multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
Acknowledging that indigenous peoples in many countries have been deprived of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and that many of the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples are linked to the historical and continuing deprivation of ancestral rights over lands , territories and resources ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the Purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply concerned that understanding of human nature has been significantly modified by the rapid rise of developments in biotechnology as a science , particularly in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes , and that indigenous people are most vulnerable to the risk of being singled out for human genetic research and human gene patenting by the biotechnology industry ,  
Takes note of the work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization in the field of the human genome to complete the preliminary draft of a universal declaration on the human genome and human rights , a standard _ setting framework urgently needed to ensure that such research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human dignity , in particular for the dignity and way of life of indigenous peoples ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
Having considered the final report of Mr . Leandro Despouy on Protection of human rights during states of emergency and the tenth annual list of States which , since 1 January 1985 , have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 19 and Add . 1 ) ,  
As a result , the aim of the Funds political empowerment programme is to address the obstacles and challenges that prevent women from contributing their vision to a new world of equality , development and peace and from participating in its construction under the framework of universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated human rights .  
Operationally , the UNIDO work programmes were based on the following thematic priorities : formulation of strategies and institution-building for global economic integration ; innovation , productivity and quality to increase competitiveness ; industrial information , investment and technology promotion ; human resource development with special attention to the integration of women in industrial development ; rural industrial development ; and industry-related environment and energy issues .  
During the FAO regional conference for Latin America and the Caribbean , held in Paraguay in July 1996 , it had been determined that , based on available natural , human and technological resources , the region could set two complementary goals for the year 2010 : to reduce malnutrition from 15 per cent in the period 1991-1992 to 6 per cent , and to ensure that the nutrition supply should be no less than 2,700 calories per person per day in any country .  
The attempt to change the meaning of food security from being a basic human right to mere participation in the global markets , which by definition excluded all those lacking adequate purchasing power , was contrary to that principle .  
In line with the objectives of the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa , the international community and the United Nations system must strengthen industrial development cooperation for African industrialization in the areas of industrial policy , investment , transfer of technology , institutional and human resource development , and the development of small - and medium-scale industry .  Support was also required for the promotion of regional and sub-regional cooperation as a practical means of enlarging markets and establishing multinational projects .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Taking note also of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
This duty is impaired when institutions fail to comply with their legal obligation to provide , in a timely manner , for appropriate means of guaranteeing full respect for human rights or of carrying out prompt , exhaustive and effective investigations when such rights are violated .  
Activities will focus on strengthening government capacity , at the central and local levels , for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform and institutional and human resource development ; improving performance in the public sector ; and introducing efficient and accountable managerial systems , structures and information technologies in accordance with national development objectives .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their international obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , as established at the Managua meeting , is an ambitious and comprehensive initiative guided by the principles of respect for life ; peace ; democracy ; the observance of human rights ; economic integration ; and the responsibility of succeeding generations for sustainable development ( A / 49 / 580-S / 1994 / 1217 , annex I ) .  
In the area of economic and social development , UNDP has focused on the formulation and implementation of a new initiative known as the Programme for the Promotion of Human Sustainable Development in Central America ( PROGRESS / CA ) , aiming at establishing regional , local and national consensus among the main social actors ( Governments , civil societies , international donors / NGOs and United Nations agencies ) on goals and actions towards human sustainable development .  
With regard to the efforts to restructure UNHCR , his delegation supported the measures to increase its efficiency , while stressing that any lasting solution would have to be based on national , regional and international solidarity , which entailed the mobilization of considerable financial and human resources .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
It was agreed that inter-agency coordination could be pursued by creating an interactive electronic mail network for information-sharing to serve as the medium for inter-agency contacts ; preparing an inventory of social programmes and projects ; conducting joint human resource training activities ; expanding to the rest of the region the system developed by CEFIR for observing the behaviour of social actors in integration ; and comparing the various work programmes in order to identify issues appropriate for inter-agency cooperation .  
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed that all human beings were born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone was entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration without distinction of any kind such as race , colour or national origin , yet violations continued daily .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
The international community was currently facing different , although not unfamiliar , problems , namely , the break-up of political entities , conflicts based on religious ideology , the repercussions of the apartheid policies applied in the past and human rights violations engendered by racial and ethnic hatred .  
The campaign to promote awareness of human rights and humanitarian principles was also worth mentioning for , unless discipline was maintained among the armed forces and unless universal ethical principles were upheld , protection of victims could never be established on a solid basis . 
Successful enterprise development is affected by a conducive economic environment in terms of the macroeconomic , regulatory and legal frameworks , the structural characteristics of the national economy , the degree of market development , the institutional framework , the infrastructural and human resource base and the quality and coherence of government policies .  
Rather , we are appealing to the conscience of the continent , as well as to individual consciences , asking that these acts of violence not be repeated , that the truth be known , that justice prevail , that the human person be respected and that the United Nations and the non-governmental organizations be permitted to work under the protection of full respect for international humanitarian law .  
This view includes situations of extreme poverty and economic and social under-development , human rights violations , massive flows of refugees , civil wars resulting from ethnic conflicts , extreme degradation of the environment , terrorism , and even certain socio-political phenomena such as corruption , drug trafficking and international crime ; it also includes religious fundamentalism , which in recent years has aggressively invaded several regions of the world . 
Africa now needs to address three main requirements : first , the striving for the peaceful settlement of conflicts occurring in a number of its regions , as well as for urgent solutions to the problems of refugees ; secondly , the achievement of economic and social development and the enhancement of integration , both at the level of the continent as a whole and on the level of subregional groupings ; and thirdly , the turn to democratization and to the respect for human rights by African communities .  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
I am pleased to announce my own plans to visit the continent before the end of the year , to meet with leaders and people there and to make as real as I can America 's commitment to stand with Africans as they realize long-delayed aspirations for true freedom , growing prosperity and simple human dignity .  
This Union will enable all Central American social sectors to take full advantage of the region 's strategic geographical location , economic potential , vast ecological wealth and robust and abundant human resources within the new international order , and to confront the challenges of the next millennium .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
We are convinced that a renewed effort to promote complete , integrated and democracy-based education in Latin America and the Caribbean in a context of growing interdependence , technological development and globalization will help strengthen democratic civic culture on the basis of the full and effective enjoyment of human rights .  
It also invited all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardized the friendly relations among States , hindered development of international cooperation and resulted in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
The devastation and the destruction , as well as the human tragedy resulting from years and years of unrelenting ethnic hatred , witnessed in the fragmented former Yugoslavia ; the division of Cyprus ; the sanctions imposed by the Security Council on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , which continue to have far-reaching effects on neighbouring countries ; the recent turmoil in Albania ; and political instability in some countries because of rampant extremist fundamentalist elements , these are matters of great concern to all the littoral States of the Mediterranean .  
At the social level , living conditions are characterized by poor nutrition , resulting from low purchasing power , and poor health conditions , with widespread disease , including tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
This high level of attrition at a stage when continuing learning is both optimal and desirable represents , from an educational and manpower planning perspective , a wasted national opportunity to expand and strengthen the human resource pool for the enhancement of national productivity .  
Without seeking to be exhaustive in the present interim report , the Special Rapporteur would nevertheless like to bring to the attention of the General Assembly a number of allegations of human rights violations transmitted to him during the period under consideration , particularly as regards the right to life and physical integrity , arrests and arbitrary detentions and torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .  
In the broad context of the complicated general situation in Africa , the Security Council decided to devote special attention to the situation in the Republic of Sierra Leone , as part of the international community 's effort over the past three years through the United Nations , in coordination with the Organization of African Unity , subregional organizations and the Governments of the region to restore pluralistic and representative democracy , and promote respect for human rights and peace and national reconciliation in that country . 
The City and its Palestinian population have been subjected to human rights violations resulting from concerted and accelerated efforts by the Israeli authorities to create facts on the ground , such as those affecting the demographic and geographic balance in the city , which would be , if allowed to continue unabated , clearly to the advantage of its Jewish population and have negative implications for the Palestinians , placing them before a fait accompli and pre-empting their future efforts to challenge Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem . 
A key component of its work is to assist national institutions in playing an effective role in the promotion and protection of human rights at the national level and to forge close links with international bodies pursuing the same goal .  
The present report has highlighted the growing role of independent national institutions in promoting and protecting human rights , a factor increasingly recognized as important in ensuring effective implementation of international human rights standards at the national level .  
The Assembly appealed to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights3 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
Further , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
The main objectives of the Institute are : to raise public awareness for human rights ; to further educate civil servants , teachers , lawyers on human rights ; to strengthen human rights education in the Cyprus educational system at all levels ; to strengthen the capacity of the mass media for human rights education by appropriate means ; to promote the active engagement of national non-governmental organizations in the realization of the goals of the Decade ; and to establish a human rights library in order to enhance public awareness .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups , such as human rights monitors , judges and lawyers , prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , journalists , and national and local non-governmental organizations undertaken by the Office and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
The aims of the training course were to familiarize participants with the international and regional systems of protection of human rights and procedures to be followed for the preparation of relevant reports , and to provide participants with the requested training tools in order to guarantee an element of continuity through the replication of training at the national level for relevant governmental departments .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty and the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society , and the creation of more and better jobs , requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
The need for an integrated and intersectoral approach to health strategies has been recognized , as well as the importance of strengthening national and international efforts to prevent and combat epidemics and other diseases that are endemic in many developing countries , and in particular to address malaria and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) more effectively .  
National plans of action and other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by Governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing owing to a number of complex factors which include armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources and environmental degradation .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
Those countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies that take into account social development goals , as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to the Agenda .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management effectively to utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
To recognize the ethnic and cultural existence of Argentine indigenous peoples ; to guarantee respect for identity and the right to bilingual and cross-cultural education ; to recognize the legal personality of indigenous communities and community ownership of the land they traditionally occupy ; to establish regulations for the handing over of other land that is suitable and sufficient for human development , none such land being inalienable , transmissible or subject to taxes or charges ; and to guarantee their participation in the management of their natural resources and other matters of interest to them .  
In resolution 1997 / 57 , section IX , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on the prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and other vulnerable groups , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
By monitoring sensitive trials and intervening with the responsible authorities , the Special Rapporteur and staff of UNHCR have played an active role in supporting the efforts of the Human Rights Coordination Centre of OHR to deter human rights abuses and build confidence in the legal system .  
The present legal and institutional framework through which legislative , executive and judicial powers continued to be exercised in Myanmar was not in conformity with established international norms governing human rights .  
This structured programme of technical cooperation in the field of human rights involves the principal elements of the administration of justice and legal reform ; penitentiary administration ; training and institutional support ; and genocide response and vulnerable groups .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
One of the principal reasons cited for the current situation of human rights in Afghanistan was the lack of central power , governmental institutions , unified legal system and a clear social , political and economic system .  
It was stated that numerous human rights violations stemmed from the absence of a functioning State system , including social development programmes and a national treasury to pay the salaries of civil servants .  
An important medium of education and the heightening of awareness has been the " New Home , New Life " radio series developed by Mr . John Butt of the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) , which incorporates cultural , social , economic , human rights , peace , health , conflict resolution , mine awareness and other issues of vital daily importance for the population of Afghanistan .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
By monitoring sensitive trials and intervening with the responsible authorities , the Special Rapporteur and staff of the High Commissioner for Human Rights have played an active role in supporting the efforts of the Human Rights Coordination Centre of the Office of the High Representative to deter human rights abuses and build confidence in the legal system .  
The IPTF investigation concluded that the west Mostar police had used excessive force , in violation of national and international human rights standards , and that they had attempted to cover up the facts of the incident .  
If , by a democratic regime , we mean one in which human rights are respected , power is vested in the Government by the people through free elections , there is a separation of powers , the law is enforced by the authorities , there is equality under the law , the armed forces and police are at the service of everyone , the courts perform their functions independently , political parties express themselves freely , and there is freedom of the press , then this report shows that none of these conditions are being met .  
The new State structure , based on an omnipresent state party ( although this is denied ) , the absence of a short - , medium - or long-term democratic project , and the fact that there is nobody capable of controlling the exercise of power all lead the Special Rapporteur to conclude that the Congolese people do not enjoy , and will not enjoy in the foreseeable future , the human right to democracy .  
In view of the continuing widespread violations of human rights in Kosovo as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the opening of an office of the High Commissioner in Prishtina , as well as an increased presence of other international organizations , would be indispensable for gathering reliable information on future human rights developments .  
Since governmental and non-governmental organizations and individuals have important roles to play in ensuring that human rights are respected , national human rights education strategies and plans of action should be developed and implemented by a creative mixture of all of such entities .  These Guidelines are not intended as a blueprint for a nationally coordinated effort in human rights education .  
The study might also include ( a ) knowledge about human rights among the general population , as well as potential target groups ; ( b ) social , political and economic conditions relevant to human rights education ; ( c ) human rights educational access for marginalized groups ; and ( d ) treatment of human rights issues by the mass media ( including television , radio , newspapers and popular magazines ) .  
At its fiftieth session , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 182 of 22 December 1995 , entitled Human rights and mass exoduses , in which it , inter alia , acknowledged that mass exoduses of populations were caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation .  
United Nations treaty bodies , special rapporteurs , representatives and independent experts have regularly provided valuable information on specific human rights problems having the potential of generating mass exoduses or preventing their resolution , together with recommendations for corrective measures .  
As regards prevention , the CIS countries are encouraged to ratify and implement relevant international instruments , make use of the existing procedures and mechanisms established by international bodies and establish national institutions responsible for monitoring and promoting the protection of human rights .  
An effective human rights regime , secured by institutions that support the rule of law , including an independent judicial system accessible to all and an accountable public administration , is also of paramount importance for the creation of a stable society and thus conducive to consolidating peace and preventing the recurrence of mass exodus .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
In paragraphs 20 and 21 of resolution 1997 / 66 , the Commission requested the Special Representative " to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate " and to report on these matters to the upcoming sessions of the Assembly and Commission .  
Given the tremendous scale and severity of the violations of human rights and humanitarian law that were perpetrated during the traumatic days of the Rwandan civil war in 1994 - a time which saw the brutal carrying out of one of this century 's worst genocides - and the weak response of the international community at this critical time in Rwanda 's history , the Government is to be commended for its cooperation with the members of the international community active in human rights matters in Rwanda .  
They declared themselves in favour of a new and more democratic world order based on the strengthening of collective security and the development of cooperation in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres and in the defence of human rights .  
The 1996 special seminars organized by the Office of Legal Affairs and UNITAR covered the following topics : 13 ( a ) International protection of human rights ; ( b ) International humanitarian law ; ( c ) Refugee law ; ( d ) International law and sustainable development ; ( e ) International economic law ; ( f ) World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system ; ( g ) International environmental law ; and ( h ) Law of the sea .  
These UNESCO Chairs play an active role in upgrading the knowledge of basic values of human rights , democracy and peace at the university level and at the same time serve as focal points for promoting education for peace , tolerance and international understanding at all educational levels .  
Thus , while the Government of the Republic of Angola regrets once again the fact that , in spite of the numerous General Assembly resolutions , among others , not one positive measure has been taken to lift the embargo , it urges the international community to cooperate with the United Nations in order to put an end , as soon as possible , to that blockade , whose main victims are thousands of human beings who are forced to make extraordinary sacrifices and see their social and economic development hindered .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1997 / 57 in which it requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect , all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
Although hampered by financial and administrative constraints , the field operation has successfully accomplished a number of tasks , including compiling information on the human rights situation ; verifying information received , including through investigative missions ; alerting the Special Rapporteur to trends and developments so that she might take timely action ; and organizing the Special Rapporteurs missions .  
Prevention and preparedness strategies , based on scientific and technological applications as well as on social equity , and including the full involvement of civil society , must be put in place to protect national assets and property and especially to reduce human suffering , the loss of life , and the disruption of livelihoods .  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Strongly urges all Governments to guarantee the respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the right to life , and to take urgent measures to prevent the killing of children living and / or working on the streets and to combat torture and violence against them , and to ensure strict compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant human rights instruments , including the requirement that legal and juridical processes respect the rights of the child ;  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
Finally , all States of the region are invited to address , through various forms of cooperation , terrorism , international crime and illicit drug production and trafficking , as factors jeopardizing friendly relations between States , hindering the development of international cooperation , and , above all , resulting in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
UNDP will help to expand a current IDB , World Bank and ECLAC regional programme aimed at improving household surveys and the capacity of countries to measure living standards and poverty conditions , a key instrument for the design and monitoring of public policies in the context of sustainable human development .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip the Arab societies with greater capacity to reduce the lack of access to reliable sources of energy as a barrier to economic growth and human development , with a special focus on poor , remote areas and women , through the effective management of the supply and demand side of the issue .  
At the regional level , in support of subregional and national actions , the programme will explore innovative approaches to the interconnected issues of governance , gender and poverty and will advance the application of the human development index ( pioneered by the earlier phase of the regional programme ) to incorporate an understanding of the impact of the epidemic .  
In an indicative list , the Council identified macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters as areas where gender mainstreaming needs to be pursued systematically .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
It was realistic in that it focused on concrete partnerships and practical solutions , and would tap the human , technological and financial resources which had been beyond the reach of the United Nations , and which had become far greater than official development assistance .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Although an express prohibition of arbitrary displacement is contained in international humanitarian law ( Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols ) and in the law relating to indigenous peoples , in human rights law , by contrast , the prohibition is only implicit in various provisions , particularly in the rights to freedom of movement , choice of residence and housing , and freedom from arbitrary interference with ones home .  
The objectives of this project are to help to formulate sound human development policies through : ( a ) the preparation of national human development reports , combined with an annual regional human development report ; and ( b ) the development of improved statistics on human development indicators , including reports on social trends by countries , the latter in close cooperation with ECE . 13 .  Subregional workshops will bring together specialists responsible for national human development reports and from the national statistical offices .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
While significance of national and regional characteristics and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
In order to take effective legislative and political measures to ensure equality between women and men , Bulgaria had adopted a national plan of action in 1996 aimed at protecting the human rights of women , improving their economic and social status , eradicating female poverty , promoting the participation of women in decision-making , improving the health of women and eliminating all forms of violence against women . 
The special difficulties involved in investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in circumstances of internal armed conflict and the prevailing limitations in this respect in Rwanda should be explicitly recognized in the reports of the Field Operation .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
The preparation of a high-resolution digital mosaic of the ice sheet and exposed portions of the continent will help to better understand why changes in the ice sheet occur , providing more insight into the effects of human activity and global warming on the rapid retreat of large portions of the shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula .  
For instance , the Tribunal 's activities involve field investigative work which frequently is fraught with personal risks to the investigative teams and their confidential sources ; custody , care and local as well as international transport of detainees who must be treated as high security risks at all times while at the same time respecting their basic human rights as detainees in a prison facility ; likewise for the witnesses , whose cooperation is essential to the successful prosecution of cases before the Tribunal .  
The Team has directly raised awareness about Pacific island Constitutions , laws , human rights , gender and the application of United Nations Conventions among rural and urban women , youth groups , civil society activists , social welfare officers , police officers , religious seminarians , magistrates , justices , senior court judges and other providers of the justice system in the Cook Islands , Fiji , the Federated States of Micronesia , Kiribati , the Marshall Islands , Nauru , Niue , Samoa , the Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu and Vanuatu .  
The return and sustainability of investments in physical capital appeared to be higher when done together with those in human and social capital to counteract rapid technological change and inappropriate socio-economic organization at local level .  
The issue of human rights was of particular importance for Kuwait , because the entire population was suffering as a result of the delay by the Iraqi regime in freeing prisoners and detainees from Kuwait and elsewhere , as well as its uncooperative attitude at the meetings in Geneva of the Tripartite Commission and of its technical committee .  14 .  The human , social and psychological consequences of the Iraqi occupation continued to be felt .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Stresses its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries , and reaffirms that the satisfaction of basic human needs is an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and equal opportunities for participation in political , economic , cultural and social life ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Convinced of the necessity of protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and determined to take new steps forward , nationally and with the increased cooperation and solidarity of the international community , with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights ,  
Stressing the fact that realization of the full range of human rights requires effective policies and compliance at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Calls upon relevant United Nations organs and agencies - in the light of the principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - to make , within their respective mandates and fields of action , an assessment of , and to put forward pertinent conclusions on , the state of implementation and the impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of training , dissemination and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Strongly urges all Governments to guarantee the respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the right to life , and to take urgent measures to prevent the killing of children living and / or working on the streets and to combat torture and violence against them , and to ensure strict compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant human rights instruments , including the requirement that legal and juridical processes respect the rights of the child ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Recalling its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , in particular Commission resolution 1997 / 75 of 18 April 1997 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , [ 1 ] which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people ,  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Welcomes the efforts of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to contribute to the creation of an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , and broad-based programmes of human rights education , and strengthening of local non-governmental organizations through programmes of advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons , enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expressions , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
Further recalling that in order to promote development equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular the numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , such as refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
Activities in this field have included conducting and coordinating trial monitoring activities ; providing human rights expertise to the expert team for criminal justice reform ; supporting a project on a judicial training institute ; and conducting a project to provide suspects with lawyers familiar with international human rights law .  
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
Calls upon both the landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours to implement measures to strengthen further their cooperative and collaborative efforts , including bilateral cooperation , in dealing with transit issues , inter alia , by improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral and subregional agreements to govern transit transport operations , developing joint ventures in the area of transit transport and strengthening institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport , and , in this respect , notes that South-South cooperation also plays an important role in this field ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
Paragraph 22.2 should read : " The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with the human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
In its paragraph 5 , Part I , the Vienna Declaration and Programme of action recalled that All human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated and , in paragraph 98 , Part II , that to strengthen the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , additional approaches should be examined , such as a system of indicators to measure progress in the realization of the rights set forth in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
What is needed , with regard to the effective promotion and protection of those rights , is for the Organization and its Member States to take more decisive steps towards the inalienable right to development , understood not only as economic growth but also as eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of the basic material and spiritual needs of the human being in conditions of equal opportunity .  
In order to raise awareness of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Department carries on a multi _ media approach to ensure the effective coverage of this issue as well as worldwide distribution of relevant public information materials on human rights .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolution 1996 / 28 , decided to transmit the revised draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission , Mr . Theo van Boven to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration .  
If it is decided to broaden the scope of application of the basic principles and guidelines to include all violations , and all the more so if that alternative is rejected , it would seem essential for the document to explain what is meant by gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , which constitute crimes under international law .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .  
The Government of Sweden warmly welcomes the draft revised basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and wishes to express its deep appreciation of the dedicated work performed by the former Special Rapporteur , Mr . Theo van Boven .  
Hence , should the right to reparation be limited to gross violations , the correct wording under public international law would be : gross violations of human rights and grave breaches and other serious violations of international humanitarian law .  
In the view of the League of Arab States , far from being limited to a specific part of the world , the dangerous consequences of terrorism will spread throughout the entire world unless there is international coordination and cooperation to combat this phenomenon , which unquestionably constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights .  
Given that terrorism posed a stumbling block to worldwide social , economic and political development and was , moreover , a violation of human rights , concerted international efforts should be made to eliminate it .  
The Advisory Committee was not provided with adequate justification for the posts being requested in relation to the programme of work for the completion of all outstanding areas of the peace accords mentioned in paragraph 3 of the statement of the Secretary-General on programme budget implications ( i.e . , public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , protection of the wounded and disabled and legislative reform ) .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Paragraph 1 ( a ) of the note describes the qualities of the person to assume that position , which include high moral standing and personal integrity ; expertise , including in the field of human rights ; and the general knowledge and understanding of diverse cultures necessary for impartial , objective , non-selective and effective performance of the duties of the High Commissioner .  
Furthermore , on the subject of human rights , our countries have also gone through a difficult and often painful process in their transition to democracy and in the quest for fundamental human rights , a process that resulted in sad and tragic episodes but also taught valuable lessons that can and should be shared with other parts of the world .  
We , the United Nations Member States and observer States , have agreed to adopt the Agenda for Development , thus holding forth a global promissory note and universal hope for the millions of our people throughout the entire world who daily go without sufficient food and water , who battle diseases and natural disasters , who can not read or write , who lack shelter , who are jobless , whose entire lives are stunted and who are deprived of the simple pleasures of human existence because of poverty . 
It also reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development .  
The European Union accordingly supports unreservedly MINUGUA activities aimed at strengthening Guatemala \ x { e5b8 } institutions ; those activities focus most particularly on the legal system , public security , and the promotion of a multicultural , multilingual and multiethnic State , on education and promotion regarding the peace agreements and their dissemination , and on the creation of a national climate conducive to respect for human rights .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 11 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably ' with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out ' .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue , within existing resources , to cooperate with the appropriate regional organizations and to provide policy advice and technical assistance , especially in capacity-building , to countries with economies in transition , tailored to each country 's respective economic and social needs in the field of housing and human settlements , and paying special attention , inter alia , to :  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
The Centre established a comprehensive data base on non-governmental organizations and other partners active in human settlements and is expanding its programme with those partners which had participated actively in the Habitat II preparatory process and had organized their own forums and presented their declarations and commitments to Committee II of the Conference . 11 .  At the present time , the main operational activity of the Centre in relation to the Global Strategy for Shelter , is the application of the urban and housing indicators .  
This will be possible only if the Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic tasks the maintenance of international peace and security and comprehensive economic and social development , particularly in developing countries and to ensure broad respect for the promotion and protection of individual and collective human rights . 
Respect for human rights is achieved not only through the functioning of instruments to monitor compliance with international treaties but also through political , social and economic measures that allow human rights to become an integral part of social development and a part of the everyday life of each individual .  
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
We have taken substantial strides towards the ideal of peace and security ; strengthened and broadened the observance of human rights ; enhanced and developed international law and widened the scope of international penal law , in particular ; and laid the foundations for greater responsibility by States in the advancement of social progress .  
On the contrary , they have become even more marginalized in the global economy for the very simple reason that they lack the physical , financial and human resources as well as the institutional infrastructure necessary for effective competition and integration in the international markets .  
While remaining faithful to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter the maintenance of international peace and security , cooperation for economic , social and cultural development , defence of human rights , and humanitarian assistance the United Nations should also promote and pursue a reform process which takes into account the many changes that have taken place in a complex international scene .  
But I feel that it is appropriate to repeat the principal characteristic of our development model , which is a harmonious and rational complementary relationship between economic and social policies , which for the first time in many years is enabling us to carry out a realistic strategy for sustainable human development .  
In seeking to enhance its participation in such regional and international institutions , the United Arab Emirates , thanks to the wise guidance of its Head of State , His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan , has achieved a qualitative and quantitative leap in the developmental , economic , social , environmental and human fields in the past two decades .  
The Ecuadorian State is committed to following this line of conduct and to promoting and protecting all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , including the right to development .  
We must be prepared to face other kinds of war : social war against poverty ; judicial war against organized crime ; political war against interventionism in our sovereign economies ; and moral war against the violation of human rights . 
Accordingly , he continuously advocated in his lifetime the creation of a new global human order premised on sustainable economic development , equity and social and ecological justice , and based on the creation of a separate global development fund for assistance to both the North and the South .  
By building peace , reducing unsustainable military expenditures , promoting equitable and sustainable development and encouraging stable , democratic societies which respect human rights , we not only limit human suffering , but we also address the root causes of conflict itself .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
Our commitment to the setting up of such a court stems from the fact that this court would be a landmark development in the creation of a balanced and effective system aimed at ensuring that international crimes , especially mass violations of basic fundamental human rights , do not remain unpunished .  
Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
The Secretary-General 's reform initiative is the most comprehensive attempt to date at fashioning the United Nations of tomorrow into an instrument capable of serving the common interests of all peoples , guided by the enduring tenets of peace , human rights , the rule of law and social progress , enshrined in the Charter more than half a century ago .  
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the few countries that from time immemorial , owing to its geostrategic placement and its vast human and natural resources , has borne the burden of a sombre history of suffering and outrageous violations of human rights and the rights of peoples .  
In 1885 , when Africa was being colonized , my country was set up as a State that was the personal property of the King of the Belgians ; it endured violence and blatant violations of human rights connected inter alia with the exploitation of red rubber and other kinds of forced labour . 
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
Every new charge made by Cuba is supported by more than $ 60-billion in losses and that is not a full assessment by an economy distorted by the war conditions imposed on us , and by the incalculable human , physical and psychological damage we have sustained .  
All of this madness has revived official and covert operations , mercenaries , spies and assassins , as ready now as in the worst days of the cold war to plot and unleash terror against human beings and even employ aggressive biological agents against our economy .  
And we all have an obligation to work towards maintaining international peace and security ; achieving international cooperation in solving economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems ; and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms .  
On the contrary , it means adjusting these lofty aims to the new realities of a multifaceted world and also making the Organization no matter how different its separate parts are the mainstream of human development , where the economic well-being of people brings to an end age-old ills such as starvation and epidemic diseases , as well as huge environmental threats , and which helps to achieve multilateral understanding between those participating in this development .  
While I would certainly acknowledge that some of the international community 's concern has been justified , I would like very much to say that the Republic of Belarus is a sovereign State that develops its own policy with due regard for the opportunities economic , social , moral and psychological of its citizens , within the limits of international patterns of behaviour and with respect for human rights and personal freedoms . 
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
We note that , unfortunately , our neighbour , Turkey , is indulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep historical , religious and human relations between Iraq and Turkey . Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate our sovereignty , interfere in our internal affairs and invade our territory , on the basis of flimsy pretexts .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
This is a space devoid of the most basic human values ; a space in which children are slaughtered , raped and maimed ; a space in which children are exploited as soldiers ; a space in which children are starved and exposed to extreme brutality .  
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .  
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing interest in establishing or strengthening existing national human rights institutions , as a constructive way to take positive action at the national level , bearing in mind national circumstances , to promote respect for human rights .  Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
A credible and independent human rights commission , along with a genuinely independent national electoral commission , could make an important contribution to protecting stability and promoting the observance of human rights in Cambodia in the lead-up to what we strongly hope will be free , fair and credible elections in May next year .  
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
At the internal level , the relation between the Government and its citizens is based , as I said before , on constitutional legitimacy ; on equality among all citizens , whether male or female ; on equality in rights and obligations of men and women alike ; on the freedom of individuals and groups ; on the freedom of association to parties , trade unions and civilian community organizations ; on freedom of the press ; and on the protection of human rights .  
Yet while today it is the Congolese people who are hostages , perhaps tomorrow it will be another people 's turn to be taken hostage by a political class that is driven by selfish ambitions , unprepared to accept the rules of democracy and uninterested in seeking and maintaining peace .  Every day and at an increasing human cost , the excessive demands of some and the lack of tolerance of others defer to a later date the establishment of conditions for a negotiated peace .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
While our strong commitment to social policy has paid rich dividends , as illustrated by the successive high rankings of Barbados in the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) human development index , emerging problems largely associated with poverty , particularly among youth , are of critical concern .  
It is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly the contradictory positions of some of our members , who purport to be champions and defenders of human rights issues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations that directly deny genuine democratic representation and the rights of people to govern themselves in a manner consistent with their political aspirations . 
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
Through the three-pronged approach adopted by the Summit , States committed themselves to pursuing the objective of eradicating poverty in the world , promoting full employment as a fundamental public-policy priority and promoting social integration by fostering stable , safe and just societies on the basis of respect for human rights , non-discrimination and the closest possible involvement of all in decisions affecting their well-being .  
Within this overall conceptual construct , the Summit resolved to create a framework for policy and action at the national , regional and international levels geared to the promotion of social progress , justice and the betterment of the human condition .  
However , national , regional and international efforts have not yet succeeded in transforming the social situation of today \ x { e5b8 } world , which is marked by major disparities in income and by the extreme poverty that affects the lives of billions of human beings .  
Thailand therefore agrees with the importance of the people-centred approach to development put forward by the Copenhagen Summit , which emphasizes that development can not be sustained in the long run if it is based only on purely physical economic growth , without due consideration of human and other social and environmental dimensions .  
The Action Strategy begins with measures representing a set of possible early priority interventions , including land title reform ; a new agricultural development initiative and special agricultural economic zones ; promotion of new manufacturing investment through relocation of labour-intensive industries to create industrial estates in the region ; introduction of modern and appropriate technologies ; marketing systems ; and human resource development , including improved skills . 
It is the aim of the Jamaican Government to develop adequate employment opportunities , matched by improvements in the skills and literacy of our human resources , recognizing that an effectively trained , adaptable and flexible work force is critical if we are to meet the demands of the economy .  
It focuses on strengthening the institutional capacities of the Government at both central and local levels , policy management and poverty monitoring , promoting human resources development through providing better access to health and education opportunities , alleviating rural poverty , good governance and developing and strengthening the basic social safety net .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation \ x { e5b8 } sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help generate renewed political will at the national , regional and international levels to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
Targeting policies at the most vulnerable groups of society children , women , the elderly , the disadvantaged , the poor , the disabled is , moreover , a prerequisite for the successful realization of social justice , equity and respect for human dignity .  
Likewise , in keeping with a modern , integrated concept , the Romanian Government has approached social issues in close relation with economic growth and the complex factors involved in sustainable human development .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
The mission , in its broadest sense , must coordinate and implement humanitarian relief , civil affairs , electoral assistance , police and judicial reorganization , human rights and economic and social reconstruction actions that must be sustained long after the guns have been silenced .  
The purpose was to begin to create a new human being with stronger moral values and principles , a human being who is more tolerant of differences , more productive economically , with ideals , loyalty and virtue in political matters and embracing social unity ; in sum , to try to alter elements that are deeply rooted in a population , as well as those that are emerging .  
We hope that the international community of States , non-governmental organizations , civil society , religious groups and local bodies will , together , work vigorously to promote education and awareness so that peace and tolerance may prevail throughout the world , together with a diversity of opinions and ideas and respect for basic human rights , including the right to physical and moral integrity .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .  
We are witnessing on a daily basis the resurgence of intolerance , violence and non-respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; incitements to hatred are spreading to many corners of the planet ; many peoples are still oppressed and are unacquainted with the great benefit of freedom ; and international disputes which must be resolved exclusively by peaceful means , in accordance with the San Francisco Charter are continuing , imperilling peace and security .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
The collective campaign of the world community to define , promote and protect human rights across the globe represents a great achievement of humanity at large and needs to be cherished by all ; however , the imperative of a balanced approach to all aspects of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , should not be theoretically underestimated or practically neglected .  
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
The Rwanda Tribunal is faced with the very difficult task of adjudicating persons responsible for the most egregious crimes imaginable by the human mind : the crime of genocide , crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
Adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights only three years after the establishment of the United Nations reflected a common understanding that fundamental freedoms and respect for human dignity provide the most solid foundation for peace , democracy , development and fruitful international cooperation in every field of human activity .  
The reform proposed by the Secretary-General is aimed at strengthening the leadership role of the Secretary-General , improving coordination among the various bodies active in each field , such as peace and security , economic and social affairs , development , human rights and humanitarian affairs , and ensuring greater cooperation among the different departments and programmes , in order to achieve a fully integrated and interactive United Nations .  
Central America has made great progress in demilitarization and in the strengthening of civil society , holding free , transparent and pluralist elections ; integrating former combatants into national political processes ; strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law ; and implementing a development programme whose central focus is the human being .  
The denial of basic human rights , the confiscation of one 's rightful property and ancestral home , the denial of free movement , the obstruction of necessary economic activity , the importation of thousands of foreigners to be settled in confiscated land in occupied territory , the systematic and deliberate splitting of the West Bank through streams of bypass highways and indiscriminately placed settlements all these , in our view , amount to a clear record of violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli authorities .  
During these last five years our initial predictions concerning sustainable development have been justified insofar as this process has proved to be a very complex global endeavour embodying all aspects of human life and requiring awareness and active participation at all levels .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
Empirical evidence suggests that the countries that have been successful in sustaining capital inflows and long-term growth are those that have systematically upgraded their human capital and infrastructure and have promoted the continuous diversification or deepening of their domestic productive base .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .  
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action3 reaffirmed basic principles governing international human rights activities , set out specific goals on a wide number of areas and identified various methods to achieve them .  
At its fiftieth session , the Commission adopted resolution 1994 / 45 , entitled The question of integrating the rights of women into the human rights mechanism of the United Nations and the elimination of violence against women , in which inter alia , it called for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status of women and the human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms .  
In its resolution 1996 / 51 , the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ third session an update of the report of the Secretary-General on human rights and mass exoduses ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 42 ) , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to that resolution , as well as all relevant information on the human rights situations creating or affecting refugees and displaced persons .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled " Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights " , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
The Government considered that the use of force , foreign occupation or domination , and unilateral economic coercion or international sanctions to resolve conflicts , halt violations of human rights and promote democracy , were factors in creating refugees and mass exoduses .  
The Note outlined several elements indispensable in protection-based comprehensive approaches to avoiding mass displacement , such as upholding the international rule of law , including relevant human rights and refugee law principles , which should be seen as positive and enabling components of any comprehensive approach .  
The United Nations Department for Public Information ( DPI ) highlighted the important role of public information in raising awareness of the question of human rights and mass exodus , highlighting activities such as the production of print material , films , radio and television programmes and radio documentaries , as well as collaborating with NGOs and coordinating inter-agency promotional activities .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
As regards future prospects , the Government of Russia recalled the importance of combined efforts of concerned States and international organizations and called for steps to raise standards in human rights and minorities protection , to consolidate civil society and national harmony and promote tolerance and mutual respect among all strata of the population - ultimately for the good of democracy , the supremacy of law , and stability .  
UNHCR also noted the continuing cooperation and information _ sharing with the relevant mechanism of the Commission , specifically noting the logistical support and information-sharing and collaboration with United Nations human rights field missions , which it considered to be an important means of addressing the root causes issues and an integral part of comprehensive solutions .  
In addition to taking preventive action , the High Commissioner is seeking to take action regarding durable solutions , such as attempting to create an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , broad-based programmes of human rights education , as well as the strengthening of local non-governmental organizations .  
When barriers are erected against immigrants , or deep cuts are made in welfare budgets , or programmes intended to encourage the social integration of minorities are dismantled , all with complete sang _ froid and disdain for the human condition , and when the most basic rights to education and health denied to the children of immigrants , as Act No . 187 of the State of California in the United States would do , these practices are becoming institutionalized .  
The Government of Mexico , given the incidents in Riverside County , California , in March and April 1996 when Mexican nationals were beaten and some lost their lives , has expressed its indignation to its United States counterpart and forcefully condemned violations of its nationals ' human rights , stating that the clear abuse of authority displayed in those incidents confirms the urgent need for determined action to stamp out discriminatory attitudes which spill over into acts of institutional violence .  
After reviewing the testimony and documentation we are convinced that the evidence supports a conclusion that police violence and corruption on the local , state and federal levels , particularly within communities of colour and poor communities , are at the foundation of a gross and consistent pattern of human rights violations in the United States .  
A number of Governments have taken action to provide basic health services for youth ; promote good sanitation and hygiene practices among youth ; develop health education and accessible , available and affordable primary health care services ( including services related to sexual and reproductive health and relevant education in those fields , such as information about sexually transmitted diseases , such as human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) ) ; eliminate sexual abuse of young people ; and combat malnutrition among young people .  
While rapid economic growth based largely on investment in human resources has facilitated a reduction of the proportion of the poor in some parts of the ESCAP region , inadequate investment in human resources has sustained and in some cases actually increased the concentration of the poor in other parts of the region . 
The aims and objectives of the national youth policy of Indonesia are : ( a ) to help foster Indonesia awareness , identity , solidarity and prosperity among youth ; ( b ) to promote policies and programmes relating to youth as an integral part of social and cultural values among the Asian and Pacific nations ; and ( c ) to realize the potential of youth as human resources in regional development .  
Generally , small island developing States face inordinate operational difficulties because of inadequate technically qualified human resources , poor infrastructure and installation , and deficient planning .  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
This is due to the number and complexity of the polluting materials being discharged into receiving waters , inadequate knowledge about the pathways and ultimate sinks of many pollutants , the need for expensive and sophisticated analytical procedures for some pollutants , and insufficient knowledge of the human and environmental impacts of many pollutants , particularly synthetic organic materials .  
The challenge today remains the same : to meet an enormous projected global demand for resources , especially energy , through the use of new products , technologies and consumption patterns which will provide rising standards of living for all while minimizing economic costs and risks to human health and the environment .  
Evidence is strong that most of the increase is attributable to human activity , in particular , to fossil fuel combustion . 8 Continuation of these emission trends poses serious , though uncertain , risks of global and regional climate change , leading to unpredictable rises in sea level , inundation of low-lying coastal areas , migration of ecosystems and disruption of agriculture .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of HCHR / CHR , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , HCHR / CHR has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
The series fills a real gap in the human rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 163 of 21 December 1993 in which it proclaimed the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People ( 1995-2004 ) , stated that the Decade 's main objective was to strengthen international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights , the environment , development , education and health .  
An effective response requires the implementation of all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , and fundamental freedoms of all people , in accordance with existing international human rights standards ;  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .  
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .  
Constraints include : ( a ) scarcity of human and financial resources ; ( b ) low institutional capacity ; ( c ) lack of coherent realistic policies in some countries , and on occasions lack of political will ; and ( d ) inadequate awareness and understanding of the potential benefits and risks of the technology , as well as of the requirements for its environmentally sound management .  
Paragraph 238 explains that , in the provision of assistance , facilitating mechanisms are to be supported for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of human settlements progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
It is important to note that the Habitat II Conference reconfirmed the legal status of the human right to adequate housing as set forth in the relevant international instruments and stressed that this right should be progressively , but fully , realized .  
We reaffirm that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social - are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
In its resolution 1996 / 64 of 23 April 1996 entitled " Regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Asian and Pacific region " , the Commission on Human Rights reaffirmed that regional arrangements played a fundamental role in promoting and protecting human rights and that they should reinforce universal human rights standards , as contained in international human rights instruments .  
The Amman Workshop reaffirms that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu .  
The Workshop calls upon States to refrain from any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in international human rights instruments , in particular the rights of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their health and well _ being , including food and medical care , housing and the necessary social services .  
The Workshop strongly recommends that a regional technical cooperation programme be designed and implemented as a matter of urgent priority in partnership with the Centre for Human Rights of the United Nations , under its technical cooperation programme , with a view to facilitating the sharing of experience , expertise and best practices within the region to further enhance national and regional human rights capacities .  
Actions taken in furtherance of the present Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States , as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
A report by three VSV human rights workers arbitrarily imprisoned in October in a SARM cachot in Kinshasa ( see para . 104 ) is revealing as to the treatment of the inmates there : inhuman and cruel conditions ; constant ill _ treatment , to the point of slavery ; overcrowded cells ( up to 19 inmates ) ; lack of beds ; access to the toilets depending on the warders ' mood ; mental , though not systematically physical torture . 
While maintaining her call for continued economic assistance to the countries in her mandate for their reconstruction , the Special Rapporteur believes that local authorities must be kept aware that such assistance ( to be distinguished from emergency humanitarian aid ) depends expressly on their demonstrated respect for the principles of international human rights .  
The report will highlight important findings announced at the London meeting , in particular , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominantly cereal diets of most developing countries .  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
The ongoing programmes are essential and deeply appreciated .  The conduct of the forthcoming elections and other challenges outlined in this report will make the coming couple of years crucial in the efforts to build a society in Cambodia that respects all the human rights of all the people .  
Such issues included : human adaptation to alpine conditions , the general pathology and the curative properties of the mountain climate , distinctive features of the social environment and mentality of mountain peoples , and economic development and demographic stability in mountain regions .  
The international community 's attention to this global problem , and the coordination and adoption of an appropriate programme of collective preventive measures , would do much to neutralize or reduce the negative impact of mountain - climate cataclysms on human lives , and would promote the sustainable economic development of mountainous countries and mountain peoples .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
All Sudanese citizens living in areas controlled by the Government of the Sudan are potential victims of human rights violations and abuses , regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic origin or social status , once they are considered to be opponents of the Government of the Sudan , or even suspected of being in disagreement with its political agenda .  
At the very minimum , the mandate requires the services of two regular human rights officers , adequate administrative support , and a commensurate level of secretarial expertise .  
The continued existence of the problem of internal displacement combined with the ongoing need to search for solutions require that the capacity of the Representatives mandate and of the United Nations human rights machinery in general be strengthened in order to meet these challenges in a comprehensive and effective manner .  
If applicable , assists the Director in preparing methods and procedures for verification of human rights during internal armed confrontation , commitment to strengthening the system for the protection of human rights , commitment relating to security forces and the bearing of arms , military conscription and voluntary nature and behaviour of paramilitary forces ; assists also in following up the verification and evaluating the findings of regional offices . 
In its resolution , the Commission urged the international community to give the necessary support to developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments governing the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all .  
The Commission requested the Secretary-General to establish in the Centre for Human Rights a focal unit with the specific task of following up on the findings of the Special Rapporteur and other issues related to the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity and be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Declaration , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its decision 1996 / 112 of 23 April 1996 , decided to retain on its agenda item 10 ( a ) entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , it being understood that action required by previous resolutions of the Commission on that subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary-General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
As it relates to freedom of expression , the Kurdish question consists of a positive element _ cultural identity as an essential part of the universal human dignity protected by human rights _ and a negative element _ the political usurpation of this identity by those who seek to gain and retain power by all means , including terrorism .  
An express and clear incitement to hatred or to the use of violence that poses a clear and imminent danger to the legitimate interests of the State and all of its citizens calls for the State to take strong action to protect all human rights as well as national security and public order , bearing in mind the necessity and proportionality of those measures in relation to the threat posed .  
The Government faces a very difficult task and heavy responsibility in its obligation to protect all citizens of the Turkish Republic from the scourge of terrorism while simultaneously protecting all human rights of all the people of Turkey . 55 .  Secondly , while the press and other media are vivid , the Special Rapporteur finds that , at times , the press is not inspired by a vision of itself as a professional force that serves to inform all members of the public .  
The joint scientific research programme conducted during the 21st expedition included experiments relating to the vital functions of the human organism , microgravity , basic biological research , advanced technologies and Earth sciences .  
These experiments are aimed at laying the practical foundations for enabling human beings to spend prolonged periods of time under conditions of space flight ( studies on radiation safety , strain on the human support and locomotive system , determination of the mechanisms involved in vestibular disorders and changes in the cardiovascular system , and development of methods for their prevention or treatment ) .  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Requests the International Civil Service Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the United Nations common system , including consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session . 
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
Attention was drawn to the frequent emphasis placed by international forums on the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights , be they civil , political , economic , social or cultural .  
The adoption of a protocol in respect of an instrument that contained civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural human rights , would constitute an important step towards the actual realization of that principle .  
Past experience , together with results from expert group meetings and the interactive dialogues to be held during the Commission in 1997 , may serve as a basis for identifying measures which could help to accelerate progress in achieving equality between men and women in the critical areas of concern identified at Beijing as crucial for eliminating discrimination against women and enabling women around the world to fully enjoy their human rights .  
The objective will be to develop an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the implementation , coordination and promotion of the right to development in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , aimed at facilitating action to be taken by relevant bodies of the United Nations system , including human rights treaty bodies , and international development and financial institutions and non _ governmental organizations . 
He is referring to the interrelationship between three problems : growing unemployment , which affects the poorest sectors and might lead to dangerous marginalization ; urban crime , which has very high rates and is prejudicial to substantive human rights such as the right to life and the right to physical integrity ; and security , which involves serious defects and alarming contrasts .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
The degree of enjoyment of both civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights has altered significantly among the various segments of the Afghan population ; gender and ethnic origin have become important determining factors regarding the degree of enjoyment of human rights in certain parts of the country .  
In East Timor , a wide range of human rights violations continued to take place during the last year , compounded by increasing incidents of political , religious and ethnic violence .  
The present report limits itself to a selection of human activities that are : ( a ) not gravely hazardous to the environment if carried out over a limited period of time but are cumulative and hazardous if undertaken on a continued basis ; ( b ) undertaken occasionally and / or involve a potential risk of major contamination within a given geographical area and time-frame .  4 .  The report , however , does not provide a comprehensive analysis of environmental impacts of activities that are gravely hazardous to the environment .  
Although the Commission was not yet fully functional at the time of the mission of the Special Rapporteur , standing committees had been established on relations with non _ governmental and community _ based organizations , and international and parliamentary liaison , on legal and constitutional matters , and on policy and planning matters , including those relating to women 's human rights .  
Working together , the human rights community will make the United Nations human rights programme a programme of all people everywhere : strong , to prevent human rights violations ; reliable , to protect and defend victims ; interactive , to be shaped by all the actors concerned ; flexible , to react to evolving needs ; compelling , to build a worldwide Partnership for Human Rights .  
The criteria for sustainable development should include better protection of all human rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as protection of the most vulnerable and impoverished .  
The holistic approach to human rights requires , however , that particular attention be paid to the areas of human rights which are currently in a weaker position : from a global perspective , economic , social and cultural rights require further attention in determining their contents and strengthening the means and methods of their realization . 
Whether expressed in terms of State responsibility or of international human rights , development requires competent governmental leadership , coherent national policy , and strong popular commitment .  
The experience of countries which have chosen the challenging road to sustainable development , democracy and human rights , and which are already beginning to enjoy the fruits of this decision in the form of interrelated economic progress , political consolidation and social stability , proves that human rights are not only noble ideas .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
The international community must act with energy to eradicate gross violations of human rights and humanitarian crises , which are major human tragedies and result in millions of refugees and internally displaced persons , starving children and adults , lack of medical care , and hopeless futures for thousands lost and sometimes forgotten in even the most developed countries .  
On the basis of a comprehensive review of the activities of the Programme , the High Commissioner has developed the following policy orientation : the Programme focuses on countries in transition to democracy and less developed countries ; priority consideration is given to programmes addressing mandates emanating from the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action and from resolutions of United Nations organs , such as strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights , the promotion of economic , social and cultural rights , developing national plans of action , and building national institutions .  
Most representatives agreed with the Commission 's proposed approach to separate consideration of the question of the nationality of natural persons from that of the nationality of legal persons and to give priority to the former , which , it was argued , involved human rights , while the latter raised problems of an economic order .  
It was observed that the Declaration of the Venice Commission contained detailed provisions on the right of option and also included a new rule which , however , was in conformity with international standards of human rights , providing that the exercise of the right of option must have no prejudicial consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their right to residence in the successor State and their movable or immovable property located therein .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Other important factors determining possible programmes of technical cooperation that HC / CHR provides to Member States at their request are : specific recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies ; recommendations by the Commission on Human Rights and its mechanisms , including the representatives of the Secretary-General , the special rapporteurs on thematic or country situations and the various working groups ; the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation ; and the views expressed by national human rights institutions and national and international NGOs .  
The assessment team meets with interested parties , both governmental and non-governmental , in close cooperation with the United Nations Resident Coordinator , United Nations agencies and programmes , as well as local donors , and compiles detailed information on current policies , legislation , and human and financial capacities in key areas .  
In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .

Recalling the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annexed to General Assembly resolution 49 / 60 of 9 December 1994 , in which the Assembly declared that acts , methods and practices of terrorism constituted a grave violation of the purpose and principles of the United Nations , and might pose a threat to international peace and security , jeopardize friendly relations among States , hinder international cooperation and aim at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic bodies of society ,

In other words , the principle of holding States accountable for non-compliance with their treaty obligations by means of an objective and constructive dialogue , on the basis of comprehensive information and inputs from all interested parties , has been vindicated in practice and has the potential to be an important and effective means by which to promote respect for human rights .  
It has been suggested in a number of places in this report that the provision of advisory services , or technical cooperation in the field of human rights , has a vital role to play in relation to those States which do not have the administrative capacity , technical expertise or financial resources required to prepare the reports they are legally obligated to provide under the relevant treaties .  
One of 20 substantive themes identified for the advisory services programme is treaty reporting and international obligations ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 90 , para . 23 ) , but the independent expert has not been able to identify from the available documentation any case in which assistance has been provided specifically for either the undertaking of a survey of the necessary measures to be taken prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or the preparation of a report to a treaty body .  
Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Emphasizing the priority that attaches to implementing specific measures to establish mechanisms that will facilitate the attainment of the practical objectives of building a democratic State ruled by law , based on political pluralism , the market economy , supremacy of the law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ,

Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Mindful that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights ,  
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient atttention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,

Reaffirms that the provision of advisory services and technical cooperation may be seen as a complement to the monitoring activities of the human rights programme from which no Government is exempt , and notes in this regard that , in order to produce lasting results , monitoring and preventive activities may need to be accompanied by promotional activities through advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirms that advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights require close cooperation and coordination between United Nations bodies and specialized agencies active in this field so as to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their respective programmes and avoid unnecessary duplication , and requests the High Commissioner to explore yet further possibilities for cooperation with specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as non _ governmental organizations ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;

Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Concerned that implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the Beijing Platform for Action remains far from the objectives set forth in the two documents and , therefore , calls once again for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status and human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms ;  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,

Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Apart from international humanitarian law , Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , whose wording is repeated in the preamble to the draft optional protocol , stipulates : For the purposes of the present Convention , a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier .  
The international community will in future have to supply technological , economic and financial assistance to support political stability and balanced development , democratic institution-building and respect for human rights .  
Reaffirming its objectives as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
In paragraph 17 of his statement , the Secretary-General proposes to head the five verification areas ( human rights ; indigenous affairs ; social , economic and agrarian aspects ; strengthening of civilian power ; and resettlement and integration ) at the D-1 level instead of the current P-5 level .  
Noting that El Ni �� has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
Calls upon both the landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , including bilateral cooperation , to implement measures to strengthen further their cooperative and collaborative efforts in dealing with transit issues , inter alia , by improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral and subregional agreements to govern transit transport operations , developing joint ventures in the area of transit transport , and strengthening institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport , and , in this respect , notes that South-South cooperation also plays an important role in this field ;  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
Cuba 's bilateral relationship with Canada had enabled the Cuban delegation to communicate to that countrys representatives the point of view of vast sectors of civil society in Cuba regarding the exercise of human rights by the indigenous population of Canada , particularly their economic , social and cultural rights , in respect of which much progress needed to be made .  
The underlying reason for submitting the draft resolution was the fact that the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in an increasing number of developing countries had reached alarming proportions and had had adverse economic , social and cultural effects .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief detailed egregious violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief and demonstrated the degree to which that most fundamental human right continued to be breached .  
The solution to the problem of terrorism lay in addressing its root causes , as reaffirmed in any number of General Assembly resolutions , such as 40 / 61 and 46 / 51 , which urged States to pay special attention to situations involving flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and those involving alien domination and foreign occupation , that might give rise to international terrorism .  
The members of the Subcommittee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .  
Loss of experienced personnel and skilled labour , declines in productivity , the need for increased resources to hire and retrain replacements , increased absenteeism and labour turnover , increased health-care costs , coupled with the human and social costs endured by the individuals and communities affected by the pandemic are imposing heavy burdens , particularly on developing countries with limited resources .  
Convinced that small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of global climate change and sea level rise , and that tropical storms , the El Ni �� phenomenon and drought have resulted in the inundation of some islands and have caused serious loss of resources in their exclusive economic zones , economic infrastructure , human settlements and culture ,  
Stresses also in this context the need for various measures by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , especially the least developed countries , for their full integration into the world economy ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote [ sustained economic growth and sustainable development ] ,  
The major tasks of UNTAES were to assist in the demilitarization of the region ; to facilitate , together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the voluntary and safe return of refugees and displaced persons ; to reintegrate civil administration and public services ; to establish a temporary police force ; to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ; to organize elections ; to monitor respect for the highest standards of human rights ; and to promote an atmosphere of confidence among all local residents .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all Member States and seek their views and information on the implications and negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their populations , and to submit accordingly a report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session ; 8 .  Decides to examine this question , on a priority basis , at its fifty-third session under the sub-item entitled " Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " .  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
The delegation of Cyprus had given an accurate and alarming picture of the situation prevailing in the Turkish occupied area of northern Cyprus , where the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Greek Cypriot population were being systematically violated , as they had been throughout the 23-year presence of the Turkish armed forces on the island .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in support of national efforts in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Reaffirms that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty , to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty , and to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
The Ministry of the Interior had established a department whose responsibilities included the programme of reparation for acts committed between 1976 and 1983 , while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instituted a department with responsibility for shaping foreign policy in the area of human rights and the advancement of women and for coordinating with international bodies in that field . 
Mr . Al-Humaimidi ( Iraq ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the comments made by the United States representative following the introduction of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq had been motivated by that countrys desire to prevent the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq , despite Iraqs full compliance with the relevant Security Council resolution and contrary to the views of most members of the international community . 
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Terrorism had been clearly and definitively rejected by the international community because it violated the most basic of human rights , the right to life ; because it mutilated , tortured and violated human minds and bodies ; and because , with its underlying morbid and fascist philosophy , it aimed to paralyse social , political and cultural life and to obstruct the normal exercise of rights and freedoms .  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 , stressed the importance of the right to development as a universal and inalienable human right which should be treated by the international community , alongside other fundamental rights , globally in a fair and equal manner . 
In 1996 , a number of African countries encountered special development situations with the collapse of public and social services , disruption of economic activities , insecurity and armed conflict , the breakdown of law and order , massive population displacement and widespread human suffering .  
Takes note of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ;  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,  
Welcoming the fact that the call of the World Conference on Human Rights for a United Nations system _ wide approach to human rights issues has been reflected in the recommendations of major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ,  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient attention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,

Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Protocols thereto in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , and other pertinent international instruments ;  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Decides to consider the question of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions as a matter of priority at its fifty _ fourth session under the item entitled Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Takes into account the Bangkok Declaration wherein it is recognized that while human rights are universal in nature , they must be considered in the context of a dynamic and evolving process of international norm _ setting , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Reaffirms that the provision of advisory services and technical cooperation does not exempt any country from the monitoring activities of the human rights programme , and notes in this regard that , in order to produce lasting results , monitoring and preventive activities may need to be accompanied by promotional activities through advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirms that advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights require close cooperation and coordination between United Nations bodies and specialized agencies active in this field so as to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their respective programmes and avoid unnecessary duplication , and requests the High Commissioner to explore yet further possibilities for cooperation with specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as non _ governmental organizations ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
Furthermore , my Office 's overall efforts towards the economic reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina , functioning common institutions and the improvement of the overall human rights , policing and judicial situation can be expected to have beneficial effects for the provision of durable solutions for displaced persons and returning refugees .  
Considerable efforts have been made everywhere in Africa to revitalize the social sector , minimize needless waste of human and natural resources , promote popular participation and democratic governance , focus world attention on the continent 's needs for a more supportive international economic environment , and reinforce efforts at conflict prevention and resolution .  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
The Commission expects that the activities of the new human rights office in Bogot will contribute to improving the human rights situation in Colombia and to promoting a climate of trust between the Government and all sectors involved in the conflict , encouraging a process of constructive dialogue involving non _ governmental organizations and other sectors of civil society , and to preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Protocols thereto in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , and other pertinent international instruments ;  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Decides to consider the question of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions as a matter of priority at its fifty _ fourth session under the item entitled Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories . 
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms into conformity with international law and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment as well as harassment of and threats against human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to the prisons by non _ governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,  
Welcoming the fact that the call of the World Conference on Human Rights for a United Nations system _ wide approach to human rights issues has been reflected in the recommendations of major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ,  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , to retain on its agenda item 10 ( a ) , entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , and to give it due priority at its fifty _ fourth session , it being understood that action required by previous resolutions of the Commission on the subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary _ General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
A sound peace agreement which is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human , political and economic rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
In this connection , it is worth noting that during the fifteenth session of the Commission on Human Settlements , some delegations expressed their concern over the tendency of the Centre to spread its resources on activities that were largely tangential to its mandate and expressed the hope that the programme of work would remain focused on human settlements development as its prime objective .  
Indeed there is little evidence that Habitat has an institutional memory in the sense that it is capable either of presenting in a succinct form the essential lessons of working in the field of human settlements over the last 25 years , or that it would be possible to construct a computerized expert system based on the knowledge recorded and available within Habitat that could respond to basic randomly generated questions in this area .  
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
The European Union welcomes the formal undertaking by the Belarus authorities to initiate consultations with all the deputies of the elected thirteenth Supreme Soviet to establish a proper balance between the functions and duties of the members of the legislative , executive and judicial powers , as well as devise mechanisms that would strengthen respect for human rights and the position of the independent media .  
The arrangements agreed stress cooperation and coordination , and are rooted in recognition by all those involved of the need to achieve and maintain a streamlined process , avoiding duplication of effort and promoting efficiency and cost-effective use of human and financial resources while ensuring provision of the necessary information to the various fora charged with monitoring the actions of governments , their partners in civil society and those of international institutions , working in a coordinated manner to achieve the Summit objectives .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
The objectives will be met by providing support to the mechanisms for humanitarian coordination , emergency response and inter-agency collaboration at Headquarters and in the field through the Emergency Relief Coordinator , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the United Nations humanitarian or resident coordinators in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of people suffering from famine , displacement and human deprivation as a result of civil strife or other conflict-driven situations .  
To that end , the focus of the subprogramme will be on the role of the Organization in furthering economic and social development , democracy and human rights and peace and security , and enhancing the image of the United Nations as an efficient and effective organization capable of meeting the challenges posed in a rapidly changing international environment .  
In the resolution concerning the question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and study of special problems which the developing countries faced in their efforts to achieve those human rights , the Commission called upon States to secure , through national development policies and international cooperation , full respect for economic , social and cultural rights , giving priority to individuals , most often women , living in extreme poverty .  
In resolution 1997 / 33 , on the protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , States were urged , in collaboration and through the community , to promote a supportive and enabling environment for women , children and other vulnerable groups , by addressing underlying prejudices and inequalities through community dialogue , specially designed social and health services , and support community groups .  
Following a short discussion , the Sub-Commission , in resolution 1993 / 30 , expressed its appreciation to Mr . Chernichenko for that working paper and decided to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights his appointment as Special Rapporteur to prepare a report entitled Recognition of gross and large _ scale violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of Governments or sanctioned by them as an international crime .  
Gross and massive violations of human rights can be committed by local State bodies and officials , too , but the danger of such violations increases immeasurably when they are committed by , for example , a parliament passing racist laws , or a ministerial cabinet conducting a repressive policy .  
On the subject of human rights violations committed on the orders or with the sanction of Governments , it must be borne in mind that the term Government in this context is used not in the narrow sense , to designate the highest executive organ ( the council of ministers , cabinet or suchlike ) , but the entire system of State bodies , particularly legislative and executive , and the associated officials , since it is they who are most often the instigators when violations of human rights occur .  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of a Government or with its sanction to be international crimes will establish a firm basis in international law for addressing , first , the grave international legal responsibility of the State on behalf of which a Government acts and , second , the question of the criminal responsibility of officials perpetrating such violations .  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights ordered or sanctioned by a Government to be international crimes could to some extent help to prevent gross and massive violations of human rights by acting as a warning to Governments and public officials .  
The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
The responsibility of individuals , acting on behalf of a State and participating in the perpetration , by that State , of gross and massive violations of human rights constituting an international crime can be realized on the basis of the laws of the State which was injured as a result of the crime , on the basis of the laws of the State on behalf of which the individuals in question acted , or in accordance with an international agreement .  
In addition , the declaration must without fail refer to the inseparable link between the responsibility of the State that the perpetrated gross and massive violations of human rights which can be classified as international crimes and the individual responsibility of persons participating in their perpetration .  
Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted on 25 June 1993 , expressed grave concern about continuing human rights violations in all parts of the world in disregard of standards contained in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law and about the lack of sufficient and effective remedies for the victims ,  
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .  
Ten workshops : two annual regional workshops in Asia and the Pacific , for government representatives to discuss human rights issues that require a regional approach and initiatives , such as the establishment of regional arrangements for the protection and promotion of human rights ; two regional training courses in Africa and Asia on economic , social and cultural rights ; two specialized regional training courses in Latin America and Africa for trainers ; and two national training courses for lawyers and judges ; ( iii ) Fellowships .  
UNDP assistance under the fifth cycle country programme ( 1992-1996 ) to the Caribbean dependent Territories which includes the Turks and Caicos Islands , had as its principal focus the provision of support for human resource development , capacity-building , institutional strengthening and environment and natural resources management .  With this in view , the proposed strategy of UNDP at the start of the current sixth cycle has been to continue its emphasis on providing support in those areas , building upon the outputs of its previous interventions .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
There will be particular emphasis on strengthened planning and recruitment systems and methods , taking full account of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and gender balance ; staff learning , training and career development ; managed staff reassignment programmes ; established managerial competencies ; support to organizational and managerial reform ; improved work environment and managerial practices ; and better technical human resources management services and support to departments and offices .  
First and foremost , reinforcing peaceful conditions , a stable political framework , full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and effective participation by civil society are indispensable foundations for sustainable development .  
A more equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of risks require careful management of public policies and coordination of national and global policies dealing with markets , as well as stronger international support for infrastructure and human resources development in developing countries .  
In paragraphs 45 to 47 of my report of 7 February 1997 ( S / 1997 / 115 ) , I described in detail the challenges that would be faced by the administrative component of the follow-on mission , as logistical support would have to be provided to headquarters of the follow-on mission in Luanda , to the political , police , human rights and military components in six regional headquarters , and to almost all provincial capitals and over 30 other outstations .  
The High Contracting Parties shall base their relations with each other on the principles of mutual respect , sovereign equality , territorial integrity , the inviolability of borders , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of pressure , the right of peoples to control their own destiny , non-interference in internal affairs , observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , cooperation among States , and conscientious fulfilment of international obligations and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
The Presidents stressed the need for unconditional respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the preservation and development , in accordance with universally recognized norms , of the ethnic , linguistic , cultural and religious diversity of all peoples living in the Russian Federation and Ukraine .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
Moreover , the major donors stated in 1995 that the role of external partners is to help strengthen capacities in developing partner countries , and that the dominant conception of the mission of development assistance is to help countries and societies to strengthen their economic , human , social and institutional capacities for self-sustaining development .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on the respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
Particular emphasis should be given to the cooperative and collaborative efforts of the landlocked and transit developing countries in dealing with the transit problems , inter alia , through improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral agreements to govern transit transport operations ; development of joint ventures in the area of transit transport ; and strengthening of institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
In order to ensure democracy and human rights for all Afghan men and women , irrespective of religious , racial , ethnic and / or linguistic differences , based upon the recognized principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other related internationally accepted covenants in line with the tenets of Islamic Law ,  
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
United Nations agencies should encourage small States to adopt regional approaches , wherever advantageous , with relevant assistance justified in cost-benefit terms and focused on human resources development , environmental activities and reducing the administrative constraints imposed by small size .  
The Committee recommended the establishment of specific machinery located at the highest policy level , with adequate financial and human resources , that would coordinate and guide action in favour of women , would be able to prevent the persistence of attitudes , prejudices and stereotypes that discriminate against women and would narrow the gap between de jure and de facto equality .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
The main objective of the round table , following-up on the interregional round table held in Toronto , Canada , in September 1996 , was to monitor the manner in which ethical medical directives protected human rights .  
The participants agreed that , taken overall , these conferences and the Convention provided a basis on which to build not only the right of women to health but also the enjoyment of good health as a human right and that they exposed the extent of the poverty and economic dependence of women , the limited power exercised by many women over their sexual and reproductive life and their lack of influence over decisions , all of which social factors have a negative effect on their health .  
Since countries differed in terms of their living conditions , level of development , geographic characteristics and cultural traditions , there could be no uniform standard or model for solving the problems related to human settlements .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
The enormous challenges facing the housing sector and human settlements at the global level required new and more efficient modalities of international cooperation , including the dissemination of the " best practices " , as well as the political will of States to adopt appropriate measures in that area .  
In addition , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 47 / 180 , they had prepared national reports , established national committees with broad-based participation and made specific proposals and firm commitments regarding housing and human settlements at the national and international levels .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
Our overriding and ultimate concern is to ensure a clean and safe planet that is hospitable and friendly to human life , now and in the future .  
It is also understood that global sustainability will remain mere wishful thinking so long as the rich industrialized countries continue to undermine the ecological life-support system of the human family by wasting resources .  
The preamble common to the two International Covenants on Human Rights recognizes that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights . 
The 1968 Proclamation of Tehran reaffirmed that human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible ; in the context of that interdependence , the realization of economic , social and cultural rights is of crucial importance for the effective exercise of civil and political rights .  
Article 1 , paragraph 3 , stipulates that one of the Purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
It was erected into a system of government and applied for about a century accompanied by violations of human rights , both economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights .  
The right to a healthy environment has been violated as a result of human activities which increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , with all the consequent effects on global warming , rising sea levels and climate in general .  
While producing their own negative effects on the enjoyment of human rights in general and economic , social and cultural rights in particular , these phenomena have multiplier effects which also exacerbate the increasingly serious and numerous problems faced by the populations of poor regions .  
When genetic variations are lost , therefore , the result is not only that specific and potential properties and adaptations are lost but also that the number of species is diminished , ecosystems are impaired and the ability to sustain human life is damaged .  
Any transaction for the transfer of wastes is a serious violation of the right to a healthy environment and , quite obviously , of the whole set of human rights , whether individual or collective , economic , social and cultural or civil and political .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , in its resolution 16 / 24 of 7 May 1997 entitled " Special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 " , reaffirmed that sustainable development was essential for human settlements development and expressed the conviction that urban settlements , properly planned and managed , held a promise for human development and for the protection of the world 's natural resources through their ability to support large numbers of people while limiting their negative impact on the natural environment .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; equal opportunity for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; equal opportunity for participation in public decision-making ; equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
It can not be overemphasized that discrimination between human beings on the grounds of race , colour or ethnic origin is an obstacle to friendly and peaceful relations among nations and is capable of disturbing peace and security among peoples as well as the harmony of people living side by side even within the same State .  
That the publishers and editors at this meeting believe in peaceful and creative understanding and tolerance and in the educational potential of the press as a means of transmitting values based on respect for the life and dignity of human beings and of encouraging cooperation for the consolidation of a culture of peace . 
Efforts should be made by the international community and intergovernmental bodies and organizations to establish cooperative relations with the authorities in Afghanistan in order to assist in the eradication of illicit cultivation , production and trafficking of narcotic drugs , especially in the drug-producing areas of the country , and to provide them with packages of aid and the means of economic reform , such as human development and capacity-building , mobilization of resources and industrial development to enable them to resort to alternative sources of income , which would provide better economic possibilities for future generations ;  
In contrast to the positions adopted by some human rights bodies which considered that once the reservation was deemed impermissible the reserving State continued to be bound by the treaty as a whole , he emphasized that the treaty was still a consensual instrument , drawing its strength from the will of States . 37 / The reservations made , he said , were consubstantial with the State 's consent to be bound by the treaty . 
The success of collective response to humanitarian crises depends not only on a well _ coordinated and integrated plan of action , but also on the availability of the human , material and financial resources necessary to ensure that timely assistance is provided .  
Injustice , political oppression , human rights abuses , social and economic inequalities , and the absence of democratic freedom and development opportunities are often part of a complex mix of underlying factors contributing to conflict . 
The consultations had provided an opportunity for agencies to present their activities and to discuss possible cooperation on , for example : joint input to the Commission on Human Rights , the Sub-Commission and the Working Group , the provision of relevant information to be included on a website page , joint minority-related technical cooperation projects , submission of information on system-wide complaints procedures , input into the treaty bodies , dissemination of the recommendations and resolutions of supervisory bodies , and the provision of training on minority-related human rights instruments at regional and national levels .  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of exerting pressure , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
I would like to refer to my announcement to the Security Council on 8 July 1997 that I intended to appoint an investigative team in order to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 , and to the briefing the Council received on the subject on 30 July .  
I have the honour to inform you that your letter dated 1 August 1997 ( S / 1997 / 617 ) concerning your decision to appoint Mr . Atsu-Koffi Amega ( Togo ) and Mr . Andrew R . Chigovera ( Zimbabwe ) to be respectively the Chairman and a member of the investigative team to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 has been brought to the attention of the members of the Council .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
Recalling also that , in its resolution 40 / 61 of 9 December 1985 , the General Assembly stated that it was mindful of the necessity of maintaining and safeguarding the basic rights of the individual in accordance with the relevant human rights instruments and generally accepted international standards ,  
There had been thinly veiled attempts at altering the demographic composition and physical characteristics of the occupied Palestinian territory , incessant human rights violations , plundering of the territory 's natural resources and exploitation of its labour force .  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining the multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
A sound peace agreement that is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human ( political and economic ) rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
Noting that the appointment of a special rapporteur had now become advisable , Ms . Palley drew the attention of the working group to five issues : the legality of privatization under international human rights law ; the extent of delegation of duties possible under privatization ; the question of whether United Nations standards must be further developed ; the minimum safeguards required ; the most appropriate human rights monitoring method for private prisons .  
Mr . Weissbrodt stated that Mr . Chernichenkos important work greatly assisted the groups understanding of relevant aspects of international law , particularly in defining gross and massive violations of human rights .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Decides to authorize the inclusion of this question in the preliminary document concerning a study in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , to be submitted to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the Purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Acknowledging that indigenous peoples in many countries have been deprived of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and that many of the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples are linked to the historical and continuing deprivation of ancestral rights over lands , territories and resources ,  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 46 / 122 of 17 December 1991 by which it established the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery to assist representatives of non _ governmental organizations to participate in the deliberations of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery by providing them with financial assistance and to extend through established channels of assistance , humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of contemporary forms of slavery ,  
Included in this latter group are the United Nations political and economic and social departments ( Department of Political Affairs , Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department for Economic and Social Affairs ) and the World Health Organization . The political departments of the United Nations Secretariat consider the Agency 's support for the rule of law , promotion of human rights , democratization , human capacity-building and electoral assistance as strong potential areas , particularly in respect of cooperation for peacekeeping and peace-building programmes . 
In addition to natural capital , physical or produced capital , and to the now widely accepted notion of human capital , social capital refers to the functioning of the various institutions that are critical to individual welfare and social integration .  
The Sub _ Commission recognizes the efforts of the Government of Guatemala and urges it to continue with its policy of implementing measures for the protection and promotion of both individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to continue to take practical measures against poverty and to eradicate extreme poverty in order to raise the living standards of the population ; and to redouble the efforts already instituted to overcome the marginalization and discrimination to which the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have been , and continue to be subjected .  
However , the increased international attention to , and importance of , transparency of transfers and possession of conventional arms are justified by the fact that these conventional arms cause serious human suffering in international and internal conflicts and are not subject to legal regimes in many parts of the world .  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development , as proclaimed by the General Assembly in resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , where stress is laid on the multidimensional , integrated and dynamic character of this right which promotes partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aimed at universal and effective observance of all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
Requests Governments , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations and the specialized agencies , actively to support local , national and international initiatives , including the development of human rights indicators , aimed at assessing and improving the housing and living conditions of women throughout the world , in full consultation with and with the full participation of women themselves , their representatives and community _ based non _ governmental organizations and other relevant groups ;  
Having considered the final report of Mr . Leandro Despouy on Protection of human rights during states of emergency and the tenth annual list of States which , since 1 January 1985 , have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 19 and Add . 1 ) ,  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Guided by the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations , particularly Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter , which stipulates that one of the Purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion ,  
In resolution 1997 / 15 , the Commission decided to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts to meet prior to the fifty-fourth session of the Commission with a mandate to : ( a ) gather all relevant information from Governments , non-governmental organizations and any other relevant sources on the obstacles existing to the effective and full protection of the human rights of migrants ; and ( b ) elaborate recommendations to strengthen the promotion , protection and implementation of the human rights of migrants .  
We recognize that poverty , unemployment and other obstacles to human development , such as civil strife and war , as well as crime and social injustices , render our States and societies vulnerable to transnational organized crime and corruption ; and we are , therefore , resolved to undertake and intensify all necessary steps and measures to address such problems , with the cooperation and support of the international community .  
It was also recommended that the indicative list of criminal activities contained in article 1 of the draft framework convention should be supplemented with the following crimes : trafficking in illegal migrants ; extortion ; kidnapping ; cattle-rustling ; export of toxic wastes ; illicit export of precious raw materials ; trafficking in protected species ; international fraud ; sexual exploitation of children ; trafficking in human organs ; and violation of intellectual property rights .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
The integration of women into the management of public affairs was therefore not only part of an economic policy strategy aimed at achieving integrated and sustainable development but was also consistent with a coherent and global perspective on human rights .  
The current setting is characterized by the need for ( i ) larger capital resources , ( ii ) sophisticated technology , including information technology which can improve management practices and assure instantaneous access to information , and ( iii ) human skills for access to global markets .  
Mineral resource development may provide a boost to developing economies otherwise poor in natural and human resources and allow rapid economic growth , provided that the problems of macro-economic stability associated with mineral dependence , in particular the influence of mineral revenues on the real exchange rate and the effect of mining wage rates on overall wage levels , can be mastered .  
In conclusion , since environmental concerns found expression in diametrically opposite ways depending on economic situations and the geographical location of the countries concerned , efforts by the international community would become effective only when there was an emphasis on the human dimension of the consequences of environmental changes , which should be fully reflected in the post-1997 phase of implementation of Agenda 21 . 
The notion of sustainable human settlements must therefore be integrated more systematically both at the national level and within the United Nations system ; a dialogue must be established between civil society and its representatives , and cooperation among local Governments that had to resolve similar problems and between the various levels of government must be strengthened .  
In addition to the exodus from the countryside and chaotic urbanization , problems common to all developing countries , Lebanon encountered other difficulties : the destruction of housing and infrastructure ; the collapse of economic and cultural institutions ; the displacement of more than 100,000 families ; an unbalanced geographical distribution of the population ; a rise in unemployment ; the devastation of arable land ; stagnation in industry , tourism and commerce ; frequent human rights violations ; a breakdown of social and moral values ; growing drug use ; and increasing juvenile crime . 
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
As a result of the major conferences held during the 1990s , the international community had adopted a development model that encompassed objectives in the areas of economic growth , social progress , environmental protection and respect for human rights , which the member countries of MERCOSUR and Bolivia and Chile had decided to make into reality .  
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .  
Even though participants in the Conference had included the main representatives of the public , private and community sectors involved in the development of human settlements , the appeal which had been made at the Conference could not bear fruit without assistance and cooperation at the national level and , in particular , without the solidarity and effective and timely delivery of international contributions .  
That consensus had found concrete expression in the declarations and programmes of action of the major United Nations conferences , the themes of which - economic growth , the environment , population , human rights , social development , the advancement of women and human settlements - now should be articulated in the agenda for development , a fundamental document which should guide development worldwide on the eve of the twenty-first century .  
Three basic principles were embodied in the agenda : the multidimensional nature of the development process , encompassing such elements as sustainable economic growth , social justice , good governance and respect for human rights , including equal rights for women ; the need for an integrated approach at both the national and the international level , while ensuring their concomitance ; and the responsibility of each agent of development , giving priority to national action .  
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
The highest aim in their common belief is the human dimension of this joint initiative , which , as a continuing process , through comprehensive cooperation , should provide rapid economic development and prosperity to the peoples of the region .  
In view of the continued conflict and human tragedy in Afghanistan and the stalemated efforts to involve all the parties concerned in constructive and viable political dialogue , on 29 July , I appointed Mr . Lakhdar Brahimi as my Special Envoy on a short mission to consult interested and relevant countries and parties , as well as the Organization of the Islamic Conference , and to present a comprehensive review of the United Nations peacemaking activities in Afghanistan . 
The United Nations and the League of Arab States expressed their concern over the continuing problem of landmines and other unexploded devices that are causing serious human suffering and which have negative social and economic effects on mine-infested countries over an extended period .  
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
Leaders thanked the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands for his presentation on the Forum theme of reform , human values and togetherness and discussed how reforms aimed at achieving sustainable development should go beyond conventional economic dimensions to embrace the essentially holistic nature of the process , and took cognizance of the need for Pacific cultural values and norms to be the basic premise and foundation of this process and the work of regional institutions .  
Beyond the human cost , debt had created serious obstacles to economic growth by absorbing up to one fifth of export earnings , exhausting their limited stocks of foreign exchange and undermining their ability to engage in international trade on more equitable terms .  
Having received no response to the request he made in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur reiterates the urgent request he made to the existing Government to provide , as promised earlier by Major Buyoya , the results of the investigation into allegations of the expulsion manu militari of 392 Burundian refugees in Rwanda to Cibitoke province , on 30 September 1996 , by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front , at a time when numerous violations of human rights were being reported in that region .  
It should be recalled that the alternative site given to the Jahalin is located on rocky and windy land 500 metres from the Jerusalem garbage dump and was declared by an Israeli environmental study to be unfit for human habitation .  
For module two , covering supply reduction , the main focus areas are : adoption of a balanced and integrated approach to drug control ; development activities aimed at structural factors ; coordinated subregional efforts based on similar legislation ; crop replacement efforts including promotion of sustainable agriculture ; reliable data for measuring opium poppy cultivation ; political support by Governments ; capacity-building and human resources development ; and collection of information on experiences in alternative development .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .  
In subsequent statements , particularly , those entitled " political development policies " of the executive branches , emphasis was again placed on respecting human dignity and integrity ; ensuring civil rights and freedom ; defending public trials and the right to a lawyer ; fostering an independent mass media ; and fostering the principles of pluralism and diversity .  
They facilitate the spread of an economic model based on the principles of a market economy , while mass advertising and the global media help shape human aspirations and perceptions of social values .  
The principle of the indivisibility of universally recognized civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights continues to be a key element of today 's system for the promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms .  
All human rights political , civil , social and economic are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
These unresolved conflicts undermine the political , economic and social fabric of the States concerned , bringing destruction and untold human suffering to the victims of war .  
Only an efficient universal organization can help us cope with the pressing challenges of globalization , economic and social development , environmental changes and the urgent need to protect and respect human rights .  
The United Nations must view all human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural as universal , indivisible , interdependent , interrelated and embedded in the trinity of democracy , development and human rights .  
Their ultimate sacrifice reminds us that human beings are capable of great altruism in the face of suffering and of calm when faced with the destructive passion of armed conflict , even at the risk of their own lives .  
The United States has certainly designed a blockade that , like a vile medieval garrotte , has managed with slow and pyrrhic success to bring about innumerable shortages to 11-million human beings and has greatly hampered the country 's normal development .  
This remains crucial for the economic development of small economies whose vulnerabilities are intensified by our limited access to markets , narrow resource base , small size , inadequate levels of human resource development and proneness to natural disasters .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
Direct consequences of this fighting are the continuing massive loss of human life , killing , refugee flows , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive economic destruction .  
We are distressed about this downward trend , characterized by the widespread loss of human life and a worsening pattern of grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
At both the national and international levels , institutions to promote and protect human rights economic and social , as well as civil and political have spread , and often have flourished .  
As the first comprehensive international proclamation of the basic rights of the individual , it established a common understanding of human rights for mankind .  
Recalling these words , spoken 50 years ago , reminds us that human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social are indivisible .  
Despite the progress achieved , the increasing tragedies and the escalation of massive and systematic violations are brutal reminders of the ease and frequency with which the noble ideal of defending human rights can be compromised .  
The promulgation of numerous international legal human rights instruments ; notable action taken against racism , racial discrimination , religious intolerance and torture ; and support for democratization : these are some of the noteworthy elements of that work .  
We shall continue our determined action to promote a national and global order based on justice and equity in which all human rights are preserved , promoted and protected in the true spirit of the Universal Declaration . The President took the Chair . 
For many Governments , human rights is often raised as a mere slogan , or is used as a political instrument to be applied against enemies , glossed over with friends and neglected where direct national interests warrant it . 
Cooperation at the international level is important in ensuring the promotion of all human rights , bearing in mind that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
In Eritrea , foreign nationals , whatever their origin , were treated justly , in accordance with the law and their human rights were respected ; there had not been a single incident involving ethnic or national minorities in the seven years since independence .  
The fighting is again causing enormous suffering for the Afghan people and adds to their misery , while human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law continue to be violated with impunity .  
This is a space devoid of the most basic human values ; a space in which children are slaughtered , raped and maimed ; a space in which children are exploited as soldiers ; a space in which children are starved and exposed to extreme brutality .  
The Internet had the alarming potential of creating and reinforcing an electronically disenfranchised underclass , which would prevent the improvement of racial equality in a growing range of human and social needs and transactions .  
Moreover , the rules generally applicable to reservations were sufficiently flexible and adaptable to be applied with equal authority in the case of human rights and other normative treaties and should not be revised .  
Transnational corporations now have greater freedom to set up in countries where , owing to political , economic or social constraints or a lack of human and financial resources , environmental legislation is rudimentary , non _ existent or poorly enforced .  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
Under common article 3 , rape has also been charged in isolated instances of rape and other instances of sexual assault and sexual mutilation as cruel treatment , an outrage upon human dignity and humiliating and degrading treatment .  
The explicit linking of water issues to human development and economic productivity is generally lacking both in terms of national policy declarations and supporting legislative and administrative support .  
With water a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , the imperative remains to manage all freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality within minimum acceptable standards .  
The independent expert considered that the advisory services programme had not provided sufficient support for surveys required prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or for the preparation of reports by States in need of assistance .  
Committed to the full development of human potential within just and inclusive societies attentive to the promotion of harmonious and equitable relations among individuals belonging to diverse ethnic and religious groups ;  
With water as a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , there is an imperative need to manage land and freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality to minimum acceptable standards .  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area since small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
Stressing the fact that realization of the full range of human rights requires effective policies and compliance at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative to an effective anti-drugs strategy .  
A strong programme of advisory services and technical cooperation was identified by the World Conference as a major contribution to building national capacities and thus improving respect for human rights .  
Aass ( Norway ) said that the establishment of an international criminal court would be instrumental in providing a judicial response in cases where gross violations of human rights occurred and national jurisdictions proved inadequate .  
These include the universal , indivisible , and interdependent and interrelated nature of human rights , which must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis .  
Central to the right to development is the realization that all human rights are interdependent and indivisible and that durable economic and social progress requires respect for civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights .  
These are activities which can clearly signal a commitment to address human rights issues and to build a society in which all can live freely and to provide a solid legal framework for economic development which will aid national and international investment .  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Emphasizes that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that , as such , the international community must treat them globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ;  
Noting that El Nino has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area because small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
However , the unique demographic , economic and geographic constraints faced by small island developing States call for a strengthening of the concerted efforts at human resource development .  
The challenge now is to combine this complex policy and organizational mix at the local , national and international levels into a critical mass that can lead to significant changes in human behaviour .  
The human rights treaty system , established under the six operative international human rights treaties , consists of a voluntary system of self-monitoring by way of reporting , supervised by six independent and expert international committees .  
Growth was still constrained by a number of factors common to many LDCs , including poor physical and institutional infrastructure , aggravated by the landlocked nature of his country , low levels of human resource development and a high incidence of poverty .  
The CRC has reaffirmed the indivisible and interrelated nature of all human rights and fundamental freedoms addressing the civil , political , and economic , social and cultural rights of children .  
The Principles also provide that persons alleged to have committed these grave human rights violations should be suspended from any official duties during the investigation and removed from any position of control or power , whether direct or indirect .  
All human rights are universal , and States are obliged to respect those rights , regardless of whether they are of an economic , social , cultural , civil or political character .  
It also included a compilation of the views of Committee members on the report of the independent expert on the functioning of the human rights treaty bodies and addressed issues raised at the eighth meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies .  
While human rights education was not an obligatory part of the national curriculum , the concept of the equal worth of human beings was among the basic values taught at the primary school level .  
Recognizing that human rights were universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , the international community as a whole should strive towards a fair and equitable promotion and implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative for an effective anti-drugs strategy .  
That the realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and particularly economic , social and cultural rights , is a dynamic process and that , as is evident in today 's world , a great deal remains to be accomplished ;  
That the realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and particularly economic , social and cultural rights , is a dynamic process and that , as is evident in today 's world , a great deal remains to be accomplished ;

The meeting concluded that a comprehensive report examining the adequacy of observational networks , identifying the existing gaps and quantifying the financial and human resources required , should be prepared for the ninth session of the SBSTA .  
Such an approach , based on arbitrary , biased positions and inaccurate conclusions is not acceptable , nor does it serve for the protection and promotion of human rights , reflecting instead partial political interests .  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to facilitate a broad public debate on how a national human rights commission can be made an independent and effective institution , established by law and based on recognized international norms ;  
Believing that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,

Encourages the Government of Rwanda to facilitate a broad public debate on how a national human rights commission can be made an independent and effective institution , established by law and based on recognized international norms ;  
The report should have contained a functional analysis of the backstopping requirements of peacekeeping operations as they relate to the implementation of their mandates ( military , civilian police , human rights monitoring , humanitarian , electoral assistance ) .  
The Turkish Cypriot people have formed a democratic and secular State , with a plural system based on free elections , social justice and the rule of law , with its citizens enjoying all human rights and liberties .  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
Increased efforts of the Catholic Church and others , along with better understanding of the international humanitarian norms among senior military officers , improved the overall quality of human rights monitoring in East Timor .  
Components of the United Nations system should address , within their respective mandates , major obstacles to the implementation of all human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as well as serious violations of those rights .

During the war of liberation ( 1996-1997 ) , which was intended to put an end to the Mobutu dictatorship by restoring to the Congolese people its long-affronted dignity and establishing a State governed by the rule of law and respectful of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the Alliance des Forces Dmocratiques pour la Libration du Congo ( ADFL ) had accepted military and logistical assistance from several friendly countries , including Rwanda and Uganda .  
The table appended to this document is only a snapshot , giving no more than an indication , albeit a revealing one , of the blatant , deliberate and massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Rwandan , Ugandan and Burundian aggressors in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Against a background of violations of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law , the economic , social and cultural rights of the Congolese are being violated by looting , extortion and destruction of installations and property essential for the survival of the population .  65 .  Other violations of human rights and international humanitarian law deserve to be highlighted .  
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
Based on past experience and the changes brought about by the rapid globalization of the economy , there had been a growing convergence of policies that encouraged investment in human resources and government responsibility in creating a dynamic domestic framework in which the private sector could play its role as the driving force of industrial development .  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed training , dissemination and information programmes can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Even when political leaders have thoroughly good intentions , human rights norms as expressed in the Constitution and the international conventions need to be underpinned by sound legislation , an effective and independent judiciary and a non-partisan , professional police .  
In the light of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially the principles of the best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and the right to life , survival and development ( art . 6 ) , the Committee expressed its deep concern at the early legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces and recommended that the State party raise the age in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
The Special Rapporteur observes that the human tragedy of this unresolved matter is enormous , both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship , and in terms of the families of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert the utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
There is an enormous annual turnover in markets for illegal goods , such as illegal drugs , protected wildlife , stolen works of art , illegal firearms , and nuclear and / or toxic waste , as well as for trafficking in human beings .  
National plans of action for human rights education , which have been called for both by the General Assembly and the Commission , are intended to be an integral part of the national development plan ( when applicable ) and be complementary to other relevant national plans of action already defined ( general human rights plans of action or those relating to women , children , minorities , indigenous peoples , etc . ) .  
Depending on their specific mandate , field presences implement technical cooperation programmes to support governmental and civil society institutions in strengthening their capacity for the promotion and protection of human rights , through training , legal assistance , expert advice , public education and other activities .

The Assembly adopted resolution 53 / 168 on the fiftieth anniversary in which it declared its commitment to the fulfilment of the Declaration as a source of inspiration for the further promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms - political , social , civil and cultural _ including the right to development .  
The purpose of the OHCHR technical cooperation programme is to assist countries - including Governments and civil society - in promoting and protecting all human rights at the national and regional levels , through the incorporation of international human rights standards in national laws , policies and practices , and building a sustainable national capacity to implement these standards and ensure respect for human rights .  
Technical cooperation activities are based on international human rights standards as defined in the instruments adopted within the United Nations and on international practice in applying them in all regions of the world , giving balanced attention to civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
The Office of Operations leads the planning process by providing the overall framework , developing options for courses of action , leading reconnaissance missions to the field and coordinating and integrating inputs from within the Department and from other entities ( e.g . military , police , humanitarian , electoral , human rights and other aspects including logistics , support and staffing requirements ) into a comprehensive plan for approval by the Security Council .  
If , in addition , one considered the frequent violations of the human rights of the Palestinian and Arab population , the severe conditions under which members of that population were held in custody and the frequent closures of Palestinian territory , it was easy to understand how difficult it was for the Palestinian population to hold on to the optimism and hope engendered by the various peace agreements that had been concluded since 1991 .  
Even the initial analysis of the recommendations and proposals made by several United Nations bodies and mechanisms active in the field of human rights makes it possible to single out a number of major themes that could be considered by the World Conference with a view to formulating recommendations for the adoption of additional measures to combat racism at the national , regional and international levels .  
In the light of ethnic hatred , propaganda and incitement to ethnic killing in the Great Lakes region of Africa , Oxfam suggested that all Governments that prohibit and condemn racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should reinvigorate their commitment to the relevant aspects of international human rights law and international humanitarian law .  
Such a commitment could strengthen resect for the human rights of all and promote the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , in particular , key elements for peaceful coexistence , mutual understanding and tolerance among societies and the international community .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Notes that the United Nations Programme of Advisory Services and Technical Assistance in the Field of Human Rights does not have sufficient funds to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but are facing economic hardship ;  
Reiterating that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and should be promoted and implemented in a fair and equitable manner , without prejudice to the implementation of each of those rights and freedoms ,  
Each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect , promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms , inter alia , by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social , economic , political and other fields , as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction , individually and in association with others , are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice .  
This includes , inter alia , the right , individually and in association with others , to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion , protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
To complain about the policies and actions of individual officials and governmental bodies with regard to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , by petition or other appropriate means , to competent domestic judicial , administrative or legislative authorities or any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State , which should render their decision on the complaint without undue delay ;  
In this connection , everyone is entitled , individually and in association with others , to be protected effectively under national law in reacting against or opposing , through peaceful means , activities and acts , including those by omission , attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Popular and / or politically driven anti-foreigner sentiment based on racial , ethnic , national or religious characteristics is a strong obstacle both to recognition of and respect for the human rights of migrants .  
Another important group of migrants who are exposed to serious human rights abuses are those engaged in the informal economy of the receiving countries , where small and less competitive enterprises , especially in textile , garment-making and various service industries , try to save on social and labour costs by hiring cheap and often irregular migrant workers , increasingly with the help of traffickers .  
Even in countries where general human rights and social legislation is well advanced , the working and living conditions of these migrant workers are often comparable to those of the slave labour conditions prevailing at the end of the nineteenth century .  
States , in particular those which have already included international human rights standards in national legislation , should be urged to extend these basic rights to migrants explicitly , through appropriate legal enactment , due account being taken of the special needs and conditions of the various types of migrants ( recruitment , job and housing security , family reunion , education and social security ) .  
These initiatives should run parallel to , and not be regarded as a substitute for , efforts to secure increased ratification and effective implementation of the existing international treaties concerning human rights , including the 1990 Convention on migrants .  
Since the informal economy which harbours a significant proportion of irregular migrants operates largely at the periphery or outside the national protection system , States should be encouraged to extend the basic human rights standards to this sector and to enforce them , and to assist enterprises to improve their economic capacity , thereby enabling them to meet these standards .

An illegal act which violates human rights and which is initially not directly imputable to the State ( for example , because it is the act of a private person or because the person responsible has not been identified ) can lead to international responsibility of the State , not because of the act itself but because of the lack of due diligence to prevent the violation or to respond to it as required by the Convention .  
The Sudan expressed concern about the children in the southern part of the country , particularly those living in areas occupied by the rebel movement , where they were being exploited , forcibly conscripted , used as human shields , tortured and killed , which must be denounced and condemned by the entire international community .

Invites States , United Nations organs , programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries , in particular the least developed countries and those in Africa , in their efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV / AIDS on the human rights of their populations ;  
Reaffirming also that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Declares that advisory services and technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments with a view to developing national capacities in the field of human rights constitute one of the most efficient and effective means of promoting and protecting all human rights and democracy ;  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
In addition , the programme , through greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on more efficient methods to prevent human rights violations and remove obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
At continuing reports of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in China and severe restrictions on the rights of citizens to the freedoms of non _ violent assembly , association , expression and religion , as well as to due legal process and to a fair trial , including harsh sentences for some seeking to exercise their rights ;  
Recognizing that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Notes that the realization of all human rights _ civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development _ are indispensable to human dignity and the full development of human potential and are also integral to democratic society ;  
Recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ,  
Reiterates its invitation to States to promote a culture of peace based on the purposes and principles established in the Charter of the United Nations , respect for all human rights , democracy , education for peace , promotion of sustainable development , tolerance , respect for pluralism , positive acceptance of multiculturalism , the wider participation of women , and equal opportunities for all , as an integral approach to preventing violence in its diverse manifestations ;  
Believing that every woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
the same emphasis , and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Noting the expansion of the technical cooperation programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , extended upon the request of the concerned Member States , and the crucial importance of sharing information and experiences and developing and strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights ,  
Declares that advisory services and technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments with a view to developing national capacities in the field of human rights constitute one of the most efficient and effective means of promoting and protecting all human rights , democracy and the rule of law ;  
Affirms the need for technical cooperation programmes to be grounded in national developmental objectives of the countries concerned and to be aimed at supporting the achievement of national development goals , programmes and policies , in keeping with international human rights standards , utilizing , to the maximum extent possible , national expertise in human rights ;  
Invites relevant United Nations treaty bodies , special rapporteurs and special representatives , as well as working groups , to include in their recommendations proposals for specific projects to be realized under the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights with a view to contributing to practical change in the human rights situation at the grass _ roots level ;  
Calls upon the High Commissioner for Human Rights to include information on the implementation of the present resolution in her analytical report to the Commission at its fifty _ sixth session on the progress and concrete achievements made , as well as obstacles encountered , in the implementation of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights ; fifty _ seventh session .  
Subregional , regional and international organizations and concerned countries to continue and intensify the coordinated efforts aimed at facilitating the national reconciliation process in Somalia , aware of the fact that the peaceful coexistence of all parties and groups is an important foundation for the respect of human rights ;  
Recognizing that accountability of individual perpetrators of grave human rights violations is one of the central elements of any effective remedy for victims of human rights and a key factor in ensuring a fair and equitable justice system and , ultimately , reconciliation and stability within a State ,  
Expresses grave concern about numerous instances of violations of human rights , including extrajudicial executions , torture , illegal arrest and detention , and violence in relation to political activities , as detailed in the reports of the Special Representative , and calls upon the Government of Cambodia to investigate urgently and prosecute , in accordance with due process of law and international human rights standards , all those who have perpetrated these human rights violations ;  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social - and people-centered sustainable development ;  
Affirms that international cooperation is acknowledged more than ever as a necessity deriving from recognized mutual interest , and therefore that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
That the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and access to health care , as set out in article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , is an integral part of the full realization of all their human rights , which are universal , indivisible and interdependent ;  
Reaffirms the particular importance of the right of the child to education and the goals of Education for All , emphasizing the need for governments to broaden and constantly redefine the scope of basic education , including early childhood care and initial education , to develop a supporting policy context and to mobilize existing and new financial and human resources , including through concerted international action and cooperation ; 37 .  Calls upon States :  
The need for greater understanding of the genesis of conflicts was stressed , and while it was recognized that unique circumstances might differentiate conflicts , certain causes dearth of visionary leadership ; absence of good governance , especially transparency and accountability ; neglect of human rights ; pervasive poverty ; inequitable distribution of wealth and resources ; and social and cultural exclusion which breeds ethnic clashes are common to all .  
This will lead to the design of policy packages aimed at increasing physical and human capacities , taking into account the administrative requirements of such packages , sustainability concerns related to expanded production , the social and human context of polices related to international trade , and complementary measures .  The generation and optimal use of domestic finance for commodity-based development will also be part of these packages .  
To replace operative paragraph 3 by the following text , to be included in operative paragraph 2 as a new item ( i ) : ' The full promotion of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as the right to development ; ' .  
The Commission welcomes the reduction in the number of human rights violations attributed to the armed and security forces and the police , but is concerned that the armed forces have not fulfilled their intention to suspend from active service all those in their ranks who are under formal juridical or disciplinary investigation for human rights violations until guilt or innocence is determined and to dismiss them where such allegations have been proven .  
It urges the Government of Colombia to establish as soon as possible the necessary measures to guarantee a truly independent judicial system , to ensure the transfer of all judicial procedures concerning serious human rights violations currently under military penal jurisdiction to the jurisdiction of the ordinary justice system and to separate the functions of the executive and the judiciary .  
Gravely concerned by such recent outrages as the murder of three human rights defenders and mass abduction from an aircraft , for which guerrilla groups were responsible , it calls on the guerrilla groups to respect norms of international humanitarian law , especially to refrain from killings and all attacks on the civilian population , indiscriminate massacres , hostage _ taking and the widespread use of anti _ personnel landmines , and to fulfil their own pledges not to recruit children .  
The Commission expresses its profound concern over the grave situation of attacks against human rights defenders and deplores the lack of effective judicial investigations into such crimes as well as the absence of effective legal , administrative , security and financial measures to protect those social and human rights defenders who find themselves at risk .  
EU considers these positive developments as a solid basis for a stable process of change of Indonesia 's political , economic and social system leading to a civic society based on democratic principles , the rule of law and internationally accepted human rights standards .  
She extended her congratulations to the new members elected at the tenth meeting of States parties , stating that they had joined the human rights treaty body responsible for promoting and defending the rights of half of humanity .  
The Committee reaffirms that the Convention recognizes that womens rights include civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and that they are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights .  
The Committee is concerned that there is currently before Congress a bill to decriminalize domestic violence at both the civil and criminal level , passing responsibility for dealing with these human rights violations to an administrative court .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and effective criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and effective criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
At their tenth meeting , in September 1998 , the persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies reiterated their view that it was desirable to strive for focused periodic reports that would examine a limited range of issues that might be identified by the relevant treaty body in advance of the preparation of the report .  
The general human rights climate has also been worsened by the accompanying wave of protests and demonstrations , some of them violent and destructive of private property , and by the heightened sense of insecurity springing from an increase in threats and acts of intimidation , and by the spates of armed crime , acts of violence and assassinations or attempted assassinations , some of them possibly politically motivated .  
UNDP resident representatives have played a key role in telling the complex story of sustainable human development to help to increase understanding of what UNDP stands for and to generate support for the organization .  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all . 
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
With respect to the general framework within which human rights are protected and promoted , the Committee considers an independent judiciary to be an essential instrument for the protection of economic , social and cultural rights and therefore requests that information be included on the matter in the third periodic report .  
In this connection , the Special Rapporteur received consistent information that the Government of the Sudan is providing arms and ammunition to paramilitary groups such as the Murahaleen which are commonly held responsible for gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
He received well _ documented information , often from first-hand sources , pointing to the perpetration of massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict in southern Sudan , of which innocent civilians constitute the principle target and the famine is one of the direct by-products , in the context of which food is manipulated as a weapon of war .  
International cooperation in building major facilities is most effective when the project draws on the complementary capabilities of different nations , or when the project would be too expensive for individual nations to afford or if the international cooperative initiative itself represents a major challenge for human beings to achieve a particular goal .  
The model selected will constitute a missing element in the range of tools available at present to the astrophysical community for the exploration of the universe , extending from the near solar environment to the far distant phases of evolution , when the basic building blocks of human life were being created .  
At the international level , a main objective of development assistance should be to support national efforts for sustained human capital formation .  
Annual meetings during which all the major problems of society are discussed , with very structured progressive legal proposals ( many of which served as the basis for national legislative systems ) : the right of women to equality in all fields , not out of a rather empty feminism but out of simple respect for human rights . 
Despite the recommendations to the Colombian Government to dismantle the system of regional justice and faceless judges , efforts are being made to extend this system so as to continue unfair trials of workers , those who fight for the people , defenders of human rights and political opponents ; simply voicing an opinion that differs from the establishment view is cause enough for being put on trial .  This is tantamount to making social and popular protest a criminal offence .  
We are deeply concerned at the situation of human rights in Mexico , where the same methods are being applied as were used in our country , like the establishment of paramilitary groups , selective assassination and the extermination of civic and popular leaders of the indigenous and peasant communities .  
It was stated that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources , and continued strong political commitment were crucial .  
Reaffirmation of the importance attached to the work of IAEA regarding multilateral technical cooperation in the development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and call again for every effort to be made to ensure that IAEA has the necessary financial and human resources to meet its responsibilities in the area of technical cooperation , safeguards and nuclear safety .

A steering committee , comprised mainly of human resource specialists drawn from several organizations of the United Nations system , supervised the pilot , which was conducted , in close consultation with UNDG and CCPOQ , by a specialized firm selected on the basis of competitive bidding . 
A common theme in each report is the need for a comprehensive approach , elaborated jointly with national authorities , other United Nations agencies , the Bretton Woods institutions and major donors , and linking the political , humanitarian , human rights and development concerns .  
Firm-level technological development depends on external factors such as interaction with the local economic environment , which provides the human and financial resources needed for the cultivation of internal capability and essential services such as standard setting , testing , basic R &amp; amp ; D and other forms of institutional support that enable firms to conduct in-house technical work effectively . 
Indeed , it has now become common practice for the leadership in Addis Ababa to flagrantly violate fundamental principles of international law - whether it is in acts of brazen aggression , human rights violations or blatant incursions against neighbouring countries - and then accuse its victims for the very transgressions that it is guilty of in a pre-emptive , if transparent , manner . 
For the information of the Sub-Commission , the secretariat has also prepared ( annex II ) a list of country situations currently being considered by the Commission under the agenda items entitled Organization of the work of the session , The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and Advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights . the occupied Arab territories ,  
Accounts received by the High Commissioner and OHCHR staff in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Albania and Montenegro ( Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) provide substantial evidence of gross human rights violations which have been committed in Kosovo , including summary executions , forcible displacement , rape , physical abuse , and the destruction of property and identity documents .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
Consistency with current international law requires that the child be defined as every human being below the age of eighteen years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier ( article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) ) .  
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
Finally , some delegations pointed out that the main constraints to the effective and expanded application of TCDC / ECDC remain the lack of clearly defined national TCDC policies , insufficient awareness of TCDC 's full potential and importance , and inadequate provision of human and financial resources for TCDC .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
Although there was a drop in the number of reported cases of gross human rights violations during March , escapees from rebel-held territories continued to provide disturbing accounts of abusive rebel behaviour against civilians , including physical and psychological torture and harassment .  
Among the core principles of the Africa Partnership are : national commitment and ownership ; political action ; joint national strategic action plans ; mobilization of increased resources ; stronger regional technical platforms for action ; protection of human rights ; compassion and solidarity .  
In conclusion , the Committees proposal for an additional regular session to be held in New York is driven by a commitment to the interdependence and indivisibility of all rights , as well as a recognition of the renewed interest in economic , social and cultural rights which is evident in the work of the United Nations human rights system .  
In its resolution 1997 / 36 , of 28 August 1997 , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities authorized Ms . Clemencia Forero Ucros to prepare a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , for submission to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
Hence , the intractable problems and legal dilemmas posed by the human rights notions and pretexts invoked by the opposing sides engaged in this vicious circle of controversial aims and doubtful means .  
While they may mean different things to different people , 29 / depending on their philosophical , ideological , political , cultural , social and economic perspectives , all agree that the expression a democratic society referred to in the Universal Declaration and in both International Covenants 30 / is a vital concept for human rights based on common values shared by human beings throughout the world community .  
Proceeding from these ideas , it is assumed that a democratic society requires the existence and free exercise of certain basic individual and group rights and freedoms , which the Universal Declaration and the International Covenants - not to mention at this juncture other international , regional and national human rights instruments , norms and standards - define and thereby indicate their limits .  
A democratic society , moreover , whatever may be the cultural , political , social and economic framework in which it is achieved , is identified by certain principles and institutions , such as pluralism , the rule of law , legitimacy , political equality , popular control and public accountability of government , which , again , have their starting point in human rights and freedoms .  
Believing that youth concerns should be dealt with using an integrated approach which should allow young people , who are designated key partners for the achievement of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in paragraphs 182 ( n ) , 120 ( a ) and 120 ( b ) of the Habitat Agenda , 1 to participate fully on local , national , regional and international levels ,  
While pointing out that peace was a prerequisite for development , a number of delegations stated that , in recent years , armed conflict had exacted and was continuing to exact a heavy toll on human settlements and human settlements development and several called on the Centre to provide reconstruction assistance to countries and regions afflicted by armed conflict and natural and man-made disasters .  
Many delegations cited specific examples of how local authorities and non-governmental organizations were being strengthened and actively involved in policies and programmes to achieve adequate shelter and sustainable development of human settlements in their respective countries .  
The Commission has been blocked by a procedural decision , without even the recourse to any substantive explanation as to why it should not be allowed or , to be more precise , why it is not desirable for Habitat to mobilize the efforts of the international community and to develop measures to rebuild the ruined human settlements within Yugoslavia , which is what is called for in the Russian draft resolution .  
Finally , some delegations pointed out that the main constraints to the effective and expanded application of TCDC / ECDC remain the lack of clearly defined national TCDC policies , insufficient awareness of TCDC 's full potential and importance , and inadequate provision of human and financial resources for TCDC .  
A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .  
It is essential to fight for respect of human rights and norms of international humanitarian law , but solely through political and legal methods on the firm basis of the United Nations Charter and the relevant multilateral instruments .  
It is neither new nor extraordinary for the Commission on Human Rights to be manipulated , but it is serious that that Commission has not stated that the aerial campaign is a massive , flagrant , delirious and systematic violation of human rights .  
It is in this framework and with these purposes in mind that Hungary expresses its strong desire to live side by side with a democratic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at peace with its ethnic communities , respectful of all human rights , including the rights of national minorities , and thus ready to rejoin the community of nations .  
Albania highly appreciates the irreplaceable role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , which stopped one of the greatest human catastrophes in Europe after the Second World War and which brought to a halt the genocide and the ethnic cleansing carried out against millions of innocent Albanian civilians in the heart of Europe , thereby protecting the best values of our world civilization .  
This political solution should be followed by specific steps towards the establishment of the structures necessary for a civilian administration , economic rebuilding and development , democratic institutions and the rule of law , as well as security and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms for all , regardless of ethnic background or religious affiliation .  
While Mexico shares the outrage of the international community over the abuses of basic human , family and community rights , it has stated that the use of force , even inspired by the most noble humanitarian cause , leads to more violence and is hardly conducive to a lasting solution to problems .  
The discussions between high-level panellists and the audience , both of whom are composed of representatives of member States , local and regional NGOs , academics and opinion leaders , will focus on the main areas of the United Nations , including its role in the areas of peace and security , economic and social development cooperation , humanitarian relief and human rights .  
The crisis in Kosovo has resulted in the mass forced displacement and deportation of hundreds of thousands of civilians , wholesale destruction of property and means of livelihood , wanton lawlessness and violence , thousands of documented killings , countless as-yet undocumented deaths , and immeasurable human suffering .  
Refugees who have arrived in neighbouring countries have given consistent accounts of civilians being subjected to systematic and extreme human rights violations by security forces , of executions , of forced eviction from their homes , deportations , arbitrary detention , acts of sexual violence and burning of homes .  
Projects aimed at the strengthening of macroeconomic management capacity , legislative systems , the legal framework , the judiciary , civilian police and election management capacity , along with mechanisms for political reconciliation , public administration and civil service reform , inter alia , must be explored , particularly in Kosovo , taking advantage of national human resources , experience and skills .  
In addition to the human costs of the conflict , evidenced notably by numerous civilian casualties , the destruction of major industries by the air bombardment , as well as damage caused to infrastructure and essential services such as water and electricity supply , health services , education , communications , heating , the damage to land and river transportation links and the loss of trade , have caused tremendous economic and social hardship for the civilian populations . 
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ( author 's emphasis ) . 
As a result of the compromise reached , Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations defines one of the Organization 's purposes as being to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
All of this demonstrates that human rights have become a matter of international legal regulation and international protection , and the individual is considered to be a subject of international law with a clearly defined legal personality .  
Considering further that the States Members of the United Nations , by adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , reaffirmed their commitment to the observance of fundamental human rights , their faith in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women , and their determination to promote , in cooperation with the United Nations , the universal observance of civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights ,  
An entire new cluster of WHO technical programmes has also been established to promote health in the context of sustainable human development , including a renewed emphasis on reducing malnutrition and improving management of environmental risks to human health , integrating health dimensions into poverty reduction programmes and protecting vulnerable populations in situations of crisis and post-crisis ; promoting the synergy between health and human rights constitutes an additional priority .  
Improved coordination among the national and international institutions charged with developing and encouraging the adoption of policies and measures to meet human needs , without undermining the environmental foundation for development ;  
The studies carried out in those areas have all contributed to a better understanding of the real conditions prevailing in the country and have led to the adoption of better focused development plans and strategies , which in turn have improved the management of physical , human and financial resources and have guaranteed their rational use , while also yielding a corresponding increase in productivity .  
There is a real threat that it may become an epoch in which the unmitigated promotion of increased international trade , investment and finance at the expense of the observance and protection of fundamental human rights and sustainable human development ( SHD ) is adopted as a mantra guiding many Governments and development economists as was amply demonstrated in the MAI process .  
The issue under discussion involves both conceptual as well as empirical dimensions , some of which are already under consideration by the Sub _ Commission and the Commission on Human Rights . 17 / It also involves both categories of human rights , viz . , the civil and political , and the economic , social and cultural . 
A major success of the Decade has been a widespread acceptance of the fact that the growing risk of disasters associated with natural hazards , frequently compounded by uncontrolled or adverse human practices , must be mitigated .  
Banking and financial institutions , international technical assistance organizations and the specialized abilities of various United Nations agencies all have a role to play in ensuring that human , technical and material resources are wisely directed to sustained programmes of applied disaster mitigation practices .  
In industrialized countries too , with an increasing interdependency between information , complex technological facilities , human systems and hazards , there is now the potential for catastrophic failures on a global basis , as the example of the year 2000 computer problem has demonstrated .  
Equally , the relationship between human behaviour and biomedical risks has also become more evident , exacerbated by the ease of rapid international transmission of public health and environmental health hazards , including food contamination , as seen for instance in the dramatic spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) throughout the world .  
By resolution 8 ( XXIII ) of 16 March 1967 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to give annual consideration to the item entitled Question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including policies of racial discrimination and segregation and of apartheid , in all countries , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 20 _ 21 and 29 _ 37 above ) . 
At its forty _ fifth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its resolution 1993 / 40 , decided to entrust Mr . Asbjrn Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels , taking also into account matters related to the realization of the right to development .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
At its forty _ ninth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1997 / 107 taking note that it did not have sufficient time for a comprehensive discussion of the final report of the Special Rapporteur on income distribution and human rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 9 ) , decided to postpone to its fiftieth session the presentation by Mr . Bengoa of his final report and to request him to complete his report by preparing a supplementary document on this issue .  
In addition , it decided to appoint Mrs . Mara Concepcin Bautista to prepare a report on the application of international standards concerning the human rights of detained juveniles , in particular the separation of juvenile and adult offenders in penal institutions , detention pending trial , least possible use of institutionalization and the objectives of institutional treatment .  
At its fiftieth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1998 / 112 , decided to continue consideration of the adverse consequences of economic sanctions on human rights at its fifty _ first session under the agenda sub _ item entitled Implications of humanitarian activities for the enjoyment of human rights .  
At its forty _ fourth session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its decision 1998 / 107 , decided to approve the appointment of Mrs . Koufa as Special Rapporteur to conduct a comprehensive study on terrorism and human rights on the basis of her working paper , and to request the Special Rapporteur to submit her preliminary report to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session , a progress report at its fifty _ first session and a final report at its fifty _ second session .  
Their primary objective should be to seek , through their presence and contacts with the local authorities , to promote respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deter massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the future .  
In response to reports of summary executions of non-combatants , including women and children , in their homes , arbitrary detentions , forced displacement , use of forced labour and burning of homes and property in the central highlands of Hazarajat , the Special Rapporteur visited Quetta , Pakistan , on 22 May where he met refugees who provided credible eye-witness accounts of gross violations of human rights during March , April and May 1999 . 
The chronic fighting and the resultant political uncertainty has exacerbated the human misery of innocent Afghan people , who have already suffered for too long and are the real victims of this endless war .  
Particular consideration should be given , in these cases , to the practical day-to-day consequences ( sometimes grave ) of the lack of such agreements for the juridical and political status of the peoples concerned in the mixed societies in which they now live , and for the preservation , promotion and effective realization of their historical rights as peoples , including their human rights and freedoms . 
Nor is it by chance that the Commission , on the very date on which it established the Special Rapporteurs mandate , recognized ( in impeccable diplomatic parlance ) that in various situations , indigenous peoples are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms ( Commission resolution 1989 / 34 of 6 March 1989 , sixth preambular paragraph ) .  
As far as his mandate is concerned , it must be recalled that the main purpose of the study is to analyse the potential utility of treaties , agreements and other constructive arrangements between indigenous peoples and Governments for the purpose of ensuring the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those peoples .  
As stated in the Secretary-Generals report on human resources management ( A / 53 / 342 , para . 52 ) , the Organizations career development policy is based on the principle that responsibility for career growth and development is shared : by the Organization , which must provide structural support and a framework of opportunities ; by managers , who must support their staffs development and career progress ; and by the staff members themselves , who must be committed to continuous professional growth .  
The overall goals of life science observation was therefore to use the unique environment of space flight to study the response of the human organism to specific stresses , to increase understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the neuroendocrine , developmental and behavioural changes that occur in space flight , to obtain new data to enhance human space flight and to apply the results of space research for the health , well-being and economic benefit of people on Earth .  
They constituted steps in a process towards a better understanding of the relationship between human rights and development , and a recognition that economic and social rights are as indispensable as civil and political rights .  
To promote optimal allocation and use of public and private investments to foster human resources , sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries and forestry systems , and rural development , in high and low potential areas ;  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all .  
It sets out the normative content of the human right to adequate food , the corresponding obligations including State obligations at the national level and at the international level , the responsibilities of international organizations , and regulation of economic enterprises and other actors .  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all .  
The orthodox view of exhaustion of local remedies was the procedural view , namely , that the wrong might have occurred but no international action could be taken by way of a diplomatic claim or human rights complaint prior to the exhaustion of local remedies .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the document entitled " White paper on massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) and their Congolese accomplices in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo : Volume II " , covering the period from 6 November 1998 to 15 April 1999 ( see annex ) .  
In the first volume of the white paper , the Ministry of Human Rights concentrated on the massive violations of human rights and of the basic rules of international humanitarian law by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
As part of an effort to make both national and international public opinion aware of the massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards , the Government of National Salvation , through the Ministry of Human Rights , has taken the initiative of issuing periodic publications which provide a summary account of the conduct of the aggressor States of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
A number of functional commissions did not concur with proposals , contained , inter alia , in the 1998 consolidated report ( E / 1999 / 3 ) that certain topics , such as gender equality and human rights , should be addressed exclusively by the single functional commission which has the primary responsibility for the subject matter , in particular in the context of implementation and follow-up to a major conference .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  6 .  The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
This revolution is aimed at developing the country 's human resources by ensuring that the education system is relevant and geared to equip students with the requisite knowledge , skills and abilities for sustained , successful living in the twenty-first century .  
Within the framework of respect for human rights and strengthening democracy , the Bolivian State intends to continue seeking alternative models for dealing with sexual and reproductive health within the context of the social , economic , political and cultural factors that come into play in health matters .  
A strategy has been implemented on the basis of the principles of sustainable human development , the continued growth in acquiring new knowledge , culture , the spirit of invention and popular participation through the establishment of an organized , stable and strong society with transparent and efficient institutions .  
The implementation of this strategy has yielded tangible progress in understanding the situation of our population , which is indispensable for adjusting demographic trends and certain social behaviours that are not conducive to sustainable human development .  
In a globalizing world , island nations such as ours , with limited natural resources and human capital , urgently need the support and assistance of the international community in overcoming our inherent vulnerabilities and realizing the hopes and aspirations of our peoples for achieving lasting and meaningful development .  
It is aimed at addressing a range of interrelated challenges , protecting individual social and economic rights and human rights in general , providing legal protections and creating conditions to protect the cultural , spiritual and intellectual interests of our people .  
Quality of life is determined not simply by material goods , but is made up of a whole set of simultaneously interwoven factors : health , education , employment , elimination of poverty , respect of human rights , the possibility of self-fulfilment , social and cultural integration and living in an ecologically enlightened environment .  
We are also committed to developing cooperation with countries of origin , but we believe that a constructive approach to international migration implies first and foremost the protection of the human rights and dignity of all migrants , irrespective of their legal status , including through the adoption and enforcement of legal instruments , both national and international . 
In Libya , development is based on improving the quality of life through democratic institutions built on popular participation , the rule of law and full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , by increasing economic opportunities and aiming for equality and fairness between the sexes .  
The objectives of this programme have focused on bettering the standard of living , diversifying the structure of the national economy and the sources of revenue , on social equity , a balanced development , and the development and evolution of human resources .  
From our point of view , the crisis in the Balkans should encourage the international community to seek a better understanding of the extreme importance of joint activities , within the framework of decisions taken by United Nations bodies , towards the settlement of ethnic conflicts by peaceful means in order to maintain peace , protect human rights and provide an opportunity to every person for the unhampered achievement of his or her human and spiritual potential .  
This plan revolves around seven priority areas : first , improvement of the living conditions of women ; second , improvement of the legal status of women ; third , development of female human resources in all the development sectors ; fourth , access by women to effective decision-making ; fifth , promotion and protection of the girl child ; sixth , combatting violence against women ; and seventh , improvement of the institutional framework .  
In this respect , a negative role is played by , among other factors , the country 's particular economic structure inherited from the former Soviet Union , which is incapable of meeting the requirements of a market economy ; Tajikistan 's geographic remoteness , which has a significant detrimental effect on external economic activity ; and mountainous terrain that makes a mere 7 per cent of our country suitable for human settlement .  
These include ( a ) strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing distortions so as to encourage private sector investment ; ( b ) improving the quality of government spending in order to invest in basic social services and raise the level of human capital ; and ( c ) rationalizing the assistance provided by external donors .  
The view was expressed that the decision on ratification as well as on rationalization and adaptation of the human rights machinery at the national level was the prerogative of individual sovereign countries rather than an initiative taken by the departments concerned .  
In this context of violence and cruelty , the Special Rapporteur wishes to note that regardless of the atrocities committed and the bleak and inhuman atmosphere described in numerous accounts and testimonies , there have been some remarkable acts of integrity , courage and compassion on the part of persons who at great personal risk have attempted to assist or rescue victims of human rights abuses .  
Given the limited nature of UNHCRs involvement in Colombia , it is recognized that UNHCRs support will only be effective if linked to broader efforts to uphold international humanitarian law and to strengthen respect for human rights , within the context of a common approach with other United Nations partners .  
Initiated in January 1998 , this process was broadened over the course of the last year to engage a wide range of non-state actors - - including major human rights and humanitarian NGOs , United Nations sister agencies and the corporate sector - - in a series of dialogues on the nature and dimensions of the current protection challenges ; where the main problems lie ; and what States and organizations might do together with UNHCR to ensure improved and sustained support for protection principles .  
Similarly , the ILO / UNESCO recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers states in its Guiding Principles that education from the earliest school years should be directed to the all _ round development of the human personality and to the spiritual , moral , social , cultural and economic progress of the community , as well as to the inculcation of deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the ability of every person to become a useful member of society , the promotion of understanding , tolerance and friendship among all nations , all racial , ethnic and religious groups are at once the origin , condition and consequence of education aimed at personal development and based on the higher interests of the person educated : 
These needs comprise both essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions and to continue learning ( art . 1 , para . 
There must be no misunderstanding : here we are dealing with apparently simple principles which require those involved in education to strike out in genuinely new directions , either in order to take a concept of education that is still too narrow and individualistic and open it up to universal values or in order to take an education that is too universalist or ideological and refocus it on the human person .  
Without success in this area it is hardly possible to create the stable , just and democratic political environment which in turn is an indispensable precondition for sustainable human , economic and social development .  
Mechanisms were also to foster national reconciliation , such as the Truth Commission , whose mandate was to shed light on the most relevant cases of human rights violations , the ad hoc committee responsible for purging the armed forces and the Peace Commission ( COPAZ ) , which was responsible for safeguarding and ensuring compliance with commitments undertaken to promote assistance and community development , mainly in the agricultural sector .  
In exercising their functions , all persons undertaking public duties or holding public office in Kosovo will be required to observe internationally recognized human rights standards , and shall not discriminate against any person on any grounds , such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , association with a national community , property , birth or other status .  
It had been urged that it was imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights .  
The improvement of the overall human rights situation would require the emergence of a framework for building peace through an inclusive participatory process involving continuing consultations with all segments of the Afghan people , aimed at establishing a broad _ based , multi _ ethnic and fully representative government .  
Paragraph 1 does not apply to international obligations which are expressed or intended to be obligations of total restraint even for States engaged in armed conflict or acting in self-defence , and in particular to obligations of a humanitarian character relating to the protection of the human person in time of armed conflict or national emergency . 
Within the Palestinian Police Force , UNHCHR has established a cadre of qualified human rights and law enforcement peer trainers and intends to work further with such trainers , through advanced training fellowships and technical assistance , to develop an institutionalized code of conduct and standing orders consistent with international human rights standards .  
The Council expresses its concern , in the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Geneva Conventions , about the continuous erosion , in many cases , in the respect for international humanitarian and human rights law and principles , both in terms of denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need and through deliberate violence against all those protected under international humanitarian law , especially women and children .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
_ that free legal and other assistance is provided to trafficked persons and persons in prostitution in the course of any criminal , civil and other action against traffickers and those who violate the human rights of trafficked persons and persons in prostitution , including a temporary or permanent residence permit and a safe shelter ;  
In view of these circumstances , and seeking to gather more information on all aspects of the question of remote interpretation in the technical , financial and human resources fields , it has been provisionally decided to organize another experiment , as comprehensive as the one conducted earlier this year , but now entailing the servicing from Geneva of a two-week meeting to be held at Nairobi as early as possible in 2000 .  
That the proposed Decade was both a moral imperative and an opportunity for the world community , in a spirit of global cooperation , to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to alleviate human suffering and enhance economic security ;  
The African continent is subject to a wide range of natural hazards , and suffers constantly from natural and other disasters , which have serious adverse effects on societies and national economies as well as on scarce human and material resources .  
Given the lack of educated and trained manpower , international efforts are required to ensure that sufficient opportunities are available to developing countries to build their human resource base in different areas of space technology and its applications ;  
On that basis , the majority of Libyan legislative acts promulgated after the Great Revolution of 1 September are directed at all citizens , irrespective of gender ; they prescribe numerous rights to be enjoyed in all fields , without distinction between men and women , in so far as they are fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , both male and female .  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term " discrimination against women " shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
Most Libyan legislative acts are directed at all citizens , irrespective of their sex , and prescribe the body of rights which they enjoy in the political , functional , economic , social , cultural , health and educational fields , without discrimination between men and women , being fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , whether male or female .  
Globalization , diversification of forms of migration , the declining role of State leadership in migration , decrease of State _ organized migration as compared to spontaneous migration , increase in temporary migration , growth of private recruitment agencies , increase in irregular migration , trade in human beings and - what is very important - feminization of migration have substantially changed the context of contemporary migration .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
The European Union commends the efforts of OAU and all those who have supported it in its search for a peaceful solution to the conflict , which has caused enormous human and physical losses in Ethiopia and Eritrea , jeopardizes political and economic stability in the two countries and in the region , and undermines their capacity to attract foreign support needed for their development .  
Consolidate democracy through the promotion of pluralism , the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , maximizing the participation of citizens in decision-making and the development of competent public institutions , including an independent judiciary , responsible legislature and public service and an electoral system that ensures free and fair elections .  
Recognizing that the world was stepping into the twenty-first century with the burden of many unresolved conflicts and stalemated peace processes , the meeting stressed that those conflicts posed a threat to peace and drained the scarce resources of the world , which were urgently required for the development and prosperity of the human race .  
Apart from training of developing human resources at the basic level of science and technology and fostering South-South cooperation , the regional centres for space science and technology education and relevant existing national institutions should organize specific training programmes to contribute to the building of regional and local expertise and ultimately to the success of know-how and technology transfer programmes .  
The NGO community , which has contributed enormously to strengthening the human rights regime , especially regarding civil and political rights , is now moving enthusiastically to operate at the grass _ roots level to deliver economic , social and cultural rights .  
The adoption by the United Nations in 1986 of the Declaration on the Right to Development was the culmination of a long process of international deliberation on human rights which were perceived from the very beginning as an integrated whole of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
After that , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 clearly recognized the unity of all those rights and elaborated the theme , as noted later in the preamble to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that , the ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights , as well as his economic , social and cultural rights .  
As early as 1968 , the Proclamation of Tehran stated : since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible .  
In 1969 the Declaration on Social Progress and Development further emphasized the interdependence of these two sets of rights , and by the early 1970s the concept of the right to development emerged as a human right that unified in itself the civil and political rights as well as the economic , social and cultural rights .  
The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Similarly , the recommendation regarding the civil society and non-governmental organizations , encouraging their greater participation , especially of those groups that represent the vulnerable sections , such as the poor , the homeless and the unemployed , and the public interest ( e.g . consumer , environmental , human rights and women 's organizations ) , in the local and national decision-making , would be equally important .  
As mentioned above , in most situations of realizing human rights in a particular country , there is so much waste and inefficient use of domestic resources that substantial progress can be made in improving the realization of most human rights even within the existing resources , which can be augmented by international cooperation for which a call has been given explicitly in the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
It states : The right to Development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
Then , there is a process of economic , social , cultural and political development , which is recognized as one in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
To appreciate fully the emphasis the Declaration puts on international cooperation , article 4 should be read in conjunction with the opening sentence of the preamble to the Declaration which refers to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations relating to the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural and humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The importance of the last element derives from the fact that the right to development is a human right , and as such it is interdependent and indivisible with other civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in the sense that the denial of any one of these rights would tend to deny the right to development itself .  
Most importantly , as constituent components of human rights , these rights have to be achieved following the human rights approach , with full respect for civil and political rights and , with the effective participation of all concerned , equal opportunity of access and fair distribution of the benefits of development .  
The academic community has assisted the United Nations human rights machinery by , among other things , developing two sets of guidelines known as the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( 1986 ) , elaborated in 1997 in the Maastricht guidelines on violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Independent national human rights institutions , acting in accordance with the 1991 Paris Principles , play an important role in the realization of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , as was stressed by the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No . 10 ( 1998 ) .  
While further developing close cooperation with regional human rights organizations , the Office intends , therefore , to intensify its programme of cooperation at the regional and subregional level , a significant portion of which will focus on economic , social and cultural rights .  
The debt overhang , inadequate external finance - exemplified by the decline in ODA - limited market access for exports , severe supply-side constraints , deterioration in human welfare and the increasing number of humanitarian and natural disasters have adversely impacted on the economic performance of LDCs . 
While the Committee is aware that the full implementation of the new juvenile justice system requires substantial financial and human resources as well as the development of infrastructure , as established in the document entitled Transformation and investment in the human rights of children and adolescents ( May 1999 ) , it remains concerned that the juvenile justice system is not fully implemented .  
A large number of non-governmental organizations - international , foreign and domestic - work in Uganda in areas related to the right to education ( such as social development , literacy , special education , gender , human rights ) but few explicitly address that right , thus exacerbating the paucity of conceptual and analytical work necessary for its promotion and protection .  
This is particularly visible with regard to the eradication of poverty , which needs a human rights underpinning , as well as concerning economic , social and cultural rights for which operationalization wavers between an unrealistic expectation that the Government will provide necessary services to all free of charge , and surrender in the face of the combined obstacles of poverty and debt servicing . 
Although the growing influence of bilateral donors and conditionalities attached to their aid for education have increased the Governments budgetary allocation for primary education , this influence has not encompassed facilitating a translation of Ugandas human rights obligations - including those concerning primary education - into recognized and enforceable rights .  
They noted the multifaceted nature of the concept , which combines political , ideological , economic , social , cultural and ethical criteria , and identified its main elements , such as transparency in public administration , accountability , respect for human rights and legality , promotion of democracy and enhanced management of resources . 
Ensure that United Nations missions aimed at peace-making , peacekeeping and peace-building include a mass media component that can disseminate information about international humanitarian law and human rights law , including peace education and children 's protection , while also giving objective information about the activities of the United Nations , and encourage authorized regional missions to include such a capacity .  
Underscore the importance of compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law in the conduct of all peacekeeping operations by urging that Member States disseminate instructions among their personnel serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations and among those participating in authorized operations conducted under national or regional command and control .  
Holy See suggested the following text : Full respect for human dignity , human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as the various religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds , philosophical convictions of its people , and peace and security , are also crucial for social development . 
The main objectives of the initiative were to strengthen mutual confidence and understanding between UNDP and the specialized agencies through annual consultations and improved information exchange ; to work together more effectively in support of national development priorities and Member States goals through joint strategies , research and resource mobilization ; to improve management and achieve economies of scale through pooling of networks and human resources ; and to review existing tools .  
The BSEC Charters preamble reaffirms the common will of its member States to adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter and share the vision of their regional cooperation as part of the integration process in Europe , based on human rights and fundamental freedoms , prosperity through economic liberty , social justice , and equal security and stability , which is open for interaction with other countries , regional initiatives and international organizations and financial institutions .  
This cooperation is not confined to official endeavours undertaken by the Kuwaiti Government ; the State is also encouraging national institutions and individuals to provide aid and assistance to those in need thereof in other countries , regardless of the origin or cause of that need which might be attributable to poverty , natural disasters , human conflicts or other causes of human suffering which the State of Kuwait is endeavouring to combat and alleviate .  
From my perspective the basic premise upon which the CD is established is the conviction that measures to promote and achieve non _ proliferation , arms control and disarmament are vital dimensions of a complex and comprehensive effort to enhance international security between sovereign States and to secure human security for all . 
An indigenous representative from Manipur in India said that recent developments in India indicated that existing domestic and international mechanisms to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples , including children , and to conserve vital wetlands and sensitive eco-zones of spiritual value had failed to fulfil their objectives , despite strong efforts by the indigenous peoples in Manipur to protect their human rights .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
" 17 .  UNCTAD , in cooperation with other relevant international organizations and within existing human and financial resources , should seek to assist developing countries , upon request , in understanding the implications of various legislative approaches to accommodating electronic commerce ; "  
The developing economies where 60 per cent of the worlds elderly now live , rising to 70 per cent in 20 years are challenged to develop human and economic capital while strengthening the social capital of family and community security systems .  
The four elements can be rendered dynamic by blending them with the idea of generating capital in four areas human , socio-cultural , economic and environmental in order to produce a proactive and wealth-creating approach to ageing , going beyond a mere reactive , or maintenance , stance .  
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
The Bureau 's report also appears to overlook the balances achieved in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , reaffirmed the universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated nature of human rights and the need for the international community to treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis .  The Bureau 's report , on the one hand , focuses mainly on promoting civil and political rights .  
As a result , the need to ensure the principle of the indivisibility of human rights by directly addressing the existing imbalance between civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other , appears to have been neglected .  
Similarly , the creation and establishment of a balanced human rights programme and the need to allocate adequate human and financial resources to capacity building , the right to development , economic , social and cultural rights , technical cooperation etc . , are also missing from the report .  Alternative recommendation 2 : To include the establishment of a balanced human rights programme on the agenda of the working group referred to above .  
According to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , international cooperation should be paramount in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
The success of the review of the mechanisms can best be judged by achieving such a balance through concrete proposals , such as assigning equal budgetary and human resources to both civil and political and to economic , social and cultural rights .  
What is therefore required is a developmental approach to human rights , keeping in mind that all human rights are indivisible and the need for adequate importance to be given to economic , social and cultural rights .  
Additionally , we would like to reiterate our suggestion contained in the previous written submission that the Working Group on Communications at its first meeting would be requested to ensure that 1503 submissions meet the following preconditions : ( a ) domestic remedies have been exhausted ; ( b ) the matter under consideration is demonstrably a gross and reliably attested violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; ( c ) the submissions are clearly devoid of politicization .  
Given the recognized and authentic relationship which exists between disarmament and development and because it is immoral and unacceptable to squander resources on armaments while the needs of billions of human beings so unsatisfied , the final document resulting from the first special session devoted to disarmament , held in 1978 , included various references to the question in its paragraphs 16 , 35 , 89 , 94 and 95 .  
Furthermore , our feelings of incredulity and indignation are accompanied by the conviction that many of the economic and social problems which overwhelm and cause distress to the majority of human beings could be alleviated in considerable measure if only a fraction of the resources devoted to military expenditures were utilized for the noble objective of the progress and well-being of the peoples of the world .  
In addition , the Office has developed a specific anti-trafficking programme whose objective is to work towards the integration of human rights into international , regional and national anti-trafficking initiatives , with emphasis on legal and policy development .  
A series of round tables , expert meetings and regional consultations have been organized on key issues , such as adolescent sexual and reproductive health ( New York , 1417 April 1998 ) and implementing reproductive rights and implementing sexual and reproductive health programmes , including womens empowerment , male involvement and human rights ( 2225 June 1998 ) .  
UNICEF has also widely disseminated a conceptual framework on UNICEFs human rights approach , a discussion paper on indicators for global monitoring of child rights , a paper on human rights for children and women , a series of animated child rights cartoons , and will release throughout 1999 a series of working papers compiling the relevant international standards in relation to children in armed conflict , girls , child labour and sexual exploitation .  
The focus on human rights standards is further reflected in the technical assistance provided to Governments and in the strengthening of the institutional and legal environment ; in the drafting of new constitutions ; the reform of civil and penal laws and the establishment or rehabilitation of juvenile courts .  
" The Sudan has witnessed important political and constitutional developments in the last 10 years , including the Peace Agreement , which includes the right to and self-determination for south Sudan , dialogue over national reconciliation , political pluralism , the positive developments in the country 's relations with its neighbours and the European Union and close cooperation with the United Nations in humanitarian issues and human rights .  
Canada believes that the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons ( hereinafter referred to as small arms ) have now been widely recognized as an important issue affecting international as well as human security , one that demands urgent action .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
The demand for small arms and light weapons is caused primarily by ethnic and religious conflict , economic and social exclusion , poor governance , lack of respect for the rule of law , lack of democratic institutions and lack of respect for human rights .  
My personal hope is that the projected dialogue of civilizations will eventuate at some future point in a formal statement on human values , not a charter or compact containing strictures that would be formally binding on its signatories , but a statement of fundamental human values that elaborates their bases in belief and thought as understood in different civilizational traditions .  
Moreover , the joint UNDP / UNCTAD Programme on Globalization , Liberalization and Sustainable Human Development , which was initiated in 1998 , supports the development of a conceptual and analytical framework articulating globalization and sustainable human development and the strengthening of the negotiation capacities of poor countries , to enable them to participate better in the negotiations of multilateral trade , investment and financial agreements .  
The international community , particularly the developed countries , collectively committed itself to a significant and substantial increase in supporting the efforts of the least developed countries to mobilize and develop their human capacities and the development of their economic base .  
The theme would include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bio-ethics , bio-safety , bio-diversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment . 
There can be no doubt that the atrocities committed against the civilian population of Sierra Leone , including widespread systematic killings , rapes and amputations , constitute massive violations of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
During 1997-1998 , projects have focused on : combating drugs , arms trafficking and organized crime ; assisting in mine clearance ; supporting regional integration and democratization ; increasing competence and institution building in public administration ; human resources development ; rehabilitation and development of the transport sector ; promotion of trade and investment ; improving land , water and energy resources management ; and HIV / AIDS prevention .  
According to the indictment , many of the detainees under the accused 's control were subjected to inhumane treatment , including excessive and cruel interrogation , physical and psychological harm , forced labour in hazardous conditions and being used as " human shields " , and some of the detainees were murdered or otherwise killed .  
With regard to the latter decision , the Trial Chamber stated that " [ international humanitarian law ] does not lay down synallagmatic obligations , i.e . obligations based on reciprocity , but obligations erga omnes ( or , in the case of treaty obligations , obligations erga omnes contractantes ) which are designed to safeguard fundamental human values and therefore must be complied with regardless of the conduct of the other party or parties . "  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing . 
If not , the Security Council will impress upon the world public that the United States Government has abused the United Nations name to protect KLA terrorists , to cover up mass human rights violations and make possible the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and Metohija , thus creating a state which is both illegal and untenable .  
We can not but sound the alarm regarding information on new gross violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including reports of mass shootings , arrests and forcible relocations of hundreds of thousands of peaceful inhabitants of Afghanistan .  
The project will lead to the development or harmonization of relevant legal instruments and to improved coordination among the concerned institutions and , based on an analysis of the institutional capacity to respond to that form of crime , will contribute to the development of a national strategy and elements of a subregional strategy against trafficking in human beings .  
It reads : To play a leading role in advancing comprehensive and sustainable human development through the enhanced participation of Jordanians , the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development strives to impact best development practices at the national level , drawing on its experience and local presence , while creating opportunities and expanding the choices of Jordanians to play a central role in the process of shaping the countrys future . 
Whether initiating or sponsoring research , training and education on the United Nations and United Nations reform , on the Great Lakes region of Africa , on early conflict warning and prevention , on disarmament , the status of women , racism and racial discrimination , human rights and sustainable development and environmental protection , WFUNA remains committed to examining the critical issues before the United Nations and to help find solutions that will shape our common future .  
Among the substantive issues discussed , the following warrant special note : identification of the items to be considered ; how to ensure observance of existing international standards ; activities to be undertaken ; appraisal of progress achieved and obstacles met in eliminating racism ; measures for making United Nations mechanisms more effective ; and , lastly , proposals for securing the necessary human and financial resources .  
The international community has repeatedly condemned the harmful impact of such measures on trade relations among States and on the full realization and enjoyment of human rights , in particular the right to enjoy a standard of living adequate for health and well-being , including food , health care , housing and basic social services , and the right to development .  
When the shell hits its target , normally a tank or an armoured car , it emits chemical and radioactive dust containing carcinogenic ionized atoms ( alpha-gamma ) that not only contaminates the area around the incinerated tank but is carried great distances on the wind and spread over a wide area , contaminating the air , soil , vegetation and human beings .  
Important related developments during the past year are presently reviewed , encompassing national electoral processes , public security , human rights , human development , the impact of Hurricane Mitch , regional and extraregional trade and cooperation , the role of regional and hemispheric institutions and bilateral issues .  
It is hoped that the crucial independence of this institution in the countries where it is present and of other institutions responsible for ensuring public accountability of government actions will be strengthened and protected so that they might perform their fundamental role of protecting human rights and as a pillar of citizen confidence in Government .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities among their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
The resulting Antigua Declaration , adopted on 11 March , recognizes the impact of Hurricane Mitch and , in supporting the reconstruction and transformation initiative , reaffirms shared values of democracy , the free market , respect for human rights and fundamental liberties , the rule of law , the struggle against international crime and a commitment to environmental protection .  
It is hoped that these institutions , in conjunction with the National Civil Police , the judiciary and other State institutions and government ministries responsible for public security , will provide an increasingly consolidated institutional framework for addressing criminal activity while guaranteeing permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law , in accordance with the spirit of the peace accords , and building upon the foundation of earlier achievements .  
The specific recommendations formulated by the Commission are directed at promoting the implementation of the peace accords , encouraging peace and national harmony in Guatemala and , in particular , preserving the memory of the victims , fostering a culture of mutual respect and observance of human rights and strengthening the democratic process .  
In this regard , it is also my profound hope that the alarming levels of social and criminal violence will continue to be addressed by Governments through strengthened civilian police , more efficient judicial systems , independent ombudsmen and permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law .  
The UNDP policy document entitled Integrating human rights with sustainable human development embraces a holistic vision integrating all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
A policy framework that integrates macroeconomic , financial , structural , social and human issues is imperative if there is to be equitable and sustainable development .  
Resources should be allocated to basic priority human concerns , for example , moving away from military towards social spending and shifting the focus to better education , health services and safe water accessible to people living with poverty .  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
This approach recognizes the inherent dignity of every human being without distinction ; recognizes and promotes equality between men and women ; promotes participation as a key principle for governance and development planning ; promotes equal opportunities and choices for all so that everyone can develop his or her own unique potential and have a chance to contribute to development and social progress .  
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
This group of nations with different traditions , cultures and historical experiences was brought together by a shared commitment to democracy and a belief that the promise of economic prosperity enjoyed by all citizens is more likely to be realized in a democratic political environment based on respect of human rights , popular participation and the rule of law . 
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
This silence is alarming inasmuch as there are situations in which a countrys press reports in abundant detail on the presence of companies involved in matters of national security and public safety without regard for human rights and in open contradiction with constitutional provisions that categorically state that internal order and security are the exclusive responsibility of the State .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
To close the income and technological gap between the region and the rest of the world requires a more comprehensive approach , including effective public and private investments in industrial infrastructure , strengthening of technological capabilities through human resource development , institution-building and effective economic governance .  
Member States are encouraged to continue supporting the efforts of the Office in this area and to provide additional financial resources as part of their contributions to the programme of advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights , to enable the Office to further extend its activities in support of Member States that request assistance in establishing national institutions and also to support such institutions in their work .  
Full realization of the rights of all peoples , including those living under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , to self-determination enshrined in the Charter and embodied in the international covenants on human rights , as well as in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 ( XV ) of 14 December 1960 ;  
GOOS aims to meet the need for : ( a ) forecasting climate variability and change ; ( b ) assessing the state of health of the marine environment and its resources ( including the coastal zone ) ; and ( c ) supporting an improved decision-making and management process which takes into account potential natural and man-made changes in the environment and their effects on human health and resources .  
Female infanticide was addressed in the Commissions resolution 1999 / 80 , on the rights of the child , with States being called upon to eliminate the root causes of son preference which resulted in harmful and unethical practices , and to eradicate traditional or customary practices , particularly female genital mutilation , that were harmful to women and girls and that violated their human rights .  
UNFPA continued to address harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage because of their impact on womens reproductive and sexual health and as violations of womens fundamental human rights .  
At the second Consultative Group Meeting for the Reconstruction and Transformation of Central America , co-hosted by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Government of Sweden and held in Stockholm , from 25 to 28 May 1999 , the Governments of the region , the principal donors and civil society representatives renewed their commitment to democratic change and sustainable human development as the best means of reducing social and ecological vulnerability to future disasters .  
Across the region , there are indications of a growing gap in human development between zones of relative affluence in the capitals and principal cities and the extreme poverty of marginalized rural and urban areas .  There are related patterns of social inequality and exclusion between social groups , reflected in regional data on distribution of income and access to employment , health and education .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities between their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
In Guatemala and Honduras , the Government of Sweden has approved multi-year governance programmes with UNDP worth over US $ 50-million , aimed at supporting the creation and strengthening of new democratic institutions , including human rights institutions , the courts , public defenders offices and other governmental and non-governmental institutions working for restoration of the rule of law , increased access to justice and respect for human rights .  
The specific recommendations formulated by the Commission are directed at encouraging peace and national harmony in Guatemala and , in particular , at preserving the memory of the victims , fostering the culture of mutual respect and observance of human rights and strengthening the democratic process .  
The representative further stated that it would be a great misfortune for the defenders of human rights if a precedent was set whereby any non-governmental organization involved in a technical-procedural error was to be punished unduly on the basis of one specific case .  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , and stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility ,  
The broad human rights approach to disability , therefore , takes the view of advancing the rights and well being of all people , regardless of disabilities , through promotion of implementation of general and disability-specific international instruments that encompass civil and political to economic , social and cultural rights for all .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
My Office is more than willing to play its part in implementing the report 's constructive recommendations on the effective implementation of international human rights , humanitarian and refugee law and on the prevention of gross violations of human right so crucial to national and regional stability and thus to international peace and security .  
This is true both because of the increased demand that we do something when gross and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law occur , and also because the new international security environment makes it more feasible to do so .  
In collecting information during the four visits for the preparation of the present report , meetings were held with a wide range of personalities from various sectors of Rwandan society : branches of the Government , civil society , members of diplomatic missions and members of United Nations agencies , as well as with some national and international non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) involved in human rights and related matters in Rwanda .  
The public round table is organized to facilitate a wide and rich exchange of experience and expertise from outstanding personalities invited from other similar , but older , national institutions charged with the function of protecting and promoting human rights .  
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .  
Distressed by the widespread violation of the principle of non-refoulement and of the rights of refugees and recalling that asylum applicants should have access to fair and expeditious status-determination procedures , the Assembly encouraged States that had not already done so to consider acceding to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and to other relevant refugee instruments , as applicable , and to relevant international human rights instruments .  
The United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone reported horrifying violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including the wilful killing and torture or inhuman treatment of persons taking no active part in the hostilities .  
She also condemned the grave human rights violations suffered by Serbs , Roma and others , expressing deep concern over the mass exodus of 150,000 Serbs from Kosovo , who join more than half a-million Serb refugees in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina enduring deprivation and an uncertain future in Serbia .  
The seminar produced guidelines that recognize that forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human rights and can only be carried out under exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with relevant provisions of international human rights law .  
The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) acts with its partners in the international community to assist in meeting the operational challenges of migration , advance understanding of migration issues , encourage social and economic development through migration , and uphold the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  IOM is involved in all phases of mass exoduses , providing technical and operational expertise in such areas as transportation , health , and other services for migrants .  
IRIN updates and alerts , covering a wide range of humanitarian , human rights , political , economic and social issues , are drawn from an extensive network of United Nations and other sources , ranging from Governments , international organizations , academic institutions and think-tanks in capital cities to non-governmental organizations , religious missions and private enterprise .  
OCHA is mandated to mobilize and coordinate the collective efforts of the international community , in particular those of the United Nations system , to meet in a coherent and timely manner the needs of those exposed to human suffering and material destruction in disasters and emergencies .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
Calls on States which have not already done so to consider ratifying the major instruments of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law , and to take appropriate legislative , judicial and administrative measures to implement these instruments domestically , drawing on technical assistance , as appropriate , from relevant international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations bodies ;  
It is truly regrettable that , despite quite a number of basic instruments in international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law which provide for the essential legal protection of civilians in armed conflict , the gross violations of their rights around the world have not yet ceased .  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,

The two human rights workers were arrested in December 1998 in connection with a popular protest , which turned violent , against the secret import and dumping by local authorities of industrial toxic waste .  They were accused of leading an unlawful demonstration and incitement to violence .  
Strengthening of the legislative process through assistance with the drafting of legislation and the encouragement of dialogue with civil society to promote informed debate on public policy matters with human rights implications , especially in the domains of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
During his stay in Haiti , the independent expert observed multiple human rights violations throughout the judicial system , which is supposed to be the principal guarantor of such rights .  
These problems , which are linked to the inefficient functioning of the criminal justice system , are compounded by the lack of human resources , the dilapidated state of the courts , and the lack of means of communication , electricity , vehicles and office supplies , and in some cases of codes of judicial procedure .  
The independent expert is closely associated with the implementation of this component , particularly since he shares the MICIVIH approach of according absolute priority to strengthening the network of local NGOs engaged in protecting human rights , a priority which is all the more justified because , to the great regret of the independent expert , the mandate of MICIVIH could not be renewed . 
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , and stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility ,  
They believe that respect , protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms contribute to political and social stability and peace , to the enrichment of the cultural and spiritual heritage of society as a whole and to mutual understanding and friendly relations between their peoples .  
The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the immutable values of peace , democracy and the rule of law , of human rights , development and social justice , and bearing in mind the sovereign equality of States , the non-interference in their internal affairs and the respect for their territorial integrity .  
The only solution to this dilemma , therefore , is to further develop the existing United Nations system in such a way that in the future it is able to intervene in good time in cases of very grave human rights violations , but not until all means of settling conflicts peacefully have been exhausted and this is a crucial point within a strictly limited legal and controlled framework .  
I support the proposal put forward by Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a global pact on common values and principles be concluded within the framework of a public / private partnership , between the United Nations and major companies , in order to lend the law of the market a human face .  
We believe that it is the sacred duty of all Governments to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that all countries have an obligation to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of their own peoples in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and international human rights instruments , and in the light of their respective national conditions and relevant laws .  
The international community now takes military action to deal with tragedies that only a few years ago would have left us indifferent , and yet we are still influenced by military assessments , strategic interests , regional solidarity , public opinion and the magnitude of any human rights violations .  
San Marino intends to continue to voice its protest against capital punishment , firmly convinced that the abhorrent instrument of death consciously and legally inflicted by one human being on another can be considered neither a valid and effective answer to defend society nor a deterrent against the spreading of criminality .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
In this connection , the recommendation of the representative of the Holy See , made during the preparatory process to the Conference against Racism , is very sound : There is a need to go deeper than historical , cultural , political or social contexts and to identify and understand the spiritual and moral dimensions which underlay the universal human condition and in particular those aspects of it leading to abuses of racial discrimination .  
The Albanian State expects that in the near future the Balkans will become a democratic region with an economy intended to reach the level of those of the developed countries , a region that respects human rights , in accordance with advanced European and global standards .  
Nigeria and indeed the entire West African subregion have devoted considerable human , material , political and diplomatic resources to the resolution of these crises in the subregion , starting with Liberia and subsequently Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau .  
The armed intervention and the decisive role played by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague , brought to bear in defence of the principles of humanity and human rights , seem to foreshadow a strengthened determination on the part of the international community to enforce respect for the fundamental values of justice and human dignity that inspired the San Francisco Charter .  
We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights , . . . to establish conditions under which justice . . . can be maintained , and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom , . . . have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims .  
Deeply concerned by the human rights situation in East Timor , and in particular reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in East Timor , as well as the situation of displaced persons in East and West Timor and elsewhere in the region ,  
Affirms that all persons who commit or authorize violations of human rights or international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations and that the international community will exert every effort to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice , while affirming that the primary responsibility for bringing perpetrators to justice rests with national judicial systems ;

To this end the Special Rapporteur welcomes the newly-created Stability Pact of the European Union for south-eastern Europe , which outlines a comprehensive approach to the region and promises the States of south-eastern Europe international assistance and eventual integration into European political and economic structures in return for ongoing progress towards democracy , respect for human rights , and regional cooperation .  
This distressing state of affairs is attributable largely to the impunity with which weapons manufacturers and arms exporters transfer small arms and light weapons to corrupt , unscrupulous and undemocratic regimes with track records of human rights violations and to rebel groups and anti-national elements which use these weapons to subject populations to brutal savagery for their own selfish ends . 
My report to the Security Council on the protection of civilians in armed conflict ( S / 1999 / 957 ) , which was considered by the Council in September , contains detailed proposals on the legal and physical protection of civilians to enhance compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights law during armed conflict .  
It was stressed that international efforts to assist refugees and seek solutions to their plight should be equitable and based on human need , regardless of the nationality , race , geographic , political or military importance of the refugee population .  
Indeed , our continent is home to two thirds of the least developed countries and to three quarters of those at a low level of human development , and almost half of its inhabitants live in absolute poverty .  
The third characteristic that contributes to the unique value proposition of the Voluntary Fund is its focus on initiatives that contribute to an architecture of the possibilities of human beings . 40 As noted above , a number of Voluntary Fund-supported initiatives have focused on building leadership , and managerial or technical skills and have thereby empowered persons with disabilities to plan , negotiate and implement practical action .  
Fourth , the United Nations Development Programme must prepare studies on industrial projects for manufacturing basic commodities agricultural and mineral where Africa again would contribute raw materials and human resources , and the international investment firms would provide financing and technical know-how in a fair manner applied to all .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
While we recognize the difficulty in the real world of achieving smart sanctions , we believe that there is a recurring need to minimize the collateral though unintended human suffering , through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and periodic review mechanisms .  
We also urge the developed countries and regional and international development institutions to provide assistance , grants and loans official and unofficial to African countries and to cancel their external debts , especially those of the poorest countries , to help them improve their economic , social and human capacities .  
It is expected that , through this dialogue , innovative ideas will emerge regarding the specific goals that the United Nations should strive to achieve in the forthcoming decades , in particular in the five core areas of its work , namely , development cooperation , economic and social affairs , humanitarian affairs , peace and security , and human rights .  
Given the intrinsic link between human rights and development , the Hearing emphasized the need to promote respect for basic human rights , and noted that the right to development is a fundamental right that must be recognized , acknowledged , upheld and seen as an integral component of human rights .  
Conscious that the ageing of the worlds population represents an unparalleled and urgent policy and programme challenge to Governments , non-governmental organizations and private groups in ensuring that the needs of the aged and their human resource potential are adequately addressed ,  
This Convention sets universal legal norms which are intended to protect children from insufficient care , ill-treatment and exploitation and to ensure their enjoyment of their fundamental human rights , including the right to survival , development and full participation in social , cultural , educational and other activities .  
Strongly condemn the exploitation of our wealth and the wicked destruction of human lives of which the country is a victim by all the foreign armed forces , above all Rwandan and Ugandan , who one day or another will leave us with a country that has been bled dry , exploited , plundered and ruined ;  
Our rich flora and fauna , marine life , mineral wealth and human potential is unparalleled , and this God-given untapped wealth can best be developed not by a single country but by our Mano River Union .  
Gravely concerned by the increasing activities of transnational organized criminal groups and others that profit from smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ;  
The participating countries and Region should be encouraged to pass legislation to criminalize smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , in all its forms and purposes , including as sources of cheap labour , and to cooperate as necessary in the prosecution and penalization of all offenders , especially international organized criminal groups ;  
Strongly deplores the serious breaches of internationally recognized rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and other persons of concern over the past year , and remains particularly preoccupied that systematic violations of human rights , blatant disregard of international humanitarian law , and policies of wholesale expulsions of populations and ethnic cleansing have caused significant displacement both internally and across borders in many regions of the world ;  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;  
Since ideology and determination alone could not secure social development in developing countries , there must be an effort during the special session to strengthen international partnerships with a view to mobilizing the necessary financial assistance , technical know-how and human resources .  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
To involve , among others , public opinion leaders , educators , religious leaders , chiefs , traditional leaders , medical practitioners , womens health and family planning organizations , the arts and the media in publicity campaigns with a view to promoting a collective and individual awareness of the human rights of women and girls and of how harmful traditional or customary practices violate those rights ;  
Recognizing that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , diseases , especially the malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
Reiterating its deep concern over the continuing violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights , particularly discrimination against women and girls , and over the significant rise in the illicit production of opium , and stressing that the capture by the Taliban of the Consulate-General of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist in Mazar-e-Sharif constituted flagrant violations of established international law ,  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;

Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
If it proved possible to reach agreement on a basic text by the twenty-third executive session of the Board in mid-December , then the Conference could be devoted to a major reflection on the experience of development with a view to identifying clear priorities for trade and development based on a practical approach involving such elements as human resource development and technical cooperation .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
While welcoming the recent developments in connection with the enhanced heavily indebted poor country ( HIPC ) initiative arising from the Cologne Summit , faster and deeper debt relief is required in order to enable African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life , and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries , and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .  
As the new millennium dawned , Bolivia hoped that the United Nations might soon be able to proclaim a world free of colonial vestiges , free of oppression and economic , political and social dependency and respectful of democratic values and fundamental human rights .  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility , and calling on all parties to cooperate with investigations into these reports ,  
Firstly , the fourteenth preambular paragraph calls on all parties to cooperate with investigations into reports of systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed in East Timor .  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility , and calling on all parties to cooperate with investigations into these reports ,  
Those constraints included , inter alia , the lack of linkages within and between productive , service and infrastructural sectors , insufficiently developed human resources , shortcomings in production related to technological capability and adaptive research , deficiencies in physical infrastructure and support services , and the inability of LDCs to generate adequate resources to alleviate those constraints .  
Urgent measures were required , therefore , to remedy that situation through , inter alia , the provision of the technical , human and financial resources commensurate with the tasks and responsibilities of the Office of the Special Coordinator , which , even with extremely limited human and financial resources , had accomplished many commendable tasks . 
The representative of the Republic of Korea said that the development of LDCs had been constrained by shortcomings in the physical infrastructure and human resource development , low levels of domestic resources , and poor performance in the agricultural sector .  
For this purpose new course materials were developed ( on the analysis of the effects of international trade policies , using a global model ) , existing material was adapted to distance learning techniques and a new project intended for Portuguese-speaking countries is currently being developed in Brazil and Cape Verde and will be extended to other lusophone countries , with the expertise of consultants specialized in human resources development in those countries .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
In opening the hearing , President de Marco emphasized the close correlation which existed among the three themes , noting that human rights remained an abstract concept for those who were starving and that economic development remained illusive without peace . 
Despite the scope of the challenges facing countries as a result of globalization , he was confident that the phenomenon was a vehicle for positive changes of benefit to humankind as a whole , since they fostered democratic systems of government that respected human dignity and encouraged countries to be responsible members of a more peaceful international community .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
I would like to emphasize that it was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriots and the binational order that led to the division of the island when the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legal Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
His own Government was committed to pursuing economic development within the framework of democratic institutions and human rights and was convinced that democracy was the only path towards fair and equitable development .  
With consistently negative economic growth and development indicators , the African countries needed an international economic and financial climate that promoted fair trade ; increased market access for African products ; stimulated net capital inflows and , above all , gave globalization a human face .  
The recently enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative ( HIPC ) arising from the Cologne Summit is indicative of the faster and deeper debt relief required in order to assist African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
All States , all peace-loving forces and all human rights organizations which place store by the Charter of the United Nations and the international human rights instruments should speak out loud and strong in protest against what is going on in the camp and should request its closure , demanding the urgent dispatch of an international commission of inquiry to the camp and determined action to put a halt to abduction and internment operations .  
It agreed on the need for good governance , an efficient administrative and institutional support structure , adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors ( A / 54 / 316 , para .  44 ) .  
Among the social and economic measures and policies aimed at developing its human resources , the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya provided education to all free of charge until completion of the elementary level , free health services , and free social security services for widows , disabled persons and the elderly .  
The recently enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative ( HIPC ) arising from the Cologne Summit is indicative of the faster and deeper debt relief required in order to assist African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
It had banned traditional practices that affected the health of women or violated their human rights , fixed the marriageable age at 18 years and amended the Criminal Code to ensure the protection of the rights of women and children ; and passed a customary and divorce law to provide one standard form of inheritance and to correct injustices suffered by women and children under customary laws .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
The Under-Secretary-General stated that the Department viewed modules as main thematic areas of action and activities , such as peace and security , economic and social development , human rights , humanitarian assistance and environment , while elements were specific documents and public information products that better illustrated those thematic categories .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
In addition , WIPO had established a specific institutional mechanism , the Worldwide Academy , which was dedicated to optimizing the use of intellectual property systems by enhancing human resources development programmes at the national and regional levels .  
Mr . Christian Tomuschat , the Commissions Coordinator , detailed its main conclusions and recommendations the fruit of a year and a half of work on the human rights violations and acts of violence which occurred during the internal armed conflict .  In its conclusions , the Commission stated that at least 83 per cent of the victims were Mayan and attributed institutional responsibility for 93 per cent of the violations to agents of the State , principally members of the army .  
In order to achieve respect for cultural differences within a context of national unity , national reconciliation and democratic coexistence , it is essential to implement a comprehensive , nationwide programme of civic education , for which the necessary human and financial resources must be provided .  
Our presence here is proof of the fact that , astonishing though it may seem , the newly developed media and means of communication can not satisfy the need human beings feel for personal and direct contact in order to establish a dialogue conducive to peace this fact was certainly not lost on the founding fathers of the United Nations system .  
Recognizing that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , diseases , especially the malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
Recognizing further that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , disease , especially malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
The methodology of the report is accountable for another obfuscation : in an effort to scale down their size and significance , the human rights abuses evident in the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium , the ethnic cleansing of Serbs after the aggression and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are immediately referenced to alleged violations of human rights by the Yugoslav side .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the ground of ethnicity ;  
Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in Iraq , which particularly affects certain vulnerable groups , such as children , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert the utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all peoples and nations will enhance cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and cultural background , advance the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and foster stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of training , dissemination and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
The General Assembly , Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
The Minister explained , however , that , while the legislation in force in Cameroon since what was generally known as the Afreedoms session @ of the National Assembly ( 1990 ) guaranteed the basic rights and freedoms enshrined in various international and regional instruments , the task of creating a genuine human rights culture , not only among the forces of law and order but also among the public , still lay ahead . 
Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations system to facilitate the active and constructive involvement of the private sector in the development process , and recognizing the importance of the global compact on human rights , labour , environment , proposed by the Secretary-General on 31 January 1999 at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos , Switzerland ,  
The special sessions strong reinforcement of human rights and the human well-being language of the Programme of Action was particularly welcome , as were the calls for intensified action in implementing the Programme of Action , and the new benchmarks in reproductive and sexual health , access to family planning services , reduced maternal mortality , HIV / AIDS prevention , gender issues and education . 
Turning to the issue of human resources development , he said that ILO considered that there was an urgent need to set in place active labour market policies to help workers cope with the growing problems of job loss and redeployment .  Training and re-training programmes , job search assistance , vocational counselling and access to good labour market information were all essential .  
However , the internal conflict had considerably diminished the pool of financial and human resources required for economic growth , and the underground economy spawned by drug trafficking had caused huge distortions , not only of economic data but also of social indicators .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
In the framework of the ongoing internal armed conflict , serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and large-scale breaches of international humanitarian law have forced a growing number of individuals and entire communities to leave their homes .  
Participants concluded that while the underlying causes of displacement in Colombia are multiple ( the internal armed conflict , land disputes , large-scale development projects , etc . ) , violations of human rights and humanitarian law are most often the immediate cause of displacement .  It was therefore argued that a drastic improvement in respect for human rights in Colombia would be the most effective way to prevent displacement .  
Having concluded that displacement is the result of violations of human rights and humanitarian law , workshop participants went on to discuss how internal displacement is not only the result of armed conflict but a strategy to militarily control disputed areas populated by communities perceived as supporters of the enemy .  
It was noted that favourable conditions for return could only be achieved if the fundamental causes of displacement were addressed and the State fully implemented the multiple recommendations made by the international community in regard to the protection of human rights and humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Considering that serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law are the foremost direct cause of forced displacement in Colombia , the workshop urged the Government of Colombia to comply with the Guiding Principles and with the international recommendations already made to address the situation , in particular by the United Nations and the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly at the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
The new UNSMA Civil Affairs Unit will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
The daunting problems of illegal drugs , the lack of needed humanitarian support , human rights abuses , religious extremism and terrorism will not simply go away unless and until the international community is awakened to their combined effect on the peace and security in the region and beyond and starts paying full attention to the root cause - the civil war and foreign interference in Afghanistan . 
Noting that , as the century draws to a close , the Central American countries have achieved significant progress towards the consolidation of democracy and good governance , the strengthening of civilian Governments , respect for human rights and the rule of law , and the promotion of State and economic reforms , sustainable development and regional integration , reflecting the desire of the Central American peoples to live and prosper in a climate of peace and solidarity ,  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Again stresses the need for the international community to maintain its cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , with the Central American countries and to provide them with the necessary financial resources , in a sustained manner and on soft terms , with a view to promoting effectively sustainable human development and the consolidation of peace , freedom and democracy in the region ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;  
Accordingly , in Syria , there is no basis for any discrimination , exception , restriction or preference on grounds of race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin that would in any way hamper or impede the recognition , enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political , economic , social or cultural fields , in employment or in any other sphere of public life .  
Scientific and technical progress is never used for purposes that are incompatible with the enjoyment of any human rights , including every individual 's right to life , health , liberty of person and privacy .  On the contrary , full support and encouragement is given to every materially and mentally creative innovator through the organization of annual specialized exhibitions for this purpose .  
In paragraph 7 of resolution 1999 / 26 the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
Emphasizes that while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .  
The informative and formative activities of CITE target the general public and some specific strategic groups , namely , social negotiators , entrepreneurs , union workers , legislators serving businesses and syndicates , human resources technicians , public administration functionaries and agents , magistrates , lawyers , teachers and municipal entities .  
Providing expert advice to help improve the quality of justice rendered , supporting judicial reform , helping to revamp the inhumane prison system , improving the human rights conduct of the new police force and facilitating the emergence of new state and civic institutions are essential elements of the Missions activities in the area of institution-building .  
Acutely aware of its ad hoc and temporary nature , the Mission has been pursuing a three-pronged exit strategy : strengthening the state institutions responsible for ensuring respect for human rights , reinforcing the capacity of civil society organizations and the media in the area of human rights monitoring and investigation and developing a body of documents , studies and data on key institutions and human rights issues which have been made public .  
MICIVIH currently has responsibility for providing institutional assistance ( with particular reference to the police , judiciary , the penal system , the Ombudsmans Office and civil society organizations ) , supporting the promotion and protection of human rights and verifying observance of individual rights , fundamental freedoms and due process requirements .  
Each State was entitled to protect its citizens and the human rights of the victims of the most serious crimes as it saw fit , and depending on its social , moral , cultural , legal and economic specificities .  
Recent calls for such reform were born of a political desire to protect human rights in the context of international consensus , rather than through the unilateral imposition of a single cultural model .  
In the field of operational activities , considerable progress had been made during the triennial policy review towards formalizing the view that human centred development included economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
With regard to classification , his Governments views were very close to those of UNDP , which had set out seven main categories of threat to human security : economic , food , health , environmental , personal , community and political .  
In spite of its economic , geopolitical and developmental constraints , the Jordanian Government continued to review the human rights guarantees provided through its legal , judicial and administrative systems .  
His delegation reaffirmed its full support for the principles of objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity and its belief that since human rights were indivisible and interdependent , equal importance must be devoted to economic and socio-cultural rights and to civil and political rights .  
The peace process would , however , be stalled so long as Israel continued to violate the rules of international law and international humanitarian law as well as the relevant resolutions of the United Nations . Respect for the provisions of those instruments was a prerequisite to progress in the peace process and to true improvement in the living conditions of the Palestinian people and the human rights situation . 
The report showed that the human rights situation in the occupied territories had remained very much the same as in previous years : the Israeli authorities were continuing to pursue their repressive practices , with a heavy psychological impact on the Arabs living under Israeli occupation .  
Despite that welcome development , the Israeli Government was continuing its policy of establishing Jewish settlements and confiscating Palestinian land , especially in East Jerusalem , in the area around Jerusalem , and in the Syrian Golan , and was still engaging in practices that adversely affected the human rights of the Palestinian people , with the result that in Jerusalem , the demographic , legal , cultural and historic situation was being altered .  
In their discussions with the Special Rapporteur , government officials , private individuals and members of non-governmental organizations generally agreed that there had been a gradual change in the attitude of some of the government actors , from the federal to the municipal level , who were now more inclined towards improving the overall human rights performance of public institutions and agencies .  
This political confrontation has effectively pitted local communities against each other , and as a consequence the indigenous population has paid a heavy price in terms of human suffering and remains under the constant threat of renewed violence .  
Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and recalling that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The theme will include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety and legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equal treatment ;  
The proposed missions staffing would be supplemented by international and local experts in the areas of judicial administration , penal law and procedure , constitutional law , juvenile law and legal assistance , human rights and civic education programmes .  
Resources of $ 155,000 are requested for the hiring of international and local consultants with expertise in the fields of judicial administration , penal law and procedure , constitutional law , juvenile law , legal assistance , human rights and civic education programmes .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Urges also the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , provision of basic social services , poverty eradication , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of youth , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation , respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
As a moral and pluralistic society , Indonesia was committed to promoting respect for human rights and taking into account the varied cultural , ethnic and religious composition of the nation , as provided for in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action .  
His delegation was extremely concerned about the unabated racist measures adopted by the Eritrean regime against Ethiopians living both in Eritrea and in the occupied Ethiopian territory , for whom denial of human rights , lack of legal remedies and outright discrimination had become the order of the day .  
Mr . Tekle ( Eritrea ) said that since Ethiopia had begun its systematic violation of the human rights of Eritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin , it had deported close to 70,000 of them on ethnic grounds , confined 2,000 in harsh concentration camps , was responsible for the disappearance of 1,500 more and deprived 15,000 others of both jobs and housing without allowing them to emigrate .  
Civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were mutually reinforcing , and the international community had a responsibility to ensure a holistic approach to the protection of human rights and the elimination of poverty , one of the most urgent human rights challenges .  
Reaffirming its objectives , as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to the present day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
The members of the Subcommittee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all peoples and nations will enhance cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and cultural background , advance the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and foster stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Affirms that globalization is a complex historical process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , and has a direct impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular the right to development , at both the national and the international level ;  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert the utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all enhances cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and understanding of cultural background , advancing the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and fostering stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of training , dissemination and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
The General Assembly , Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights36 proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism , in all its forms and manifestations , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Recognizing also that accountability of individual perpetrators of grave human rights violations is one of the central elements of any effective remedy for victims of human rights violations and a key factor in ensuring a fair and equitable justice system and , ultimately , reconciliation and stability within a State ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for those laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
Bearing in mind all the extraterritorial effects of any unilateral legislative , administrative and economic measures , policies and practices of a coercive nature against the development process and the enhancement of human rights in developing countries , which create obstacles to the full realization of all human rights ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Reaffirms that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
Noting that , as the century draws to a close , the Central American countries have achieved significant progress towards the consolidation of democracy and good governance , the strengthening of civilian Governments , respect for human rights and the rule of law , and the promotion of State and economic reforms , sustainable development and regional integration , reflecting the desire of the Central American peoples to live and prosper in a climate of peace and solidarity ,  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Noting with concern the resulting exacerbation of the enormous suffering of the Afghan people , resulting in the massive loss of human life , summary executions , the deliberate abuse and arbitrary detention of civilians , refugee flows , the use of child soldiers , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive destruction ,  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
Reaffirming the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations , which , inter alia , call for collective effort to strengthen friendly relations among nations , remove threats to peace and foster international cooperation in resolving international issues of economic , social , cultural and humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
The Declaration defines basic learning needs as : essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy , and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values , and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions , and to continue learning ( art .  1 ) .  
The positions identified for the three mutually reinforcing and complementary ( integrated ) pillars of justice , police and human rights , as well as for the Office of the Representative of the Secretary-General , exclusive of the Administration , are considered the minimum necessary for the satisfactory performance of the Mission .  
The economic sanctions that the Security Council imposes on a number of countries , usually developing countries , and unilateral coercive measures are significant factors that halt the realization of the right to development , cause material and human losses in the development process and require many years to offset , particularly if such economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council continue for a long and indefinite period of time .  
New Zealand is firmly committed to the universality and indivisibility of human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
The advantage of applying existing international human rights law lies in its comprehensive delineation of the prohibited grounds of discrimination and the corresponding governmental obligations which , in the case of racial and gender discrimination , envisage structural alongside individual measures for the elimination of discrimination .  
With reference to the national experience , the Government highlighted the negative consequences of terrorist violence which constituted flagrant violations of human rights , disturbing peace , posing serious threats to public security and leading to more poverty and underdevelopment .  
In the resolution , the Commission condemned the widespread , systematic and gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in East Timor , including widespread violations and abuses of the right to life , personal security , physical integrity and the right to property .  
In response to increasing reports of violence and human rights abuses attributed to Indonesian government forces since the beginning of the year , the Special Rapporteur had repeatedly sent urgent appeals to the Government urging the authorities to protect the safety and integrity of the civilian population in East Timor and to ensure that the police and military were conducting their operations in strict compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law standards . 
In accordance with current procedures , the Advisory Committee expects that full justification for the requirements of all support account posts will be provided in the context of the comprehensive annual proposals on the total requirement for human and financial resources from all sources of funding for all departments involved in the backstopping of peacekeeping operations to be submitted to the General Assembly , through the Advisory Committee , in spring 2000 .  
The UNSMA Civil Affairs Unit , established in 1999 , will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission , was revised to read :  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Calls upon the Government of Haiti to continue structural reforms in the police and the judicial system and the improvement of the prison sector , to investigate properly politically motivated crimes and prosecute perpetrators of such crimes in accordance with Haitian law , to take vigorous action to eliminate any continuing human rights violations , including illegal arrests and detentions , and to ensure due process within a reasonable time ;  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and continuing serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continued coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross purposes ;  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Under the authority of the national committee on the use of illicit drugs , the relevant national institutions had focused their activities on human resource development , scientific research , periodic evaluation and the provision of services to the most vulnerable sectors of society , including young people .  
While the military authorities and police had improved their methods and capabilities for combating drug trafficking by acquiring greater logistical , financial and human resources , international cooperation still remained essential , since it enabled the States concerned to exchange reliable information and advanced technologies .  
In accordance with the rules governing international responsibility , we affirm the legally established right of the Republic of Iraq to seek compensation for all the losses , in terms of human , material and moral damage , that have been sustained by Iraq and its people owing to acts of aggression that are contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
There is generally some tension between human rights and the effectiveness of criminal justice systems because the rights of criminal suspects are often protected by imposing substantive or procedural requirements on police and prosecutors , supported by some form of remedy for the suspect whose rights are infringed upon .  
The Board is composed of five persons with relevant experience in the field of human rights and contemporary forms of slavery in particular , who serve in their personal capacity , as United Nations experts and are appointed by the Secretary-General for a three-year renewable term , in consultation with the current Chairman of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights , with due regard to equitable geographical distribution . 
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , including through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law have been prepared by a Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , appendix ) and deserve close scrutiny by the international criminal justice community . 
While the conceptualization of national and other more specific benchmarks has generated a great deal of discussion within the human rights community , the setting of progressive development benchmarks has been a natural outcome of the follow-up to international commitments made to implement the education goals of successive world conferences and global summits organized by the United Nations since 1990 . 
The violation of human dignity and physical integrity which torture and , in its lesser form , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment constitute , is a symptom of a malfunctioning social order .  
Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations system to facilitate the active and constructive involvement of the private sector in the development process , and recognizing the importance of the global compact on human rights , labour , environment , proposed by the Secretary-General on 31 January 1999 at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos , Switzerland ,  
However , it needed a human face , a people-centred approach based on improving the standard of living for all : poverty must be eradicated , peoples basic needs must be fulfilled and human rights must be promoted , with special attention to the status of women , children and disadvantaged groups . 
At a time of rapid and tumultuous global change , if UNDP can leverage this precious asset into a more effective role in helping countries to meet their development challenges , it will have a remarkable impact on human development and poverty eradication .  
The special session had adopted by consensus a document that identified key measures for the further implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action ( A / S-21 / 5 / Add . 1 ) , which validated the comprehensive approach to population and development issues and provided a set of new interim benchmarks for achievement of the goals of the Conference and reduction of vulnerability to human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) .  
Safety and security are basic human rights and essential to economic development , therefore it is imperative that scarce resources be invested in programmes likely to protect such rights in a responsible and sustainable way .  
We have always said that Iraq is a great country with a rich cultural heritage , home to one of the oldest civilizations known , and that , by virtue of its abundant natural , mineral , human and other resources , it has huge potential to become an economic force to be reckoned with , not only in the Gulf region but also worldwide .  
It has also noted the inability of the judicial system and of the auxiliary bodies responsible for investigations to determine criminal , civil and administrative responsibility in respect of crimes with high social impact and serious human rights violations .  
The Government of Cyprus was committed to pursuing all possible steps to ensure that women had full enjoyment of their basic human rights and were equal partners in shaping the economic , political and social life of the country .  
His delegation believed that the social sector should be given high priority in the development process , since no economic development programme could be meaningful if it did not endeavour to eliminate hunger and illiteracy , provide adequate health services , improve the quality of life , and give due attention to human values .  22 .  The Government of Eritreas economic and social policies were based on the conviction that , to be successful , development must emphasize social development .  
The Working Group was informed by several non-governmental organizations that members of the armed and security forces accused of having committed enforced or involuntary disappearances and other grave human rights violations in previous decades had not been brought to court .  
While we fully understand the desire of the Member States and the Secretariat of the United Nations to save funds by reducing the number and the size of its documents , it has been always recognized that this general 32-page limit can not be applied to thematic mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights , the annual reports of which should adequately reflect the situation of gross and systematic human rights violations on a country-by-country basis throughout the world .  
The Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments are all based on the fundamental principle of non-discrimination : everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in these instruments , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , birth or status .  
The Fourth World Conference on Women reaffirmed that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and established a number of specific strategic objectives to ensure that women enjoy their full human rights .  
All training activities carried out under the OHCHR technical cooperation programme continue to include sessions on the human rights of women , with a specific focus on concerns relevant to each professional group addressed by the training - judges , police officers , members of non-governmental organizations , government officials , military , peacekeeping personnel , human rights monitors and others .  
States were to be encouraged to adopt administrative , legislative and judicial measures so as to give effect to human rights guarantees and , in this regard , the Government reiterated its determination to enforce responsibility for violations of human rights , which constituted an essential element and a key factor in the definitive establishment of justice and national reconciliation within a State . 
The Government of Cyprus explained the existing administrative , legislative and other measures for combating impunity for human rights violations contained in its laws , in particular Part II of its Constitution which incorporates verbatim pertinent provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights , which Cyprus has ratified .  
However , to these categories there ought to be added a fourth : man-conceived disasters , including genocide , mass deportations , the use of death camps , ethnic cleansing , enforced or involuntary disappearances and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Promotes the sharing and transfer of experience through the monitoring of human settlements indicators and learning from best practices in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels and feeds back the lessons learned and experiences gained in improving human settlements conditions at the country level into global policy development processes ;  
The Nordic countries and Poland , in their responses , agreed that there was a need to address any lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , which fell outside the scope of common article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II thereto , and when effective implementation of human rights might be limited by derogations in exceptional circumstances .  
In this connection , Poland , Switzerland and the National Womens Council of Catalonia stated that fundamental standards were intended to ensure the effective protection of human beings in all situations , especially during situations of internal violence when some of the most horrible atrocities are committed , both by Governments and by non-State actors .  
In order to address that lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , of which five major situations had been identified , it would be useful to identify and draw upon international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , applicable at all times , to all circumstances and to all actors , both governmental and non-governmental , as well as any individual .  
The third issue raised by ICRC concerned the proposal of the Secretary-General that further analysis would be needed to identify the extent to which the human rights abuses which are most prevalent in situations of internal violence can be attributed to the proper and faithful application of derogation clauses set out in international treaties .  
The primary question that should be answered was whether existing and future mechanisms of international criminal responsibility obviated the need for an elaboration of f " undamental standards of humanity " , given that non-State actors could be held criminally responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and human rights crimes .  
ICRC suggested that many purposes could be envisaged : a document meant to facilitate the dissemination of the relevant norms , an instrument aimed at clarifying the substance of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflict , a text aimed at clarifying the responsibility of non-State actors , or a document aimed at bridging the gap ( if one existed ) between international humanitarian law and human rights law in situations of internal violence .  
By compiling and analysing the norms reflected in international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , a global framework of fundamental standards could be elaborated , protecting the individual at all times and in all circumstances .  
According to Turkey , the content of fundamental standards of humanity should be limited to international human rights law and not include international humanitarian law , as they concerned situations of internal violence which did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict .  
Specialized services established in order to contribute to protecting human life included medical and civil defence services , as well as special legal mechanisms to ensure respect for the rules of humanitarian law .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
The Commission also requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider the possibility of holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
Significantly , the Genocide Convention makes individuals liable to prosecution whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers , public officials or private individuals and it envisages the establishment of international mechanisms to enforce individual criminal responsibility for major human rights violations .  
With the recent resurgence of old ethnic , racial and nationalist antagonisms in various forms of intolerance , xenophobia and , in the most extreme cases , ethnic conflict , ethnic cleansing and genocide , United Nations human rights mechanisms are compelled to reflect on situations where the occurrence of racist acts and racial discrimination could degenerate into open conflict , and recommend timely specific and adequate preventive measures .  
Although ethnic conflicts may be considered autonomous and disparate , these conflicts pose a real threat to international security and generate many forms of human rights violations which must be addressed .  
Responses to situations of such conflicts designed to reduce tensions and violence based on ethnic , racial or xenophobic conflicts may include : preventive diplomacy ; early-warning mechanisms ; mediation ; promotion of tolerance through human rights education ; support to democratic institutions through better representation of all segments of the society ; affirmative action ; promotion of multiculturalism .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ( Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter ) .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development ( Agenda for Development ( General Assembly resolution 51 / 240 , annex ) , para . 
The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
Over the last 50 years , and especially since the end of the cold war , the decrease in the number of international armed conflicts has been offset by an increase in the number of civil wars and other situations of internal violence , which are characterized by massive and systematic violations of human rights .  
Human rights education can promote a change in negative attitudes or reinforce positive attitudes and behaviour so that the need and the importance of protecting and promoting human rights in the course of ones daily life and professional duties are deeply understood and assumed .  
The universal implementation of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political , is the surest preventive strategy and the most effective way of avoiding the emergence of conflict .  
The excesses of the so-called military justice , a regular cause of arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights violations , as demonstrated by cases brought before the Working Group , have prompted the Group , in its recommendations in previous reports , to underline the need for an international conference to analyse the subject and seek to limit the actual powers of the military justice system ;  
The Working Group had concentrated on five main issues , identified in 1994 , and had produced a valuable study , together with a short background paper attached as an appendix , dealing with the existence or non-existence of jurisdictional immunity in actions arising out of violations of jus cogens norms , particularly acts of a State in violation of human rights norms having the character of jus cogens .  
The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
The areas identified are education , sustainable economic and social development , human rights , equality between women and men , democratic participation , advancing understanding , tolerance and solidarity , participatory communications and free flow of information , and knowledge and international peace and security .  
We must take a doctrine of peace and make of it a specific discipline accompanied by a carefully prepared programme , in order to develop , with logical rigour and an adequate foundation , an entire body of principles and pronouncements of a scientific , ethical and pragmatic nature in the service of the categorical human imperative for peace .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of both civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights .  
It acknowledged the inherent complementarity between the refugee-specific mandate of UNHCR and the broader human rights mandates of other concerned agencies and institutions and asserted the need to maintain the mutually supportive but separate character of their respective mandates .  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;  
In the weeks that followed , members of ethnic minority groups , especially Roma and Serbs , began fleeing Kosovo owing to fear of the killings , kidnapping , looting of properties , evictions , widespread burning of villages , as well as cultural , historical and religious monuments , and other forms of intimidation directed against them.The situation of the Serb , Roma and other minority communities has been a painful one of widespread human rights violations . 
The Office will start consultations with African States in the near future on developing a framework for regional human rights cooperation in Africa that would be based on continued support by the Office to OAU regional and subregional initiatives , as well as on activities at the national level in the four areas referred to above .  
The liberalization of international trade , production and financial transactions , the increasing influence of global corporations and developments in information technology and communications all components of the globalization process are increasingly being considered from the perspective of their individual and collective impact on respect for human rights .  
At the regional and subregional levels , the Office is undertaking a number of initiatives , including a joint project with the Council of Europe focusing on preventive activities for Central and Eastern Europe ; a range of activities in the former Yugoslavia coordinated by the human rights office in Sarajevo ; and a joint project with UNDP in Nepal focusing on the legal and judicial aspects of controlling trafficking .  
Less visible but nonetheless destructive violations of human rights are the growth of poverty in rich and developing countries alike , and the marginalization caused by violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The strong plea of the High Commission is : let us , in the coming century , prevent gross violations of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights .  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
In addition , the programme , through greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on more efficient methods to prevent human rights violations and remove obstacles to the full realization of human rights . 
The Republic of China a democratic country concerned with safeguarding and promoting human rights , a world economic Power recognized by nations , and , last but not least , a nation that maintains trade relations through commercial delegations shares with deep conviction our common faith in the noble ideals of peace , solidarity and cooperation enshrined in the Charter .  
The suit demands that the United States Government , which is responsible for these human losses and injuries , be sentenced to pay a total of $ 181.1-billion in reparation as a minimum symbolic compensation for the loss of something that is clearly irreplaceable and priceless : the lives and physical well-being of the more than 5 , 500 Cuban citizens who have been victims of the United States obsessive policy against Cuba .  
Because of this situation , the world has witnessed a series of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led to the emergence of many areas of political and military conflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in the human , economic and social conditions of many regions in the world .  
Yet this is only one of the many purposes of our Organization ; to achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is no less an important goal in our Charter .  
In a sense , our endeavour to define and , indeed , to promote human security has philosophical and practical implications both positive and negative for us as sovereign States and for the United Nations as the leading global multilateral Organization .  
As a result , Bahrain has been able to build an open and developed economy that has made it possible for the country to realize comprehensive and sustainable human development , as reflected in its remarkable ranking in the human development index for five consecutive years .  
These include the shelter , management and social reintegration of tens of thousands of displaced persons , a humanitarian tragedy whose scale has not always been clearly perceived by the international community ; the protection of people and property ; the respect of human rights ; and the restoration of normal living conditions in many war-torn communities an overwhelming task that anyone would agree requires means exceeding by far the capacities of a State bled dry such as Congo is today .  
We see , on the one hand , astounding developments in many fields of human endeavour and , on the other , national and international conflicts , resulting in mass destruction of human life and infrastructure as well as the almost irreversible compromising of the ecological system .  
Our new system is clearly seriously flawed when a dispute between two powerful transatlantic partners can be settled in a political vacuum which totally ignores the very real and disastrous consequences it will inevitably unleash on the economies of a fragile group of small States . This is certainly not globalization with a human face . 
I am confident that over the next two days the debate will be characterized by new ideas and a renewed commitment to the Proclamation on Ageing , which calls for the recognition of humanity ' s demographic coming of age and the promise it holds for maturing attitudes and innovations in political , legal , social , economic , cultural and spiritual fields as our collective and determined way of preparing ourselves towards social justice , global peace , human development equality in the next century . 
The peaceful advancement of the human family and the security of its livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , external debt burden , growing technological and economic gaps between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases .  
In conclusion , may I express my delegation ' s sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Summit will help generate the renewed political will at the national and international levels that is so needed to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
In the years to come , for economies with a relative average development , the subject of employment , which was included as a commitment in Copenhagen , will be essential to overcoming the link between poverty , low productivity and insufficient levels of skilled human capital .  
My country is fully convinced that States play a great role in activating social development at the local level and in creating an enabling environment , thus implementing the Copenhagen commitments by placing social development on a strong foundation of human rights , non-discrimination , pursuit of equal opportunities and the realization of social justice .  
Improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , through international assistance for the purpose of capacity-building and human resource development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , is also necessary for the successful implementation of national programmes .  
Many specific aspects of such a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention are addressed in the General Assembly : social cohesion , the eradication of poverty , the protection of minorities and human rights , democratic governance , peacekeeping and the rule of law in internal and international relations .  
He did not give us a descriptive report , but one based on his prerogatives , responsibilities and discretionary powers , putting forward a vision and initiatives to confront what he views as threats to international peace and security and ideas on how the United Nations could respond to political , humanitarian and human rights crises .  
In the context of legislative and legal guarantees and taking into account the balance between the needs of the individual and those of society , my country has adopted several political , social and economic measures aimed at the maximum utilization of human resources and the improvement of living standards .  
All this has had a positive effect on the quality of life in Libyan society , as has the provision of all basic social services , despite the coercive economic sanctions that have been imposed on the people of Libya in 1990 s , caused serious human and material damage and hampered programmes and plans devoted to social development .  
This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .  
I wish to reiterate the commitment of the Kingdom of Swaziland to this process , which is aimed at meeting the challenges faced by our countries and our Organization in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting , as well as encouraging , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as mapped out in the Charter of the United Nations .  
If the political manipulation of human rights continues the selectivity , partiality and double standards ; if economic and social rights are ignored ; if the right to development is disregarded ; if a sectarian and abstract international human rights law is imposed ; and if all human rights are not guaranteed for all human beings conflicts will continue .  
In our view , the only worthwhile approach to this problem encompasses human rights in a comprehensive , integrated and indivisible way : all human rights , which is to say the basic economic , cultural and social needs of every individual , along with civil and political rights .  
These are , at the political level , the quest for peace with a view to bringing about a better and more united world ; at the economic level , the promotion of genuine development for the benefit of all countries and all peoples , which is a sine qua non condition for the establishment of the true collective security to which we all aspire ; and , at the social level , human freedom through the promotion of human security . 
Norway fully supports the cooperation between the OIC and the United Nations in their common search for solutions to global problems related to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic , social and technical development .  
Paragraph 3 requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
The ensuing concentration of power and influence lies in the hands of those nations , institutions and individuals that can master the wealth of information on all aspects of human interaction , be it economic , financial , political , social or cultural .  
But it counts it a continuing and profound privilege to join with the members of this General Assembly to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small , and to endeavour to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained .  
Hence , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the values of peace , democracy , rule of law , human rights , development and social justice , bearing in mind the principles of sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for their territorial integrity .  
Recent national and international events marking the day on which the 6 billionth human being was born on planet Earth illustrated that the international community is today concerned not merely with numbers but with individual human lives in trying to balance population growth with economic growth .  
The report takes comprehensive stock of the activities carried out and the resolutions adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) as part of its coordinated and effective support for the work of the United Nations in its principal areas of authority , including peace and security , human rights and economic and social development .  
This agreement , based on the promotion of international cooperation and the solution of problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , is designed to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
In the context of the process of growing interdependence , even as calls are being made for free access to financial markets , goods , services , it is paradoxical to witness situations in which obstacles to such interaction are erected unilaterally and without regard for their effects upon the human development of a people even more so when we see that those obstacles are erected by applying internal norms with extraterritorial scope or effects that run counter to international public law .  
Let me refer to the European Union Common Position of 2 December 1996 , and reiterate on this occasion that the main objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of gradual and peaceful transition to pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
The results of the discussions held in The Hague and St . Petersburg not only significantly advanced the themes of the first Peace Conference , but also helped energize a vital global debate on the role of the United Nations in preventing conflict and halting gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
In this decade the international legal order has been further developed , a number of new States have emerged , the new role and growing strength of the regional organizations has been confirmed , and strong emphasis has been placed on human rights .  
Despite the result of the referendum last May , it is of the utmost importance that the peace agreements be fully implemented , especially with regard to full respect for human rights , equal opportunities for the indigenous population , reform of the judicial system , fiscal and land reform , and reconciliation based on truth .  
A sustained and determined effort is necessary if the national peace agreements are to be fully implemented , particularly as concerns the fostering and protection of human rights , equal opportunities and judicial , fiscal and agrarian reform .  
In their recent joint declaration , the Presidents of the Central American countries expressed their resolve to undertake coordinated action on such crucial issues as protecting the human rights of migrants , combating drug trafficking and moving forward towards regional economic integration .  
Political , social and economic transformation now present us with a Central America free from armed conflict , a Central America with strengthened democratic institutions and a Central America in which peace , the protection of human rights and regional integration have been established on a solid footing .  
In a world still governed by a narrow realism , sometimes sterile but always destructive , it is clear that those who envisage a better future for humanity will have much to do to definitively set in motion the dynamic of change that is so necessary for sustainable human development .  
This year , as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions and the one hundredth anniversary of the Hague Conventions , armed conflicts in many parts of the world , including the Great Lakes region , Angola , Sierra Leone , East Timor , the Balkans and Caucasia , have given rise to frequent and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
With its unsurpassed costs in terms of human and financial numbers , claiming some 50 , 000 victims and causing economic losses exceeding $ 90-billion throughout the world , 1998 was an annus horribilis , that clearly illustrated the extreme vulnerability of developing countries to natural disasters of all types .  
Today , as we look back , we can see that what we have achieved in Mongolia over the past decade in building the institutions of democracy , promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms , unleashing private initiative and developing our external relations has constituted a major advance towards a self-governing democratic society , a private-sector-led economy and a closer association with the rest of the international community .  
Hence , gaining a growing number of adherents across cultural , social and economic lines , democracy is increasingly being recognized as an appropriate response to a wide range of human concerns , and as an ingredient for both sustainable development and lasting peace .  
At our second Conference , held in Managua in 1994 , we took another important step when we adopted the Managua Declaration and Plan of Action , which addressed issues relating to the political and reconciliation processes within national societies , human rights and the right of all nations to development , economic reforms , structural adjustment programmes and other problems facing democratic States .  
These include free , fair and competitive elections ; separation of powers ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; strengthening the rule of law and the application of practices of good governance and fundamental freedoms ; increasing the participation of civil society in the development of democracy ; creating an economic environment favourable to democracy ; and enhancing social cohesion and solidarity , among others . 
Yet all these efforts have been frustrated by hostile and aggressive actions taken by the occupying Power , which , far from showing itself ready to negotiate , has continued its policy of illegal settlements and violation of international law and human rights of the Arab people who live the bitter reality of living under occupation .  
India is vitally interested in peace , development and stability in the Middle East , a region close to our heart and with which we share bonds of history and culture , reinforced in modern times through multifaceted cooperation encompassing trade , investment , cultural exchanges , technical assistance and human resource development . 
While the United Nations has created a judicial affairs office that deals with the court system , the prosecution service and the correctional system in Kosovo , the OSCE Rule of Law Division which is part of the Rule of Law and Human Rights Department is tasked with developing mechanisms to ensure that the police , courts , administrative structures and other judicial structures are operating in accordance with international standards of criminal justice and human rights .  
Such cooperation must continue to be based on key activities of the international community , first and foremost among which are promoting the prevention and settlement of conflicts , peacekeeping and ensuring the humanitarian aspects of security and development , including respect for human rights and the rights of national minorities , refugees and displaced persons . 
The Fourth Committee welcomed the outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , held in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and it endorsed the practical benefits and potential offered in all areas of human activity by space technology , the peaceful application of which can contribute to increasing the quality of live and to sustainable economic and social development .  
It is for this reason that the ongoing illicit trafficking in and the systematic plundering of its works of art are harmful not only to the countries that own these works of art and archaeological treasures , but also to universal culture and human civilization .  
The European Union can not but remain deeply concerned that grave breaches of humanitarian law and human rights , the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , attacks against humanitarian personnel , the use of child soldiers , ethnic hatred and arms trafficking remain among the key problems of regional and international concern .  
We are committed to working in partnership with Africa to secure peace and democracy , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , political stability and economic and social development .  
We will strengthen the dialogue with the OAU and subregional organizations on concrete possibilities for backing their efforts , inter alia in the fields of early warning , preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and of awareness of the importance of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , the rule of law , a pluralist society , democratic institutions and practices , and a culture of tolerance .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
This fact has always prompted us to restate the principle of full respect for the delicate balance between the major organs of the international Organization as set out in the Charter , in particular the inherent role of the General Assembly in considering principles of cooperation aimed at relieving human suffering , including addressing the causes of conflict and the strengthening of lasting peace and sustainable development .  
Referring to the principle that good governance , transparency and human rights are essential elements for building representative and stable governments and contribute to conflict prevention , it was decided that those Governments that had come to power through unconstitutional means should no longer be expected to be received as equals in an OAU assembly of Heads of State .  
An integral part of promoting sustainable human development is respect for all social and economic rights , as well as cultural , civil and political rights .  
During the debate , the following major points emerged : globalization and the international financial crisis ; the decline of official development assistance and debt-relief initiatives ; good governance ; people-centred development ; poverty eradication ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; basic social services ; and the role of civil society in decision-making , resource allocation , development and human security .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
It is therefore important to increase the attention that is paid to the social components of economic development and to put the human person human dignity , human rights , economic and spiritual potential and , most important , life and health at the centre of national and international policies .  
For several months the world witnessed a war in the Balkans a region of the world that , in economic terms , is relatively prosperous in which the vital social infrastructure and human potential of a sovereign State were deliberately destroyed .  
Iraq was one of the pioneers in adopting organized scientific planning to mobilize and develop human and financial resources so as to achieve sustainable economic growth aimed at bringing about the prosperity of human beings and at maintaining their right to their natural resources and their environmental rights .  
At home and on the international stage , New Zealand has sought to play an active role in the promotion of the human rights of women and to ensure their full participation in society as equal partners with men , in particular supporting and encouraging sexual and reproductive health rights and other rights of women , which are central to the Programme of Action .  
We must take on the often difficult challenge of recognizing and addressing the intimate but complex links between both international and internal migration and other population and development issues.Canada is committed to continuing an active multilateral approach to migration which has as its cornerstone protection of the human rights of all migrants .  
It is the conviction of Malta that it must keep on working on the basis outlined in the Cairo Programme of Action and in accordance with the prevalent ethical and cultural values of Maltese society , as reflected in national legislation , so that , together with the international community , we may promote a decent and fulfilling life for every single human being on our planet and for future generations .  
What we all have in common is the wish and the request of peoples to have a better standard of living than they had in the past , real sustainable development and sustained growth in their countries and for their human rights and freedoms to be fully protected and observed .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
They also take into account our national priorities in such fields as social development strategies for the twenty-first century , health and environment in the context of sustainable development , development of human resources in the field of meteorology , proper management of water resources , integrated environmental management against pollution caused by industrial activity , protection of the atmosphere and the enhancement of the capacity of the States environmental research centre .  
These factors do indeed have a key role to play in terms of successful and sustainable development , and it goes without saying that human and institutional capacities are a prerequisite for addressing environmental , economic and social issues in the decision-making process simultaneously . 
What is particularly noteworthy is that , with the accelerated pace of globalization and ever-fiercer international competition , small island developing States are encountering increasingly grave challenges as a result of serious constraints such as lack of financial , technological and human resources .  
The unfortunate consequences of deterioration in the economic environment , particularly in connection with the global financial crisis , brought , in some cases , a reversal of social gains , while there was an increase in human suffering and deprivation.In the affected countries , the impact of economic adversity was felt at all levels of society , but the poorest segments carry a disproportionate burden .  
Acknowledges that the realization by women of their right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is an integral part of the full realization by them of all human rights , and that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights ;  
Support scientific research into and the development of safe , affordable , effective and easily accessible female-controlled methods of family planning , including dual methods such as microbicides and female condoms that protect against both sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV AIDS ) and prevent pregnancy , taking into account paragraph 96 of the report of the Fourth World Conference on Women ;  
Acknowledges that national machineries are necessary for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action ; and that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources and continued strong political commitment are crucial ;  
Acknowledging that special attention must be given to the mental health needs of women , including those who are marginalized because of , inter alia , race , ethnicity , religion , age , social and economic status , physical and or mental disability , exploitative commercial sex , displacement , migration and human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV AIDS ) ,  
The Working Group expressed its deep concern in relation to the continuing grave violations of womens human rights , including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the persistent and pervasive discrimination against women .  
The Working Group was concerned at the allegations of the violations of the human rights of women , including widespread arbitrary arrest , use of excessive force during arrests , incommunicado detention , prolonged administrative detention , detention of minors , torture and ill-treatment , unfair trial and forcible exile of political opponents and prisoners .  
Representatives emphasized that national machineries , in order to carry out their functions , should be equipped with adequate human and financial resources and be located where they could effectively influence government policy , preferably at a high government level , and where they can be protected from frequent political changes .  
We are confident that the Committee jurisprudence will be open to a developing interpretation of the most controversial points , in the light of the practice of other human rights treaty bodies , and also of the peculiarity of the CEDAW Convention , which provides for a wider scope of social and cultural human rights than other international instruments .  
From the practice of other international human rights treaty bodies , it is evident to the Netherlands delegation that the admissibility criteria contained in article 4 , paragraph 2 , subparagraph iii ( manifestly ill-founded or not sufficiently substantiated ) are concrete illustrations of the general admissibility criterion contained in article 4 , paragraph 2 , subparagraph ii , which provides that a communication should be compatible with the provisions of the Convention .  
We are particularly pleased to note the widely shared view that this optional protocol provides procedures for the enforcement of the human rights of women which are in no way less effective than the procedures available in other human rights instruments ; indeed that its provisions build on those existing instruments and should be interpreted in the light of the rules of procedure and the evolving practice and experience of the other human rights treaty bodies .  
Increase efforts to address the critical issues of fresh water and sanitation in human settlements in developing countries through , inter alia , the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the provision of financial resources for implementation , as elaborated in Agenda 21 , as a priority of the international agenda on sustainable consumption and production ;  
Governments at all levels , the private sector and other major groups as defined in Agenda 21 are urged to cooperate in developing waste collection systems and disposal facilities , and developing programmes for prevention , minimization and recycling of waste , to safeguard and improve the quality of life in human settlements and coastal regions in all countries , especially in developing countries .  
Recognizes that the lack of human , technical or financial resources at national level could be hindering the submission of more voluntary national reports or relevant information ;  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
The purpose of the 1991 revised criteria for least developed country status was to designate those low-income countries that were suffering from a low level of human resources and from structural weaknesses , specifically as reflected in a low degree of economic diversification .  
The Committee is fully aware of the human and material costs of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka and the deleterious effects this has on the economic , social and cultural rights of every person living in the country .  
The Chairperson reiterated his concern about the persistent lack of recognition of economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to education , as human rights , not only at the national level but also in various international entities .  
Referring to the numerous calls by the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for increased collaboration in the field of human rights among United Nations organs , specialized agencies and the various parts of the Secretariat , Mr . Alston stressed the need to build up a genuine partnership aiming at realizing the right to education as embodied in articles 13 and 14 of the Covenant . This applied equally to the various treaty bodies . 
In calling for a renewed commitment to respect economic , social and cultural rights , the Committee wishes to emphasize that international organizations , as well as the Governments that have created and manage them , have a strong and continuous responsibility to take whatever measures they can to assist Governments to act in ways which are compatible with their human rights obligations and to seek to devise policies and programmes which promote respect for those rights .  
The World Conference on Human Rights held in 1993 underscored the interdependence of all human rights , and emphasized that all societies should work to ensure the enjoyment by all their members of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , including their right to development .  
The Convention codifies women ' s right to non _ discrimination and equality with men and also establishes that women and men are equally entitled to the full enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
To that end , they pledge to increase their efforts to assess factors and obstacles that impinge on women ' s enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social , cultural and other rights and to suggest specific actions on how such obstacles might be overcome so that full enjoyment of human rights by all , without discrimination , may be realized .  
The adoption of a rigid classification of economic , social and cultural rights which puts them , by definition , beyond the reach of the courts would thus be arbitrary and incompatible with the principle that the two sets of human rights are indivisible and interdependent .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
He reported that the Centre had reinforced its technical cooperation efforts and refocused its work on the future challenges and mandates that would arise from the convention , especially through its newly launched global programme against corruption , global programme against trafficking in human beings and global studies on transnational organized crime .  
The theme will include : human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment ;  
The theme will include : human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  
Deeply concerned by the human rights situation in East Timor , and in particular reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in East Timor , as well as the situation of displaced persons in East and West Timor and elsewhere in the region ,  
Affirms that all persons who commit or authorize violations of human rights or international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations and that the international community will exert every effort to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice , while affirming that the primary responsibility for bringing perpetrators to justice rests with national judicial systems ;  
The establishment of the permanent forum should have a positive impact on construction and development for indigenous peoples in areas such as economic , political , social and cultural rights , human rights , the environment , health and the expansion of cross _ cultural bilingual education based on the world view of the indigenous peoples in each State .  
Mr . Nebenzia ( Russian Federation ) said that his country attached great importance to international cooperation for the sustainable development of human settlements and the improvement of the social and economic conditions of urban and rural populations.In that context , the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements played a vital role as guarantor of the implementation of the decisions taken at the Habitat II Conference .  
If the Government of a State were to distribute letters in which an ethnic or minority group alleged that it was the victim of repressive measures or that its fundamental human rights were not recognized in the sovereign territory of another State , the Government of Cyprus reserved the right to act in the same way if that practice continued .  
Also bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Expresses its appreciation for the activities carried out by the United Nations system , as well as the observations and recommendations contained in the report , with respect to building a political culture through human rights observance , mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , free and independent media , enhancing the rule of law and improving accountability , transparency and quality of public sector management and democratic structures of government ;  
In terms of programme areas covered by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received larger shares were human resource development , transport and communication , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources , and energy resources .  
To the contrary , tensions have increased in many parts of the world and have intensified human suffering because of a resurgence of the arms race with the attendant death , exodus , ethnic cleansing and famine .  
On that occasion the Heads of State or Government reiterated their concern over the fact that the arms race absorbs a major proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources in today ' s world , imposes a heavy burden on the economies of all countries , in particular developing countries , and affects international trade and financial and technological flows .  
Similarly , at the national level , there was a growing awareness that sustainable development , as well as the prevention and peaceful settlement of most contemporary conflicts , depended on effective guarantees of human rights .  
The universal ratification of the six core human rights treaties , including the optional protocols thereto , within the next five years , would not only serve as a decisive step towards a shared international legal commitment to the implementation of all human rights but would also symbolize the international communitys willingness to work in a true spirit of partnership to reach common goals .  
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action emphasized that all human rights were universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis . 
While supporting the principle that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights lay with States , his delegation wished to underline in that regard that initiatives aimed at undermining the territorial integrity or political unity of independent and sovereign States must not be encouraged .  
Also , within the context of the modernization of the legal system , several government committees were working with governmental organizations which played a leading role in promoting and strengthening respect for human rights at the national , regional and international levels .  
In order to bring about real improvements in the human rights situation in the whole region , it was necessary to adopt a positive strategy aimed at gradually opening up all those societies , rather than resorting to partial measures or economic sanctions resulting in the weakening of the forces of democracy and the emerging civil society , which provided the only guarantees for the promotion and respect of human rights .  
The highest officials in the country were determined to establish the commission and to ensure its independence so that it could examine human rights violations committed in Rwanda by government agencies , individuals acting under cover of the State or national or international organizations operating in Rwanda , and had explained that setting it up had taken a long time owing to the process of selecting its members , but that that process was now coming to an end .  
Once again he drew the attention of the Burundi authorities to the urgent need to ensure the observance of international standards of humanitarian law and human rights , which prohibited indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population and civilian targets during military operations .  
The 1992 amendments confirmed Moroccos support for the principles , rights and obligations deriving from the Charters of the international organizations it has joined and its commitment to universally accepted human rights principles , established the region as a local community , transformed the Constitutional Chamber into the Constitutional Council and raised the Economic and Social Council to the status of constitutional body .  
These new massacres are reminiscent of those committed at Kasika in August 1998 , when more than a-thousand Congolese were also massacred using edged weapons within the compound of a Catholic mission , in response to which the Security Council has still taken no specific action to condemn and halt once and for all this kind of flagrant violation of human rights .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
The period marked increased collaboration between ICMC and several Council agencies , particularly those that extended funding for its actions in favour of persons uprooted or forced into flight because of war and conflict , racial or ethnic persecution , human rights violations , and environmental degradation.The ICMC programmes supported by Council agencies included : 
An ecological branch of the police force was established in 1994 to curb ecological crime , carry out investigations at the request of the public prosecutor , enforce respect of protected areas and prevent the illicit dumping of dangerous and toxic substances which are injurious to the environment and human life and health .  
Article 56 of the law states that " To produce , process , package , import , export , trade , supply , transport , store , keep , have in warehouse or use products or substances that are toxic , dangerous or noxious to human health or to the environment , contrary to the requirements established in laws or regulations " entails a prison sentence ranging from one to four years and a fine .  
She hopes that the legal aspects , geographical conditions , economic , social and cultural factors and the environmental and human considerations underpinning the wise decision to abandon this scheme will be remembered should there be any similar plans in the future .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Reforms were needed to protect the rights of the child : education must be improved , childrens courts must be reformed , the practice of recruiting minors to the armed forces must be stopped , hazardous child labour must be prohibited , and the sexual exploitation of children ( who were often exposed to infection by the human immunodeficiency virus ) must be combated more effectively .  
It was convinced that the members of the Committee would , as in previous years , support in large numbers the current years resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo , as a message that genocide and ethnic cleansing were unacceptable and as a sign of solidarity with the Albanian people .  
The human rights situation left much to be desired in Belarus , especially with respect to freedom of expression : freedom of the press was limited , peaceful demonstrators and journalists had been arrested and beaten , and new media legislation violated international standards .  
Realizing that education was a necessary condition for the protection of human rights , it had introduced universal primary education and had embarked , in cooperation with regional organizations and the United Nations , on a national human rights education programme for all population groups and particularly officials in the judiciary or the executive , legislative and military branches . 
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn a mercenary act in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
This silence is alarming inasmuch as there are situations in which a country ' s press reports in abundant detail on the presence of companies involved in matters of national security and public safety without regard for human rights and in open contradiction with constitutional provisions that categorically state that internal order and security are the exclusive responsibility of the State .  
They also trained the Kamajor paramilitary troops who are fighting the rebel forces of the overthrown Government with the acquiescence of the current Government and are responsible for grave human rights violations against prisoners and the civilian population .  
The Commission attached priority to primary education , with the explicit objective to contribute to the attainment of compulsory primary education free of charge for all as required by international human rights law .  
These divergencies in terms and underlying concepts demonstrate the need for a consistent and comprehensive advocacy for the human rights approach to education so as to integrate human rights into the existing domestic educational policies and laws as well as into international strategies and monitoring mechanisms .  
Non-discrimination is the overriding principle of international human rights law and thus applies to civil and political , as well as to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to the rights of the child which cut across these two categories .  
This Guideline focuses on the review and reform of public health laws to ensure that they address the public health issues raised by HIV AIDS ; that the provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV AIDS ; and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 encourages States to enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws to protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors ; ensure privacy and confidentiality ; ensure ethics in research involving human subjects ; and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies when the laws are breached .  
With regard to the review and reform of criminal laws and correctional systems , UNDP reported that it has conducted a series of three regional training workshops on HIV law and law reform in Colombo , Beijing and Nadi , Fiji , and supported a meeting on the subject of law reform in the context of HIV AIDS and human rights in Bangalore , India , organized by the Indian Law Institute .  
At a time when ways and means were being studied to better coordinate and strengthen the special procedures system , Malaysia , although it recognized the importance of preserving the systems independence and impartiality , stressed that the human rights mechanisms needed to be adjusted and rationalized , that their effectiveness must be increased in order to improve their credibility and that their objectives must be made clear .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
In resolution 34-175 , entitled Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
At its fifty _ fourth session , the Commission , in resolution 1998-7 , approved the text of the draft declaration on the right and responsibility of individuals , groups and organs of society to promote and protect universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , as contained in the annex to that resolution , and decided to consider the question at its fifty _ fifth session .  
As this was the very first occasion for the Special Rapporteur to get acquainted with the human rights situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , I consider as preliminary the opinions , assessments and comments contained in his letter , while looking forward to an in _ depth analysis aimed at projecting a more realistic reflection of the current situation of human rights in the country , particularly concerning Kosovo and Metohija .  
In the light of the aforementioned , Lebanese law guarantees the exercise of the fundamental human rights contained in the international instruments ratified by Lebanon , free of all discrimination .  
The criminal offence of racial and other forms of discrimination ( Penal Code of Yugoslavia , art . 54 ) , involving a violation , on the basis of race , skin colour , nationality or ethnic origin , of the fundamental human rights and freedoms recognized by the international community , is punishable by six months to five years imprisonment .  
Protection , however , extends beyond safeguarding physical security to encompass the broad range of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights provided for under international human rights law .  
In a noteworthy educational project that takes a holistic approach in addressing the needs of the internally displaced and host populations alike , the Norwegian Refugee Council ( NRC ) is developing a nationwide human rights education programme which will provide training and course material on human rights standards to all schools .  
In recognition of the fact that they are based on existing human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , the workshop affirmed that the Guiding Principles do not seek to create a privileged category of persons or to establish a separate legal status for the internally displaced .  
Examining the challenge of averting internal population displacements , the workshop recognized that prevention is a multifaceted undertaking , involving a range of related tasks : eliminating poverty and promoting sustainable development ; ensuring respect for human and minority rights ; establishing equitable and democratic forms of government ; encouraging the peaceful resolution of disputes ; ending social injustice and averting the growth of ethnic or communal antagonisms .  
Further standards are likely to be elaborated and mechanisms established at the international level , especially to ensure that genetic research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human rights and dignity , particularly of vulnerable groups of people . 
The mandate of UNMIBH is to assist the parties in their obligations to provide a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms.The Mission consists of an International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) and a civilian office .  
The Bah International Community , with over five-million members from all strata of society organized as approximately 17 , 000 local communities and 175 national and regional communities , is committed to peace and engaged in a wide range of activities.These activities include but are not limited to fostering grass-roots participation in sustainable development initiatives , advancing the status of women , eliminating racism , and promoting and protecting human rights . 
CHEC has played an active participatory role in most of the major United Nations global conferences since the early 1970 s , with human ecology introducing Commonwealth professionals , international and national NGOs and Governments to the connections between social , economic and ecological systems and human development .  
The CMAs Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics , which were developed in 1993 , are unique in that they represent the only available internationally recognized code of medical ethics to ( a ) deal with conditions of practice in developing countries ; ( b ) set out the ethical obligations of health professionals to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community ; and ( c ) be annotated throughout with references to corresponding internationally recognized human rights instruments .  
Providing increased financial and technical assistance to small island developing States for building human resource and institutional capacity at the national and regional levels ;  
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
Taking into account the progress already made in international and subregional cooperation and coordination to make the most effective use of existing facilities , it should be noted that the major constraints for small island developing States are not so much the lack of scientific knowledge and technology as the shortage of financial and human resources more specifically , the lack of a critical mass of qualified scientists and associated institutions .  
While the Dayton Agreement stopped the fighting and the most egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , underlying issues were to a large extent left to the parties to resolve among themselves on the basis of the Dayton principles .  
Torture is one of the vilest acts to be perpetrated by human beings upon one another.The proceeds paid in to the Fund will contribute to projects providing medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide .  
It is sad but true that the sovereignty arguments can be used and sometimes have the practical result of finding excuses for repressive , even murderous Governments which are engaging in gross violations of the human rights of their own citizens .  
Since the situation of human rights in Myanmar is worsening and the repression of civil and political rights continues unabated , the Special Rapporteur feels bound to renew the detailed recommendations he made in paragraphs 7 to 97 of his last report to the Commission on Human Rights ( E CN . 4-1998-70 ) and in paragraphs 61 to 63 of his interim report to the General Assembly ( A 53-364 ) .  
Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote the role and capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries within the framework of a dialogue between the private and the public sector .  
As members of an organization responsible for the protection of and assistance to more than 26-million people who have sought safety from persecution , war or massive human rights abuses , UNHCR staff members around the world witness daily the untold suffering caused by landmines.Not only do landmines force people to leave their homes in search of safety , they also imperil their flight and later hinder their return .  
This is why we will not support proposals that are designed to subordinate respect for human rights in the context of armed conflict , in accordance with international humanitarian law , to questionable military requirements .  
Mr . LEWIS ( United Nations Childrens FundUNICEF ) said that the establishment of an effective and fair international criminal court would send the unequivocal message from the international community that heinous violations of human rights could not go unpunished .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
The circulation of press organs is not authorized , permission is not given for the functioning of new non _ governmental human rights organizations , which have been waiting for years to be recognized , the movements of the population within the country are controlled by military checkpoints , there is oppressive supervision of all private activity and in practice political dissent is viewed almost as a crime , particularly by the peripheral authorities of the mainland region .  
The problem of impunity was addresses in the agreements reached between the Government and the political parties and there is a formal commitment - set forth in presidential decrees - to impose administrative and judicial penalties on those found guilty of human rights violations .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
The introduction to the Principles contains a refinement of previous working definitions : internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence , in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict , situations of generalized violence , violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters , and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border .  
The argument for including reference to these disasters in the definition is based on cases where Governments respond to such disasters by discriminating against or neglecting certain groups on political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds or by violating the human rights of the affected population in other ways , thereby creating special protection needs .  
WFP welcomed the Principles as a well-formulated consolidation of relevant elements of existing international human rights and humanitarian law , presented in clear , concise language which would increase international awareness of the specific problems internally displaced persons confront as well as the legal norms relevant to addressing their needs .  
Nevertheless , the situation in Azerbaijan underscores that protection for the internally displaced must extend beyond safeguarding their physical security to also encompass the broad range of economic , social , civil and political rights provided for under international human rights law .  
Those approached for consultation include representatives of the office of the Secretary-General and of the ERC , relevant United Nations and other international agencies and organizations engaged in human rights , humanitarian and development work , and academic experts familiar with the issue of internal displacement and the mandate .  
She extended her congratulations to the new members elected at the tenth meeting of States parties , stating that they had joined the human rights treaty body responsible for promoting and defending the rights of half of humanity .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term discrimination against women shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
But the socio-political burdens , the persistence of an apartheid culture which can not be transformed quickly , limited financial resources and still inadequate human resources constitute a considerable hindrance , not to mention the need to take account of the time factor , with South Africans impatient to taste the fruits of freedom even though the quiet revolution under way dates back only to 1994 . 
Some unilateral coercive measures applied against Iran , as well as their adverse economic and social effects on the Iranian people , are reflected in the report ( A 53-293 ) submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the General Assembly under the agenda item entitled ' Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms ' .  
A system permitting an independent body , consisting of respected members of the community , representatives of legal and medical professional organizations and persons nominated by human rights organizations , to visit and report publicly on any place of deprivation of liberty should be set up as soon as possible .  
The Fourth World Conference on Women reaffirmed that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and established a number of specific strategic objectives to ensure that women enjoy their full human rights .  
The action to be taken by Governments includes a range of practical and systematic measures directed at the full implementation of human rights instruments , the promotion of human rights education , the creation of national institutions for promoting women ' s rights , the promotion of the human rights of indigenous women , and the adoption of strategies for the mainstreaming of gender perspectives through increased and strengthened efforts and cooperation .  
The wide-ranging dialogue , with questions from Governments and non _ governmental organizations , covered such issues as female genital mutilation ; violence against women ; womens economic , social and cultural rights ; and ways and means of improving United Nations actions protecting the human rights of women .  
Since her appointment , the independent expert held permanent consultations with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and visited several countries ( Albania , Bulgaria , France , Portugal and Yemen ) where she held consultations with Governments , international organizations , United Nations bodies , Programmes and Funds , as well as key non _ governmental organizations with extensive knowledge on human rights and extreme poverty .  
Further to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognized that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his her civil and political rights .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized ( art . 1 ( 1 ) ) .  
In resolution 51-178 , the General Assembly expressed its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries and reaffirmed that the satisfaction of basic human needs was an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and participation in cultural and social rights .  
The poverty trap in which the poorest of the poor find themselves shows how human rights are indivisible and interdependent : the right to an adequate standard of living , to housing , to education , to work , to good health , to employment , to the protection of the family , to respect for privacy , to legal status and registration as a citizen , to life and physical integrity , to justice and participation in political , social and cultural life .  
The contribution of those living in extreme poverty could be of decisive importance in current thinking on sustainable human development and the right to development , especially since the concept of development is no longer viewed only from an economic standpoint , but also in social and cultural terms .  
International economic sanctions , particularly when imposed by the Security Council , should be conceived in such a way as to avoid aggravating conditions of extreme poverty in the countries concerned.In particular , they should be compatible with the effective exercise of human rights _ and especially economic , social and cultural rights _ by civilians .  
A meeting with the independent expert should be organized in 1999 in order to draw up for the international community the basic elements of a preliminary draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
The draft should use as its starting point the preamble common to the two international Covenants of 1966 , as well as other relevant instruments which recognize that the ideal of the free individual , delivered from fear and poverty , can not be achieved without the creation of conditions allowing each person to enjoy all human rights .  
Although at times a writer may make outrageous statements , even wounding cultural sensitivities and commonly held beliefs , literature remains a basic medium through which imagination and the striving of the human mind are expressed most freely and in the most provocative forms .  
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
Mr . Theuermann ( Austria ) said that he had understood , during the consultations held with the sponsors of the draft resolution , that paragraph 4 had been amended and that after the words fundamental human rights , it had been agreed to add the phrase and reaffirms that the human person is the central subject of development .  
To involve , among others , public opinion leaders , educators , religious leaders , chiefs , traditional leaders , medical practitioners , womens health and family planning organizations and the media in publicity campaigns , with a view to promoting a collective and individual awareness of the human rights of women and girls and of how harmful traditional or customary practices violate those rights ;  
In terms of coverage of programme areas at the global level by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received large shares were human resources development , transport and communications , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources and energy resources .  
Participation in international and regional arrangements allows them to pursue mutually complementary objectives in a holistic manner and to benefit from the synergy generated , but it also burdens them with a multitude of obligations which further stretch their limited resources , both human and financial .  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of OHCHR , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
The system of periodic reporting established within the context of all major international human rights instruments is the central element in monitoring full and effective national implementation of international human rights standards .  
As a result of extensive media outreach and the dissemination of human rights information materials translated into local languages by UNICs , the Secretary-Generals Human Rights Day message was widely publicized , articles and commemorative newspaper supplements were published , public service announcements on the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration were broadcast , and Centre directors appeared on a number of radio and television programmes .  
Secondly , we are somewhat concerned that the reference at the end of the fourth preambular paragraph to human rights and fundamental freedoms could be misconstrued by certain quarters in order to promote objectives which are in fact contrary to the stated objectives of this draft resolution and to promote interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States .  
Those materials included international human rights instruments , memorandum and election reports issued by the Special Representative , relevant domestic laws , training curricula , and free and fair elections posters developed by the office .  
Article 1 of the Declaration states that the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
To ask the leading human rights non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council to submit information and insights relevant to the elimination of obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights .  
The Committee called upon States parties to ensure that the mandates accorded to all national human rights institutions include appropriate attention to economic , social and cultural rights and requested States parties to include details both on the mandates and the major relevant activities of such institutions in their reports to the Committee .  
The Durban Declaration welcomed the growing interest shown worldwide in the establishment or strengthening of independent and pluralistic national institutions , particularly in Africa , and reaffirmed the important role that national institutions must play , both with regard to their responsibilities vis - - vis Governments and their responsibility to promote human rights and provide effective redress when those rights are violated .  
Working sessions focused on presentation by national institutions of their activities , achievements and prospects and the sharing of experiences ; on international and regional cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights ; cooperation for human rights within the framework of follow-up to the Barcelona Declaration adopted in November 1995 ; and free movement of people and human rights with particular reference to the northern and southern part of the Mediterranean basin .  
Participants recognized the important role played by migrants in their relations , and expressed determination to act , both at the multilateral and the bilateral level , to ensure that migrants from any country are treated in full compliance with human rights , basic freedoms and humanitarian principles .  
Participants affirmed that national sovereignty should not be exercised at the expense of respect for human rights , and that real efforts towards the co-development of countries north and south of the Mediterranean , as well as the strengthening of the rule of law , would contribute to reducing erratic migratory flows and facilitate economic cooperation , mutual understanding and cultural exchanges .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be broad enough to cover the concerns of indigenous peoples , including cultural , civil , political and economic rights , health issues , the rights of women and children , education , development , the environment , human rights and conflict prevention and resolution ;  
Contrary to the degrading , inhumane and brutal treatment of detainees held by the Taliban , the Islamic State of Afghanistan , in the light of the fundamental criteria of humanitarian treatment and respect for human dignity , has approached Taliban captives with care .  
In the biennium 20002001 , the focus of the Executive Office will be on improving the provision of programme support in a more efficient and effective manner , both in the traditional areas of responsibility and in the additional aspects of human resources management that are expected to be decentralized and delegated from the central administration of the Secretariat to the Department .  
Recalling that Habitat had made urbanization a priority in its international and national development programme with a view to promoting new policies and strategies in the field of urban management and housing construction , and in response to the aims formulated by Habitat , ACORD put forward its specific response in its report , Action strategy for an innovative approach to the design and construction of human settlements . 
Our approach is guided by a set of basic principles : the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ; the belief that there can be no military solution to the underlying problems of the region ; and the belief that the human and humanitarian rights of all peoples in the conflict must be respected .  
Not only does the use of arms complicate the search for a peaceful resolution of differences , but it is also a source of much human suffering : the displacement of populations , the destruction of socio-economic infrastructures acquired at the cost of great efforts , massive flows of refugees into bordering countries and the sudden spread of disease.This list is not an exhaustive one by any means . 
This criminal , unprecedented act of aggression , in clear support of separatism and terrorism , has already caused massive human losses and enormous destruction of civilian infrastructure all over Yugoslavia , thus provoking enormous humanitarian suffering .  
Thus , social policies designed to increase human capital in essence , health and education perform a vital role in ensuring that people have the assets required to gain access to a suitable position in the labour force , a decent wage and a reasonable level of well-being .  
The main users will be authorities and government officials concerned with environmental management and sustainable development , the programming , coordination and management of the use of natural resources and energy , human settlements , in particular ministries of housing and urban planning and local governments , and international and regional transport .  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
Takes note of the encouraging signs in the struggle against impunity and for the promotion of human rights on the part of the Government of Burundi ; but expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , in particular reports of massacres , enforced or involuntary disappearances , and arbitrary arrests and detention ;  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Considers intolerable that more than 800-million people , especially women and children , throughout the world , and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas ;  
At continuing reports of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in China and severe restrictions on the rights of citizens to the freedoms of non _ violent assembly , association , expression and religion , as well as to due legal process and to a fair trial , including harsh sentences for some seeking to exercise their rights ;  
That , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy their economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their civil and political rights ;  
That the realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and particularly economic , social and cultural rights , is a dynamic process and that , as is evident in today ' s world , a great deal remains to be accomplished ;  
To consider in this context , as appropriate , the desirability of drawing up national action plans identifying steps to improve the situation of human rights in general with specific benchmarks designed to give effect to minimum essential levels of enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
The systematic , widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the Government of Iraq , resulting in an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad _ based discrimination and widespread terror ;  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal action in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the needless loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
Urges the Secretary-General , within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate successfully and , in particular , to provide him with adequate staff based in those territories to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation in the countries of the mandate and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
To help strengthen the capacities of developing countries in sustainable human development through TCDC , the Unit supported a number of strategic initiatives aimed at increasing the sharing of experiences in critical areas and strengthening networking among centres of excellence .  
In the light of the above , the Commission , at its third session ( 23-27 November 1998 ) , agreed to convene an expert meeting on the Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote SME development in developing countries .  
He reported that the Centre had reinforced its technical cooperation efforts and refocused its work on the future challenges and mandates that would arise from the convention , especially through its newly launched global programme against corruption , global programme against trafficking in human beings and global studies on transnational organized crime .  
A consensus was emerging on the fundamentals of sustainable human development , as illustrated by the fact that the Bretton Woods institutions had adopted an approach to development inspired by the United Nations , while the United Nations had moved far in supporting responsible macroeconomic policies on the part of Member States .  
The unified international approach was the determining factor for making faster progress at local , national , regional and hemispheric levels because it was helping establish a common institutional framework for focusing efforts and enhancing the distribution and utilization of the human and financial resources involved .  
It was pleased to note that many countries had taken legal measures to eliminate cultural , religious or traditional practices , including female genital mutilation , that violated the human rights of women and girls.Although in keeping with the duty of States to protect all human rights , such actions were insufficient by themselves to end those practices and should be supplemented with education and public awareness campaigns .  
The Nordic countries considered that the primary rules had now been codified in the major fields of international law , including treaty law , diplomatic and consular law , human rights law , the law of the sea and humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights . 6 . The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
Recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Affirms that globalization is a complex historical process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , and has a direct impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular the right to development , at both the national and the international level ;  
Recognizing also that accountability of individual perpetrators of grave human rights violations is one of the central elements of any effective remedy for victims of human rights violations and a key factor in ensuring a fair and equitable justice system and , ultimately , reconciliation and stability within a State ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for these laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Calls upon the Government of Haiti to continue structural reforms in the police and the judicial system and the improvement of the prison sector , to investigate properly politically motivated crimes and prosecute perpetrators of such crimes in accordance with Haitian law , to take vigorous action to eliminate any continuing human rights violations , including illegal arrests and detentions , and to ensure due process within a reasonable time ;  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , at continuing serious violations of human rights , and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo , affecting ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo personnel and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
Reaffirms that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;  
This political partnership for peace deserves to be supported , especially since through negotiations it is involved in negotiations specifically with the armed and unarmed outside opposition to arrive at an overall peace agreement on which future transition institutions will base themselves to prepare a state of law respectful of human rights and of democratic freedoms .  
To involve , among others , public opinion leaders , educators , religious leaders , chiefs , traditional leaders , medical practitioners , womens health and family planning organizations , the arts and the media in publicity campaigns with a view to promoting a collective and individual awareness of the human rights of women and girls and of how harmful traditional or customary practices violate those rights ;  
Investing and strengthening efforts to meet the basic needs of rural women through capacity-building and human resources development measures and the provision of a safe and reliable water supply , health services , including family planning services , and nutritional programmes as well as education and literacy programmes and social support measures ;  
As part of this strategy of transformation which entails moving from reconstruction to sustainable development , we shall continue our efforts to integrate the region effectively into the global economy by implementing an agenda for competitiveness and sustainable development , based on upgrading our human resources , on making our institutions more effective and our infrastructure more appropriate and on scientific and technological progress . 
We emphasize that , in addition to the direct impact on the physical infrastructure of the health , education , housing and human settlements sectors , one of the principal effects of natures ravages on the population is their increased vulnerability to disease and the deterioration of nutritional and food security ; it is therefore essential to give priority to these aspects on the regional integration agenda .  
Reaffirming its commitment to the process of democratization of States , and acknowledging the interdependence and mutual reinforcement between democracy , human rights and development , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
To consolidate democracy through the promotion of pluralism , the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , maximizing the participation of individuals in decision-making and the development of competent and public institutions , including an independent judiciary , responsible legislature and public service and an electoral system that ensures periodic , free and fair elections ;  
Also bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Without a shared sense of social responsibility and urgency , little progress would be achieved ; on the other hand , the considerable financial , technological and information resources of the private sector , if applied with a sense of social responsibility , could contribute to the cause of human rights .  
Respect for human rights required an integrated vision of rights , under which social and economic rights would be placed on an equal footing with civil and political rights .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Urges also the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , provision of basic social services , poverty eradication , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of youth , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation , respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Moreover , the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects typically requires various measures beyond the establishment of an appropriate legislative framework , such as adequate administrative structures and practices , organizational capability , technical expertise , appropriate human and financial resources and economic stability .  
The growing number of requests received by OHCHR from Governments for specialized technical assistance and advisory services , for instance in the areas of legal reform or the strengthening of civil society , evidences a readiness on the part of Governments to engage partners such as the United Nations and NGOs to strengthen national human rights protection .  
Moreover , it was recognized that compliance with the right to self-determination was a fundamental condition for the enjoyment of other human rights and fundamental freedoms , be they civil , political , economic , social or cultural .  
The representative of the Saami Council also said that self-determination should be understood as an ongoing process of choice for the achievement of human security and the fulfilment of human needs with a broad scope of possible outcomes suited to specific situations .  
The representative of New Zealand indicated that her delegation could accept the inclusion of the right to self-determination in the draft declaration subject to it being consistent with the domestic understanding of the relationship between the Maori and the Crown and with respect for the territorial integrity of democratic States and their constitutional frameworks , where those met current international human rights standards .  
It was also stated by governmental delegations that , in discussing these alternative texts , Governments had taken into account the guiding principles for standard-setting working groups in the field of human rights contained in General Assembly resolution 41-120 and had also borne in mind what had been said at the current and previous sessions on other principles that should be taken into consideration .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , inter alia through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Decentralization of authority and decision-making should be encouraged ; as decentralization proceeds , there is a need to increase local capacities ; policies are needed to promote economic empowerment , enhanced civil participation and increased human resources at the local or community level ; there is a compelling need to evaluate services on the basis of data received from service users at the community level ;  
The key idea that had gained favour within the United Nations system and the international economic institutions that they should coordinate their efforts to achieve consistent , comprehensive development , taking account of every dimension , including the human ignored , whether deliberately or not , the two essential factors , namely financing for development and the structural faults in the mechanisms of the world economy .  
Every State had a sovereign right to enact national legislation that reflected the cultural values and imperatives of the society concerned , ensuring the security and safety of individuals in accordance with internationally agreed principles relating to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
A draft resolution entitled Human rights and cultural diversity , presented under a human rights item , should have remained focused at the national level , where human rights are primarily promoted , protected and respected .  
The current meeting would be another milestone in the quest for sustainable development , which represented a basic precondition for peace and collective human security for global economic order .  
The mission of UNU , a nontraditional international educational institution , is to carry out scholarly work of the highest quality to help resolve pressing global problems of human survival , development and welfare .  
The principle of the indivisibility of the universally recognized civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights continues to be a key element of todays system of promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms .  
The principle of the indivisibility of universally recognized civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights continues to be a key element in todays system of promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms .  
On the one hand , we have witnessed of amazing scientific , technological and material progress , the spread of human rights and democracy and the development of universal international institutions .  
Unless the developing nations are able to have a fair share in rising levels of global prosperity , the advocacy of democratic values and human and social standards will remain hollow .  
Ukraine has signed and ratified all basic international documents in the field of human rights and put in place at the national level effective mechanisms for their implementation .  
To make matters worse , they find it difficult without the requisite technology and human resource base to attract foreign direct investment , which is increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging economies .  
At the other end of the scale , small arms and light weapons obtained through illicit trade account for much of the political , ethnic and criminal killings and human suffering that occur in the less affluent countries of the world .  
We hope that we have all learned the lessons from events which have so seriously affected the country in human , material , psychological and other terms , and that we understand that war will always be a bad master and the worst choice .  
Our common objective is to meet the ever increasing needs of human development in the economic and social spheres , while not simply preserving , but gradually restoring natural ecosystems to conditions that will guarantee environmental sustainability .  
These competencies extended to the special rapporteurs further the advancement and protection of all human rights , both civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural .  
In the broad spectrum of other challenges , such as global epidemics , regional conflicts , nationalist hatred , religious violence and terrorism , one of the very real dangers to human survival still emanates from the existence of weapons of mass destruction .  
From an agency that controlled and regulated all spheres of human activity we move into a phase wherein the State must become more supportive , caring and encouraging of peoples individual and collective endeavours .  
It may also be true that our continent is not yet free from this blight , which has drained some of our countries of resources , both material and human , which should have been used to improve the quality of life of the poor and the disadvantaged .  
Certain basic principles are important for the dialogue among civilizations to be positive and effective and to attain its desired goals , foremost of which is respect for cultural diversity , based on human dignity and equality among individuals .  
It is inspired by a vision of the enormous potential for human development created by the end of the cold war , the accelerated pace of technological development and the deepening interdependence of nations .  
Indias cherished bonds of friendship with the Palestinian people are based on civilizational links spanning almost every aspect of human endeavour : cultural , social , religious , economic and political .  
The Republic of Korea shares the humanitarian concerns of the international community about the human suffering and tragic casualties caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of antipersonnel landmines .  
There is a growing need to modernize the world by addressing global social and political changes on the basis of generally recognized moral , ethical and legal principles : democracy , human rights , equality , justice , freedom and humanism .  
It is a sad and sobering reality that , because of measures imposed or conditions existing in certain countries , women continue to be deprived of basic and fundamental human rights , such as the right to education or the right to gainful employment .  
Among the main laws are the law on educational reform within the framework of sustainable human development which covers social , economic , political and cultural aspects intended to promote peoples growth as individuals and members of society .  
The group recalled that least developed countries were considered to be lowincome developing countries suffering from a low level of human resource development and economic vulnerability , two structural handicaps to economic growth .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is an important factor in the promotion of economic and social development and of human security ,  
Participants also recognized the valuable work performed by the Centre in implementing the global programmes against corruption , trafficking in human beings and transnational organized crime at the regional and national levels .  
It is absolutely clear that , unless the proper security of the national minorities is ensured and their basic human rights are properly protected , they will continue to be subject to violence and thus to feel insecure about returning to Kosovo .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly in the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
The annual assistance flow of around 200-million dollars has alleviated human suffering in the short run and prevented major humanitarian disasters but has not provided the foundation for sustainable development .  
Despite their regrettable lack of resources and the limitations this entails , the existing international procedures for individual legal protection have proven their worth as vital components of international human rights protection .  
Both countries sustained heavy losses of human life and much of their infrastructure and productive economic base have been destroyed , casting more doubts upon the future prospects of these countries to address structural poverty and underdevelopment .  
In the twentyfirst century , a considerable part of the worlds population is being unjustly marginalized in economic , political and social life and left unprotected by international human rights norms .  
That the Government introduce political endeavour and supporting resources to address the systemic barriers and social attitudes standing in the way of the realization of human rights by the ethnic and religious minorities ;  
Human rights education an effective tool to prevent human rights violations should be understood to cover the whole range of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the right to development , as well as those of vulnerable groups .  
The independent expert considered that the advisory services programme had not provided sufficient support for surveys required prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or for the preparation of reports by States in need of assistance .  
The legal ground for action is the United Nations Charter and international law , particularly international humanitarian law , the law of refugees and political , civil , economic , social and cultural human rights law .  
When evidence of the brutal murder of helpless people seeped through international borders , the emerging dilemma for the international community became a moral one : a choice between the sanctity of human lives and strict international standards .  
Devastated by a most brutal civil war , its people decided that saving precious human lives should prevail , even at the cost of potential impunity for those guilty of the most horrific atrocities .  
Without coordinated international efforts , illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing will severely undermine the economic base , food security and , above all , human security of coastal States , and in particular small island developing States .  
However , in the event that the national justice system is unwilling or unable to carry out these functions , the international community must ensure that widespread and systematic human rights violations are dealt with under a wider , universal jurisdiction .  
By civilization , we mean an advanced level of intellectual , cultural and material development within a human society , featuring progress in the arts and sciences , the common use of writing and the emergence of complex political and social institutions .  
In some parts of the world , ethnic , religious and political conflicts had led to the systematic violation of human rights , blatant disregard for humanitarian law and ethnic cleansing .  
While there was no single model to resolve the problem of underdevelopment , international cooperation was increasingly necessary for the strengthening and sharing of the human , institutional , economic and technical capacities of States .  
It has also reinforced the conceptual universality of human rights because remedies will be provided for civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural rights .  
Strategic options being considered include fostering human capital development and the creation of permanent rural jobs through public investments geared to conserving and restoring natural resources ;  
Germany further supports UNSMA 's new Civil Affairs Unit , which will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
The new spiral of fierce armed resistance begun by the Taliban has led to a worsening of the suffering of the Afghan population and to new flagrant violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law .  
Parallel to the understanding of the indivisible nature of human rights is an understanding of the integrated political , economic , social , cultural and environmental nature of development .  
However , an article on return should be accompanied by strong and effective safeguard or saving clauses ensuring the right to international protection against refoulement and guaranteeing the basic human rights of the migrants involved .

My delegation would like to join in the unanimous tribute to the French delegation for its work in presiding over the Council last month and to congratulate it for the outstanding way in which it handled the tragic events that plunged the United States of America and the world into mourning as a result of the horrendous attacks on New York , Washington D.C . and Pennsylvania , which caused incalculable human and material loss .  
While the new Attorney-General has responded favourably to our proposal for monthly working-level meetings , with a view to moving forward the many outstanding and complicated cases of serious crimes involving both Indonesia and East Timor including by judicial cooperation and the support we will continue to extend to the new ad hoc human rights tribunal that President Megawati has decided to establish , with a view to taking to court the first group of suspects identified last year by the then Attorney-General much still needs to be achieved in this area . 
A series of studies the latest being the UNDP human resources assessment report just released have made it clear that government stability will depend upon international expertise in the following areas : finance , legal and justice systems , essential infrastructural services and basic regulatory , administrative and central logistical and procurement systems .  
The overall goal is to find what Mr . Brahimi called a home-grown solution one which is credible , legitimate and sustainable and leads to a broad-based Government which is responsible , representative , stable and accountable ; enjoys both internal and external stability ; respects the human rights of the Afghan people ; and will never again allow the country to be used as a breeding ground for terror or drug trafficking .  
We note with interest the remark contained in paragraph 10 of the report that the history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , regardless of the political system or governing authority in place , has been one of systematic abuse of its natural and human resources , such that a country noted for its vast natural resources was reduced to being one of the poorest and debt-ridden by the early 1990s . 
Article 1 , paragraph 1 , of the Declaration of 1986 states : The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The article spells out three principles : first , there is a human right called the right to development which is inalienable ; second , there is a particular process of economic , social , cultural and political development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized ; and third , the right to development is a human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy that particular process of development .  
However , they will not be regarded as a process of development , as objects of claim , as human rights , so long as they are attended by increased inequalities or disparities and rising concentrations of wealth and economic power , and without any improvement in indicators of social development , education , health , gender balance and environmental protection and , what is most important , if they are associated with any violation of civil and political rights .  
It refers to the realization of all the rights and freedoms recognized as human rights - civil and political rights and economic and social and cultural rights - in their totality as an integrated whole , as all these rights are interrelated and interdependent .  
Since the right to development has been recognized as a human right distinct from the individual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , it is indeed necessary to consider a monitoring mechanism that is separate from the treaty bodies .  
The international community should therefore renew its support for the Office by at least maintaining the level of its contributions thereby enabling it , until such time as definitive solutions were found , to relieve human suffering , particularly in the developing countries , which received the largest number of refugees .  
All forms of human rights civil , cultural , economic , social and political are integral and indivisible rights of our peoples .  
The Sub-Commission , noting that actual or potential conflicts exist between the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement and the realization of economic , social and cultural rights in relation to access to patented pharmaceuticals and the implications for the enjoyment of the right to health , requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to undertake an analysis of the human rights impacts of the TRIPS Agreement .  
The Commission appointed Mr . Fantu Cheru as independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights .  
The Scientific Committees mandate included review of published scientific reports and technical documents with the aim of assessing regional and global levels of human exposure to radiation and its potential harmful effects .  
In its resolution 2000 / 64 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite all States to provide practical examples of activities that have been effective in strengthening good governance practices for the promotion of human rights at the national level , including activities in the context of development cooperation between States , for inclusion in a compilation of indicative ideas and practices that could be consulted by the interested States when required .  
COHCHR has also received allegations of police violence and excessive use of force , summary and extrajudicial execution , disappearance , mob killings , torture , political intimidation and violence against members of political parties , in particular the opposition party , including instances of extrajudicial execution , interference of the executive in judicial matters , curtailment of the freedom of association and expression and intimidation of human rights defenders .  
Meetings were held with authorities at the local and national level with the purpose of gathering additional information on allegations , and to assist the authorities in their role of promoting human rights by sharing information on allegations collected by the Office .  
The Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments assert the fundamental principle of non-discrimination : everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in these instruments , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , birth or status .  
The Fourth World Conference on Women reaffirmed that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and established a number of specific strategic objectives to ensure that women enjoy their full human rights .  
It must , however , not be forgotten that migrants are people and that , as such , they have abilities , strengths and potential that need to be enhanced and developed on the basis of respect for their cultural identity , their religious beliefs and all the ways in which they express themselves as human beings and persons wishing to live in dignity .  
According to Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction . . . .  
The Declaration provides guidance for realizing development and human rights in a complementary and comprehensive manner , and identifies international cooperation as a duty of the international community ; in this framework , international cooperation should focus on the elimination of obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and the formulation of international development policies for ensuring development and eliminating obstacles thereto .  
The Declaration emphasizes the important role of international cooperation for , and the valuable work of individuals , groups and associations in contributing to , the effective elimination of all violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of peoples and individuals , including in relation to mass , flagrant or systematic violations of human rights .  
That the status of the practices of democracy , rights and freedoms in the French-speaking community over the past 10 years reflects undeniable progress : the constitutional recognition of the importance of human rights , the establishment of the institutional framework for democracy and human rights , the existence of checks and balances , progress in establishing multiparty systems in many French-speaking countries and in holding free , credible and transparent elections , the contribution of the opposition to the working of democracy , the promotion of local democracy through decentralization ;  
That the current status also reflects some shortcomings and failures : recurring conflicts , interruptions in democratic processes , genocide and massacres , serious violations of human rights , the persistence of behaviours hindering the development of a democratic culture , the lack of independence in certain institutions , and economic , financial and social constraints , which cause citizens to lose faith in democracy ;  
Democracy is a system of universal values and is based on recognition of the inalienable nature of the dignity and equal value of all human beings ; everyone has the right to play an active role in social , professional and political life and to enjoy the right to development ;  
The rule of law implies that all institutions are subject to the law and also implies the separation of powers , the free exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as the equality before law of citizens , male and female ; all of these aspects form the constitutive elements of a democratic system of government ;  
The Special Rapporteur then examines the differences between traditional and new forms of mercenary activities , the relationship between terrorism and mercenary activities , the problems raised in connection with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law by private security and military assistance companies operating internationally and the limits and shortcomings of the legal definition of mercenary activities .  
Such arrangements are preferable because they are regulated by clear legal provisions , act in accordance with a transparent line of command and are fully responsible for any violations of international humanitarian law or human rights .  They are also familiar with the territory and the peoples where they operate .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to prevailing standards of international humanitarian law applying to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
Categorizations of education into primary , elementary , fundamental , or basic are not internationally comparable and are unsuited to the requirements of international human rights law , which embodies the principle that children have to be in school until they reach the minimum age for employment .  
These killings are symptoms of deeply rooted and complex social , economic and political problems coupled with surging crime rates , which continue to plague the human rights situation in these countries .  
However , in the event that the national justice system is unwilling or unable to carry out this function , the international community must ensure that widespread and systematic human rights violations are dealt with under a wider , universal jurisdiction .  
By social protection , we understand the responsibility of societies to see that the fundamental needs of all are met , based on universal human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural .  
It justly identified deepening poverty and inequality , proliferating conflict , the deadly spread of the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) and continuing discrimination , particularly against women and girls , as formidable challenges in developing future actions for children .  
The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna had reached consensus on areas for action and objectives for the promotion of human rights , which no longer covered only civil and political rights but also , on an equal footing , economic , social and cultural rights .  
The policy of civil harmony , introduced by the President of the Republic and clearly ratified by popular referendum , the goodwill and clemency measures , and the unusual openness in the political arena and among the communications media reflected the determination of the Algerian people and of the public authorities to continue to strengthen the democratic process , creating a genuine culture of human rights and a more just society , without fear or arbitrariness .  
Until recently , the right to development had not received the recognition it deserved , and yet several developing countries had been chastised for alleged human rights violations , and their failures had been magnified disproportionately , while they were doing their utmost to satisfy the basic necessities of their rapidly growing populations .  
The Administration was determined to pursue its current efforts to consolidate its achievements in social , cultural , economic and political fields , and to intensify its endeavours to ensure the progressive enjoyment of all aspects of human rights by the people of Myanmar .  
A high-level council for human rights had been established , with links to international organizations and local non-governmental organizations , and efforts were being made to involve the people in public life , especially through the establishment of non-governmental organizations in the human rights field dealing with political , social and economic questions .  
Despite the strenuous efforts of the international community to protect human rights and ensure fundamental freedoms , gross human rights violations continued to occur in many areas of the world , particularly areas embroiled in civil wars and conflicts , during which innocent civilians , including children and women , were victims of the indiscriminate use of force .  
The public authorities guaranteed the effective implementation of human rights , and all detected abuses had received the judicial and administrative attention required by law .  
The declaration should affirm the right of every human being hence , also those who are deprived of all their essential rights , wherever in the world they may be to live in an environment in which their human dignity is respected and to enjoy their fundamental rights fully and completely and thus be able to assume their responsibilities towards their families and communities .  It should take into account the efforts and initiatives of individuals and groups living in extreme poverty .  
The role of the Working Group on Communications , under the revised procedure , is to examine communications and any governmental replies with a view to bringing to the attention of the Working Group on Situations any particular situations which appear to reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 11 The Working Group of the Subcommission will now meet after the annual session of the Subcommission rather than before , as was previously the case . 
The representative of New Zealand , noting the absence of a legal framework specific to internally displaced persons , stated that such persons were of course covered by international human rights law and that there was no excuse for States not to follow such international human rights principles and the legal guidance based on them as contained in the Guiding Principles ( S / PV . 4130 ) .  
The statement provided an opportunity to recall the inclusive and broad-based process through which the Principles were developed , their basis in existing international human rights and humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , and to inform delegates of the ways in which the Principles were proving valuable to international organizations , NGOs , displaced communities and also to Governments . 23 .  As a sign of the increased and welcome emphasis on internal displacement , a panel discussion on the issue was convened during the Segment , moderated by the Emergency Relief Coordinator a.i .  
First and foremost , they are to engage in dialogue with national and local authorities , in particular to impress upon them their primary responsibility for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons in conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law , as elaborated in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement .  
That was creating a vicious circle in which the right to freedom of expression had only limited relevance for those who were hungry and , likewise , the right of freedom of association for those who were homeless or the most generous provisions of human rights treaties for those who were illiterate or were struggling to meet their basic needs .  
Governments had a key role to play in implementing policies aimed at promoting financial , social and economic stability , harnessing the benefits of globalization and promoting and protecting human rights at the national and international levels .  
Its innovative programmes in the field of sustainable development , for example the BIOTRADE initiative and the greenhouse gas emission trading rights programme , could sow the seeds of a future development model featuring economic growth compatible with life , human values and nature .  
The climate of tension resulting from dangerous Israeli actions , including killing of defenceless children , had impaired development activities and threatened the human resource base of present and future Palestinian generations .  
Moreover , pending the conclusion of consultations with the Government of Angola and until the establishment by the Security Council in its resolution 1268 ( 1999 ) of 15 October 1999 of the United Nations Office in Angola , the substantive MONUA personnel required to maintain liaison with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities of Angola , as well as its human rights component , were also retained in the country as part of the Observer Missions staffing establishment .  
These efforts will be pursued in an integrated manner , supported by the three global programmes against transnational organized crime , trafficking in human beings and corruption , and in close coordination with the global programme against money laundering of the Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention .  
Mongolia reiterated its keen interest in continuing to cooperate with the Office of the High Commissioner in the four areas of action included in the Framework for Regional Technical Cooperation : formulating national action plans ; strengthening national human rights institutions ; human rights education ; and strategies for promoting economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
With respect to the financing of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , although the regular budget for the biennium 2000-2001 included a modest increase in the resources allocated to the human rights programme , it was not sufficient to meet the demand imposed by the growing number of human rights programmes carried out by the United Nations system .  
Her Government was gratified that during the current year , the Commission on Human Rights had recognized the inseparable links between good governance and respect for human rights , and it looked forward to continuing to cooperate with other Governments , particularly in the Asian and Pacific region , in order to find practicable ways of giving good governance the priority that it deserved . 
Australia particularly deplored the human rights situation of women and girls in Afghanistan as a result of the Talibans strict social policies , and appealed to all Afghan factions to respect universal human rights standards and to abide by the principles of international law by allowing free and safe access for United Nations personnel to deliver vitally needed humanitarian aid .  
To that end , the international community must take the economic , social and cultural aspects of human rights into account by promoting and implementing the relevant international conventions so that they could have a real impact on those rights and on the improvement of the living conditions of all people .  
Chile was a nation acting in full unison with the international community , possessed of a civil society that was increasingly involved in national affairs , a respect for human rights and the rule of law and courts that dispensed justice strictly and responsibly , a nation with an open , booming economy , which was working steadily to do away with inequalities .  
His Government had always attached great importance to the protection of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , as reflected in his countrys Constitution , which guaranteed all citizens those rights .  
It complied with international human rights instruments and conventions on the basis of its historical , religious , economic and cultural heritage , always within the framework of political pluralism , freedom of expression and elected representation in peoples assemblies and local bodies and in popular organizations covering all sectors of the population .  
UNFPA is also working collaboratively with key United Nations agencies and other relevant partners in the follow-up to UNCED through the Task Manager system , including global initiatives in the areas of basic social services , ageing , gender , youth , health , human rights , education , HIV / AIDS , food security and sustainable development to highlight the linkages between population and reproductive health , a higher quality of life , poverty reduction and the provision of an enabling environment .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction whatsoever , was also underlined .  
Bearing in mind the existing efforts in this respect , it is necessary to enhance efforts at evaluating and addressing the impact of international economic issues such as international macro-economic decisions-making , debt burden , international trade , market access , functioning of international financial institutions , transfer of technology , bridging of the knowledge gap ( digital divide ) , impact of intellectual property regimes , fulfilment of international development commitments and migration issues on the enjoyment of human rights .  
The Working Group underlined the importance to realizing the right to development of strengthening good governance at the national level including through building effective and accountable institutions for promoting growth and sustainable human development , while recognizing of course that responsibility for determining and implementing good governance practices rests with the State concerned .  
At the national level these pertained to a regulatory framework , legal security , combating corruption , political and macroeconomic stability , market size ( through regional economic cooperation ) , growth potential and the availability of infrastructure and human resources .  
These measures included , in particular , improving the policy and operational framework for FDI , so as to put it on a par with best practice ; rationalizing fiscal incentives ; setting up a super agency to promote and facilitate investment ; fast-tracking privatization ; and implementing strategies for upgrading the human capital base .  
In addition to the five major themes on its agenda , the World Conference should also take up other important issues , especially ways to reduce ethnic tensions and to prevent ethnic and racial conflicts ; the economic impact of racism ; discrimination against migrant workers ; the question of asylum-seekers , refugees and disabled persons ; trafficking in human beings ; assaults on minorities and vulnerable groups ; the rights of indigenous peoples ; and the role of the Internet and of communications technologies .  
His delegation wished to emphasize the importance of intensifying international cooperation with a view to implementing the Vienna Declaration , which set out recommendations in the following areas : protecting the environment and managing natural resources , using space applications for human security , development and welfare , advancing scientific knowledge of space and protecting the space environment , enhancing education and training opportunities and ensuring public awareness of the importance of space activities .  
The Court , inter alia , said : The political decision not to end the conflict by violent means but to seek negotiated and concerted solutions is an act of sovereignty on the part of the State , since it adopts exceptional measures to deal with an irregular situation , recover its capacity to suppress and punish crime and bring fresh impetus to a just , social , political and economic order which truly protects and secures human rights .  
Among the facts which the report fails to mention are the initial study of ideas on a cease-fire and termination of hostilities designed to provide a climate more favourable to the building of peace ; the agreement on human rights and international humanitarian law in the zone proposed for peace talks with the ELN ; and the ELNs unilateral and unconditional return of individuals whom it was holding .  
The Special Representative wishes , once more , to conclude his report by urging all concerned authorities and organizations , in Africa as well as in the United Nations , to use all possible means to ensure that peace and security finally prevail and are respected throughout the Great Lakes region ; that all civilian populations in the region are fully protected ; and that their basic economic needs are fulfilled .  These are the fundamental requirements for allowing a culture of human rights to develop and to take deep root in the region .  
The High Commissioner of Human Rights , closing the seminar , emphasized the need to make the links between human rights and poverty explicit , so that human rights principles would be used both by the poor to know and claim their rights , and by the international community to provide special protection to those in extreme poverty .  
The Expert Seminar on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty identified the need for new guiding principles , which would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of extreme poverty , that clarified definitional issues within the framework of human rights and that set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
Member States should be invited to consider adopting at the national level such measures , including legislation , that would ( a ) discourage all actions and activities , commercial or otherwise , that could be prejudicial to the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories ; and ( b ) promote full respect for the human rights of peoples living under foreign domination and facilitate their recourse to judicial proceedings in order to gain economic and social restitution .  
The Committee notes the establishment of the Justice and Legal Systems Research Institute , which is contributing to the review of existing national legislation in the light of the standards set by applicable international human rights instruments , including the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
Additionally , it is recommended that the State party undertake further measures , including the allocation of adequate human and financial resources , to develop youth-friendly counselling , care and rehabilitation facilities for adolescents , especially girls , which would be accessible by them without parental consent ; in this regard , the Committee notes the development of Adolescent Health Corners at the regional level and recommends that the State party pursue its objective of establishing such facilities at the district level .  
The Committee recommends that the State party conduct a comprehensive review of the Basic Law and domestic laws , including administrative regulations and legal procedural rules , to ensure that they conform to international human rights standards , including the Convention , that they are sufficiently clear and precise , are published , and are accessible to the public .  
The Committee recommends that the State party take all effective measures , including enacting or rescinding legislation where necessary , to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in the recognition , exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil , economic , political , social and cultural life .  
The Committee welcomes the State partys efforts in the field of education , in particular the inclusion of human rights teaching , including childrens rights , in the school curricula , but it remains concerned about the high drop-out and repetition rates in primary and secondary schools , disparities between urban and rural areas in terms of access to education and to quality education , the insufficient number of well-trained teaching staff and childrens limited access to materials and text books .  
The discussion is expected to explore the impact that the violence suffered by children in schools and within the family has on their enjoyment of all other human rights , and in particular the right to development of the child , including physical , mental , spiritual , moral , psychological and social development in a manner compatible with human dignity .  
The theme will include : human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  10 .  Adoption of the report of the Commission on its fifth session .  
The theme would include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  
Recalling that , according to the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights , the international community must treat all human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , and that while the significance of the national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Reaffirm that national human rights institutions should be established following an appropriate and inclusive process of consultation and be independent , pluralistic and based on universal human rights standards ;  
Reaffirm that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to , inter alia , financially and technologically support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to assist them , wherever possible , in the fulfilment of their obligations with regard to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) United Nations organizations are willing to cooperate ; ( b ) all parties concerned display the necessary political will ; ( c ) sufficient human and financial resources are available ; and ( d ) the economic and political situation of African countries is stable .  
The provisional expansion of UNOMSIL was supported by additional resources utilized for the deployment of military observers and additional international civilian staff in the fields of political and civil affairs and human rights , as well as for the necessary administrative , technical and logistical support services .  
In the area of information management , priority is attached to completing the implementation of a global information system on human resources , including an automated system of collecting and processing vital data on staff members and applicants with a view to facilitating related processes with respect to filling vacancies with internal and external candidates , including those from the national competitive examinations .  
The form of the assistance included study tours and training and the fields covered were corruption , crime detection , crime prevention strategies , criminal information collection and analysis , customs , drug-related crime , economic crime , evidence-gathering , extradition , financial investigation , institutional structures , institution-building , investigation materials , international standards and human rights , juvenile justice , money-laundering investigations , mutual legal assistance and organized crime .  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported conducting a wide range of activities aimed at strengthening human rights in the administration of justice , noting that further information was contained in a forthcoming analytical report of the High Commissioner to the Commission of Human Rights on the implementation of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 104 ) .  
The delegations also cited the report of the Secretary-General , which identified inadequate or unaffordable transport as factors contributing to excessive building and population congestion , causing deterioration of local environments , and noted that inadequate urban transport systems are also associated with increased incidence of accidents and adverse impacts on human health .  
The third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was cited , which underscored that human activities are affecting the Earths climate , with potentially significant ecological and economic effects , and that it would be necessary to understand the interrelationships between transportation systems , technology and local and global atmospheric effects as the way forward is being planned . 
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
It was noted that international development cooperation has a decisive role to play in enhancing the trade competitiveness of developing countries through the development , transfer and assimilation of technology ; promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises ; strengthening of financial systems ; development of highly qualified human resources ; and improvement of public school systems , especially in the areas of formal and non-formal vocational training . 
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
Note with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be victims of varied , evolving and sophisticated contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular nationals of different origins , migrant workers , asylum-seekers , refugees and foreigners ;  
Express our deep concern that the socio-economic development of our continent is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
Express our firm conviction that the development of democratic systems of government in Africa , which guarantee full access and representation of all sectors of our societies , respect for and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , equitable distribution of wealth and access to economic advancement , active promotion of peace , preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution and an equitable international economic environment , is an essential prerequisite for the prevention of conflicts and instability in Africa ;  
Reaffirm that the discriminatory treatment of foreigners and migrant workers established or practised in certain countries , inter alia concerning granting visas , work permits , conditions of family members , housing and access to justice , based on race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin , are human rights violations which seriously contradict the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families ;  
Affirm that the first logical and credible step to be taken at this juncture of our collective struggle is for the World Conference to declare solemnly that the international community as a whole fully recognizes the historical injustices of the slave trade and that colonialism and apartheid are among the most serious and massive institutionalized forms of human rights violations ;  
Recall that article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination already contains the obligation to provide effective protection and remedies for everyone against any acts of racial discrimination which violate human rights and fundamental freedoms , a principle reaffirmed by numerous subsequent human rights instruments including the basic principles and guidelines on the right to a remedy and reparation for victims of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Also strongly reaffirm that as a pressing requirement of justice , victims of human rights violations as a result of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should be assured effective protection and remedies as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage as a result of violations in the implementation of human rights standards ;  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism .  
This will generally require basic policies relating to areas such as the balance between public - and private-sector control of such technologies , cooperation with other countries in technical and legal matters and the balance between the application of basic human rights such as the freedom of expression and privacy rights and the effective regulation of the technologies to maximize the benefits derived from them .  
The international community should also assist the small developing economies to overcome their constraints , such as lack of financial , technical and human resources , in applying WTO consistent anti-dumping actions against injurious imports , including through institutional capacity-building , assistance in the elaboration of legislation and the setting up of investigation authorities .  
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
Gravely concerned at the persistent violation by Israel of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as the grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto .  
She outlined a number of initiatives under way : at global management meetings , human resources issues were always on the agenda ; an Intranet site on staff morale had been established , which encouraged free and open dialogue ; the services of ombudspersons were being used to a greater extent ; and joint workshops for programme and operations staff were being held .  
The review sought to examine programme objectives and strategies aimed at reducing social disparities and gaps in basic human development , through integrated demonstration programmes , including basic social services ( primary education , health , water and sanitation ) , and to assess the institutional capacity-building for local management and decision-making , as well as community participation .  
Recalling that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , peace , democracy , justice , equality , rule of law , pluralism , development , better standards of living and solidarity ,  
Expresses its deep conviction that a social order able to guarantee the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms can only be founded on a democratic society based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic and cultural system and on the peoples full participation in all aspects of their lives , and characterized by equity , social justice and non-discrimination ;  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Urges all States to foster a democracy that , inspired by the recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family , promotes peoples welfare , rejecting all forms of discrimination and exclusion , facilitates development with equity and justice , and encourages the most comprehensive and full participation of their citizens in the decision-making process and in the debate over diverse issues affecting society ;  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Although recent advances in genetic research have made it possible to identify the genetic origin of the diseases affecting human beings and to develop prevention and early detection strategies , this same genetic information can also be used to establish new parameters for classifying individuals on the basis of their genetic quality , which undoubtedly will have unpredictable consequences for individual economic , social , cultural and professional development . 
Considers it intolerable that 826-million people , most of them women and children , throughout the world and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically fragile areas ;  
Welcoming the commitment made by heads of State and Government in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to make the right to development a reality for everyone and their resolve to create an environment - at the national and global levels alike - which is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty , and their commitment to spare no effort to promote good governance and democracy and to strengthen the rule of law as well as respect for all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development ,  
Recognizes that in order to realize the right to development , national action and international cooperation must reinforce each other in a manner that goes beyond the measures for realizing each individual right , and also recognizes that international cooperation for the realization of the right to development should be conducted in a spirit of a partnership , in full respect of all human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated ;  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;  
Recognizes , while bearing in mind the existing efforts in this respect , the importance of evaluating the impact of international financial , economic , monetary and multilateral trading systems on the enjoyment of human rights , while noting that issues such as those listed below are obstacles to the full realization of the right to development :  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Stresses the crucial role of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement and underlines the obligations of all parties under the Peace Agreement to act in accordance with international human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law , and to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including civil and political rights ;  
Reiterates its call upon all States and parties to the Peace Agreement to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and effective , functioning democratic institutions will be central elements in developing civilian structures consistent with the territorial integrity of all States in the region , within their internationally recognized borders , taking fully into account all relevant Security Council resolutions ;  
Further welcomes the commitment of , and encourages efforts by , the new democratic Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to investigate past abuses of human rights , including violations of human rights of individuals belonging to ethnic groups in Kosovo ; repression and harassment of peaceful political activists ; illegal and / or hidden detentions ; and other violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire situation in Iraq , which affects the population , in particular children , as stated in the reports of several United Nations human rights treaty bodies , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
Gravely concerned at the persistent violation by Israel of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as the grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto ,  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Through its constructive partnerships with Government authorities and civil society at the local and national levels , the Human Rights Division of UNOA is actively helping to create sustainable mechanisms and processes that contribute to enabling institutions to protect human rights and for Angolans to know and exercise them .  These partnerships involve various activities and projects that are almost exclusively funded through voluntary contributions .  
How was it possible for children to fully enjoy their rights to education , to a healthy childhood , to play and recreation , and to healthy development in other words , all the rights to which they were entitled as human beings when they were confronted daily with the appalling consequences of armed conflict and foreign occupation , when they lacked even the most basic needs and when their very protection and survival were at stake ?  
Despite the existence of an array of international legal instruments to protect children in armed conflict , the human rights of children continued to be violated with impunity ; there was clearly a need to reverse the trend from blatant disregard to strict observance of those instruments .  
Deeply concerned at continued reports of widespread violence against civilians and on alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , torture , arbitrary detentions , ad hoc detention locations and continued abuses and harassment at checkpoints by Russian State agents in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation ,  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
Reiterates its call upon the Russian Federation to establish , according to recognized international standards , a national broad-based and independent commission of inquiry to investigate promptly alleged violations of human rights and breaches of international humanitarian law committed in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation in order to establish the truth and identify those responsible , with a view to bringing them to justice and preventing impunity ;  
Expresses serious concern over the slow pace of investigating alleged serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed by federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians and notes with concern that very few such cases have reached the judicial system ;  
Calls upon the Russian Federation to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors offices undertake systematic , credible and exhaustive criminal investigations and prosecutions of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights , in particular of those members of federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians allegedly implicated in war crimes and human rights violations and to pursue with rigour the cases which have been referred to them ;  
Urges the relevant authorities to take all necessary measures to avoid and limit the most cruel forms of corporal punishment in particular by applying alternative punishment and taking into account attenuating circumstances to the maximum extent possible provided for in national legislation and consistent with international human rights norms and standards ;  
Welcomes the report submitted by the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights , to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 56 ) , commends the independent expert for his valuable work and encourages him to continue studying these issues further ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all their forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and the rule of law and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of the State ;  
Recalls that international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social and cultural character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is one of the purposes of the United Nations , and affirms that wider international cooperation would contribute to lasting progress in implementing economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,  
Also encourages Governments , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , international agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide judges , lawyers , political and other public officials , community leaders and other concerned persons , as appropriate , with information and human rights education concerning womens equal ownership of , access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing ;  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of United Nations peacekeeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , as well as to other pertinent international instruments ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with the mandate of the High Commissioner established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
April 2001 , endorses the Commissions decision to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions for three years , and approves the Commissions request to the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with an adequate and stable level of human , financial and material resources in order to enable her to continue to carry out her mandate effectively , including through country visits .  
Recalling that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , peace , democracy , justice , equality , rule of law , pluralism , development , better standards of living and solidarity ,  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Urges all States to foster a democracy that , inspired by the recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family , promotes peoples welfare , rejecting all forms of discrimination and exclusion , facilitates development with equity and justice , and encourages the most comprehensive and full participation of their citizens in the decision-making process and in the debate over diverse issues affecting society ;  
Global Education Associates ( GEA ) is an association of individual and institutional associates in more than 90 countries , working to advance global systems that will ensure ecological integrity , peace , human rights , economic and social well-being , and democratic participation , with special care to include the voices and perspectives of poor and marginalized people of diverse cultural and religious traditions . 
Good governance , according to article 9 of the Cotonou agreement signed by all 77 ACP countries and the EU , implies a political and institutional environment that upholds human rights , democratic principles , the rule of law , and the transparent and accountable management of human , natural , economic and financial resources .  
To include all IPF / IFF proposals for action in the plan of action is perhaps neither feasible nor practical considering the short initial time-horizon of UNFF , as well as the limited financial , human , scientific and technical resources available for implementation .  
The programme , by facilitating greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , on adopting a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on adopting more efficient methods of preventing human rights violations and removing obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
The programme of work aims at the adoption and implementation of an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the right to development , a significant enhancement of support for that right from relevant United Nations bodies and a significant increase in the recognition of economic , social and cultural rights as human rights and their integration into the strategies and programmes of international organizations , agencies and financial and developmental institutions .  
The programme further aims at reinforcing the role of the United Nations as the unique worldwide forum for the discussion and resolution , with the participation of all relevant actors , of human rights matters of international concern , through its support for human rights bodies and organs and its adoption and progressive implementation of an improved treaty monitoring system , which deals with multiple reporting obligations and is based on a comprehensive national approach .  
Other areas of work that will receive special attention include : effective education and public information programmes ; strengthened contribution of non-governmental organizations , national institutions , grass-roots organizations and other relevant elements of civil society in United Nations human rights activities at all levels , according to the legislative mandates in effect regarding those issues ; effective human rights field activities and operations ; and support for the implementation of a strengthened system of special procedures based on harmonization and rationalization of work .

Reaffirming that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Encourages the continuing efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reduce the prison population by releasing minors , elderly prisoners , prisoners suffering from terminal illness and suspects with incomplete files who were detained for their alleged involvement in genocide and other abuses of human rights , urges the Government of Rwanda to accelerate these efforts and reaffirms the urgent need to complete a dossier for every detainee with a view to identifying those who should be released immediately , early or conditionally , while expressing concern at the high number of detainees still awaiting trial ;  
A report completed by MONUC human rights officers indicates that the above agreement is being respected but concludes that , unless actions are undertaken by the international community to diffuse tension , further violent and uncontrolled confrontations can be expected .  
The Secretary-General remains cognizant of the fact that , in order to be held accountable for discharging their responsibilities , managers need to have authority and control over their human and financial resources , timely and accurate information about the status of the resources assigned to them and training , as required .  
In this context , human resources directors meet prior to the sessions of the International Civil Service Commission to review matters under consideration by the Commission , appoint spokespersons to represent the executive heads of the participating organizations at the Commission sessions and put forward common positions on the relevant issues under consideration .  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , in the personnel and general administration areas the High-level Committee on Management will place emphasis on human resources management and reform of the common system by continuing specific studies covering the role and function of the international civil service and its underpinnings , the development of a senior management cadre , the further development of system-wide standards on contractual patterns and employment conditions and the implications of other management reforms , such as downsizing and outsourcing , for the participating organizations .  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Welcoming the commitment made by heads of State and Government in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to make the right to development a reality for everyone and their resolve to create an environment - at the national and global levels alike - which is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty , and their commitment to spare no effort to promote good governance and democracy and to strengthen the rule of law as well as respect for all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development ,

The Commission recalls the commitment of the Government of Indonesia to ensure that the violations of human rights and humanitarian law committed during the violence in 1999 are accounted for and welcomes in this context the concrete steps already taken by the Government of Indonesia , including the efforts by the Attorney-General of Indonesia to investigate fully the violations of human rights and international and humanitarian law perpetrated in East Timor in the period leading up to and immediately following the popular consultation held in August 1999 .  
Recognizing also that accountability of individual perpetrators of grave human rights violations is one of the central elements of any effective remedy for victims of human rights violations and a key factor in ensuring a fair and equitable justice system and , ultimately , reconciliation and stability within a State ,  
Considers it intolerable that 826-million people , most of them women and children , throughout the world and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically fragile areas ;

Also encourages Governments , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , international agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide judges , lawyers , political and other public officials , community leaders and other concerned persons , as appropriate , with information and human rights education concerning womens equal ownership of , access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing ;  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to continue to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Calls upon all States to take all necessary measures to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by children with disabilities and , where necessary , to develop and enforce legislation against their discrimination to ensure dignity , promote self-reliance and facilitate the childs active participation in the community , including adequate and effective access to education of good quality for children with disabilities and their parents , taking into account the situation of children with disabilities living in poverty ;  
It is saddening that at the dawn of the twenty-first century and the strides that humanity has made in constructing a new international environment , where respect for international law and legality and full protection of human rights constitute the cornerstone of the policy of States , the Turkish Republic continues to behave in a manner reminiscent of some of the worst periods of the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries , with an anachronistic approach in its relations with its neighbours based on threats and the use of force . 
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Express our conviction that political platforms based on racism , xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and discrimination must be condemned as incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance , and that racial discrimination condoned by governmental policies violates human rights and may endanger friendly relations among peoples , cooperation among nations , and international peace and security ;  
Urge States to reaffirm their democratic commitment and take the necessary legislative , administrative and judicial measures , in accordance with their obligations under regional and international human rights instruments , to condemn and actively discourage all forms of propaganda , publicity , organizations , associations , political parties or groups inspired by ideas or theories of the superiority of one race or ethnic group and that seek to justify or promote racial hatred , xenophobia or racial discrimination ;  
Urge States to give priority to promoting and protecting the full and equal enjoyment by women and men of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction of any kind as to race , colour , gender , sexual orientation , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
Stress that education and training programmes , as well as other social policies , should promote more inclusive societies , encouraging stable and harmonious relationships and friendships between different nations , peoples and groups , fostering mutual understanding , solidarity , tolerance , development of a culture of peace , the study of the Holocaust and injustice against indigenous peoples and people of African descent in the Americas , social justice and respect for human rights for all ;  
Encourage all relevant actors to intensify their efforts at the national , regional and international levels , especially by means of education , to ensure that children are educated from an early age in those values , attitudes and ways of conduct and life that will allow them to resolve conflicts of a racial or ethnic character peacefully , in a spirit of respect for human dignity , tolerance and non-discrimination ;  
Request States to make a serious commitment to adopting more appropriate measures to ( a ) combat illegal acts motivated by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance against individuals , communities or groups of persons ; ( b ) protect victims of discrimination and provide them with security against future threats ; ( c ) punish those responsible for such crimes and violations of human rights ; and ( d ) make every effort to ensure that national and local public authorities act accordingly ;  
As stated in its resolution 1291 ( 2000 ) of 24 February 2000 , the Security Council , inter alia , authorized MONUC to consist of political , human rights , humanitarian affairs , public information , child protection and medical and administrative support components .  
This proposal is based on current UNDP programmes concerned with the rule of law and comprises five main goals : ( a ) national capacity-building in the judicial sphere ; ( b ) support to the participatory process of judicial reform ; ( c ) improved access to justice ; ( d ) consolidation of institution-building in the main bodies responsible for public security , the Haitian National Police and the Prison Authority ; and ( e ) national capacity-building in the area of respect for and promotion of human rights .  
This encompasses a broad and balanced approach , placing equal emphasis on all human rights civil and political , economic , social and cultural , as well as the right to development .  
The suffering of Palestinian children caused by Israeli acts of aggression aimed at killing and maiming children , coupled with the lack of facilities to shelter them , Israels abandonment of all values and human rights and its flouting of all international instruments , and its refusal to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to establish a just peace in accordance with the legitimate decisions of the international community , causing heightened suffering among the Arab population under occupation and denying their children all the rights enshrined in the precepts of God and humanitarian law .  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
The Executive Heads acknowledged that , while non-governmental organizations were one of a range of instruments of transparency and outreach available to the system , they have been key partners of the system in balancing country-specific interests , and advancing , at both the national and the international levels , the United Nations systems economic , social and human rights agenda .  
They especially appreciated the fact that the concept put forward by the Secretary-General that we must put people at the centre of everything we do was strongly reflected in the United Nations Millennium Declaration ; the Summits reference to the United Nations as the indispensable common house of the entire human family ; and its wish to make the United Nations system a more vital and effective tool in the hands of all the worlds peoples .  
Agencies will thus provide their technical expertise according to their respective mandates following the themes of the round tables : HIV / AIDS prevention and care ; HIV / AIDS and human rights ; the social and economic impact of the epidemic and the strengthening of national capacities to combat HIV / AIDS ; and international funding and cooperation to address the challenges of the AIDS epidemic .  
The attitude of the Congolese people , as reflected by a wide range of civil society organizations , religious groups and opposition political parties whom the Council mission met in Kinshasa and elsewhere , suggests that the country is eager to move forward towards national reconciliation , democratization and development , with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in a climate of political plurality .  
The key tasks were : to ensure security during the transitional period and arrangements for East Timors post-independence security ; to establish a credible system of justice in which fundamental human rights are respected ; to achieve a reasonable level of reconstruction of public services and infrastructure ; to establish an administration that is financially sustainable ; and to manage a political transition to independence , culminating in the adoption of a constitution and democratic elections ( see S / 2000 / 738 , para .  68 ) .  
UNTAET essentially faced many challenges with regard to public administration , among which was , first , the rapid establishment of a functioning administrative apparatus within a context of decimated human and material infrastructure , and second , moving East Timorese into positions of responsibility as soon and as much as possible to create a sustainable East Timorese administration ( Timorization ) .  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .  
In the relevant letters addressed to you on a regular basis by its Minister for Foreign Affairs , Iraq has always stressed that the logistic support provided to the Americans and British by Kuwait makes that country a partner in the aggression committed against Iraq and that it thus incurs international responsibility under international law , including liability for full compensation for the losses and damage , in both human and material terms , that are caused by this aggression .  
Noting that the effective functioning of national TCDC focal points and the full utilization of the TCDC modality , require , inter alia , adequate financial and human resources , as well as international support ,  
As development thinking shifts towards sustainable human development and parallel good governance and economic development , South-South initiatives are required to move easily from technical collaboration to joint efforts in social and economic development .  
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
In the light of the International Bill of Rights , poverty may be defined as a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
While poverty raises complex multisectoral issues that are not amenable to simple solutions , the application of the international human rights normative framework to these issues helps to ensure that essential elements of anti-poverty strategies such as non-discrimination , equality , participation and accountability receive the sustained attention they deserve .  
In conclusion , anti-poverty policies are more likely to be effective , sustainable , inclusive , equitable and meaningful to those living in poverty if they are based upon international human rights .  
The challenge of building functioning institutions safeguarding fundamental human rights and capable of supporting a multi-ethnic society based on democratic principles and tolerance is a major one .  
The development of an indigenous technological base will provide developing countries with the knowledge and skills necessary for the optimal use of their own human and natural resources and help in devising the production techniques relevant to their development strategies and cultural milieu .  
I am also concerned at the deterioration in public security , reflected in an increase in crime , in actions by armed criminal groups and in the continuing very serious threats against persons involved in criminal proceedings and intimidation of members of non-governmental human rights organizations .  
Although it was reported at the end of December 2000 that the Executive Director had delegated programme managerial responsibilities to ODCCP programme managers and that they would be held accountable for the implementation of programme activities and the efficient use of human and financial resources , at the time of the inspection OIOS found no documentary evidence specifying the parameters of such delegation and the mechanism of accountability .  
The Workshop underlined the importance of indigenous media as an indispensable tool to promote indigenous identity , language , culture , self-representation and collective and human rights , and as a vehicle for communicating international , regional and national issues to indigenous communities as well as conveying community concerns to a wider public .  
Article 55 of the Charter explicitly recognizes that solutions to international economic , social , health and related problems , international , cultural and educational cooperation and universal respect for human rights are all essential for the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
In 1997 , as part of my programme for reform , I established a structure of four executive committees at the Under-Secretary-General level to act as internal decision-making mechanisms for the five main areas of concern : peace and security ; economic and social affairs ; development cooperation ; humanitarian affairs ; and human rights as a cross-cutting theme .  
Examples of this include improving support for democratic principles such as a fair role for the opposition , equitable access to public media , security sector reform , promoting tolerance and respect for human rights and providing technical assistance for the constitution and national institutions .  
Efforts to prevent armed conflict should promote a broad range of human rights , including not only civil and political rights but also economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
This implies an increased focus on issues like good governance at national and international levels and the fight against corruption , respect for all internationally recognized human rights , gender issues , capacity and institutional building , social services supply and environmental concerns .  The majority of the poor live in rural areas .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
At its forty-seventh session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1995 / 31 , endorsed the background document of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 11 ) and requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on the impact of the activities and working methods of transnational corporations on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , bearing in mind existing international guidelines , rules and standards relating to the subject matter .  
The Sub-Commission decided , in response to the request from the Commission , and since this subject required careful and comprehensive inquiry , to appoint Mr . Oloka-Onyango and Ms . Udagama as Special Rapporteurs with the task of preparing a study on the issue of globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , and requested the Special Rapporteurs to submit a preliminary report to the Sub-Commission at its fifty-second session .  
HIV / AIDS is now a classic , modern health issue , closely connected with individual and collective human behaviour , strongly influenced by broad social and economic forces and linked particularly closely to social discrimination .  
In the Millennium Declaration , the heads of State and Government of the States Members of the United Nations pledged to spare no effort to free our fellow men , women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty , to which more than a-billion of them are currently subjected and expressed their commitment to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want ( General Assembly resolution 55 / 2 of 8 September 2000 , para . 
In 2001 , OHCHR has also assisted the independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty in the preparation and conduct of her mission to Bolivia to assess the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes and strategies by meeting with government officials , representatives of non-governmental organizations and poor peoples associations , as well as United Nations and international financial organizations in the country .  
The expert seminar acknowledged the need for a new text that would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of poverty , and in particular extreme poverty , that would clarify definitional issues through the multidimensional nature of poverty in the light of human rights , and that would set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
In May 2001 , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights adopted a statement on poverty which recognizes that poverty constitutes a denial of human rights and defines poverty as a human condition characterized by the deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ( A / CONF . 191 / BP / 7 ) .  
This does not guarantee that particular measures of affirmative action will survive all constitutional challenges , but the propriety of affirmative action under international treaty law of the United States and related duties provide compelling State interests and can contribute to a continuing or evolving meaning of the Constitution compatible with generally shared values and human dignity .  
Moreover , a genuine operation is under way to influence world opinion in order to accomplish unacknowledged goals : continuing to occupy Congolese territory , massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , pillage and illegal exploitation of Congolese resources .  
Deeply concerned that the global HIV / AIDS epidemic , through its devastating scale and impact , constitutes a global emergency and one of the most formidable challenges to human life and dignity , as well as to the effective enjoyment of human rights , which undermines social and economic development throughout the world and affects all levels of society national , community , family and individual ;  
Recognizing the fundamental importance of strengthening national , regional and subregional capacities to address and effectively combat HIV / AIDS and that this will require increased and sustained human , financial and technical resources through strengthened national action and cooperation and increased regional , subregional and international cooperation ;  
Protecting public health and nutrition , protecting the environment , encouraging technology transfer , advancing socio-economic development as stated in article 7 of the TRIPS Agreement , and promoting fairness and international cooperation are measures that - at least in theory - are conducive to the promotion and protection of human rights and the balance sought under article 15 .  
In resolution 1999 / 26 of 26 August 1999 , the Sub-Commission expressed its deep appreciation and thanks to the Special Rapporteur for her excellent and comprehensive preliminary report and requested the Secretary-General to transmit this report to Governments , specialized agencies and concerned intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations with the request that they submit to the Special Rapporteur as soon as possible comments , information and data relating to the study on terrorism and human rights .  
Its main purpose is to move ahead and explore other priority areas touched upon in the earlier documents prepared by the Special Rapporteur , namely the problem of definition and of the actors involved in the exercise or use of terrorist activity , the development of new forms of terrorism and the probability of mass destruction terrorism and , finally , a number of issues associated with the consequences of terrorism for human rights .  
It reiterated its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for economic and social development .  
It is , moreover , well-understood that the illegal use of force in international relations will be considered under customary international law , international human rights and humanitarian law , the law of armed conflict and international criminal law .  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
In similar fashion , better efforts should be made to achieve improved relations between States , not only because this is mandated in the Charter , but also because it is viewed as essential to the global realization of human rights as indicated in article 28 of the Universal Declaration : quite clearly an international order that is generating terrorist acts hardly qualifies as a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in th [ e ] Declaration can be fully realized . 
We recognize and admit that slavery and the slave trade , other forms of servitude , conquest and colonialism were the primary sources and manifestation / a source of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and condemn the injustices that were committed , especially against Africans , people of African descent and indigenous peoples and stress the need for all States which were engaged in such practices to acknowledge the grave human suffering they caused and the heinous racist acts committed ;  
We affirm that slavery , particularly of Africans and their descendants , and especially the transatlantic slave trade , was a unique and appalling tragedy in the history of humanity and a crime against humanity , not only because of its abhorrent barbarism , but also in terms of its enormous magnitude , its institutionalized nature , its transnational dimension and especially its negation of the very essence of the human nature of its victims ;  
We express our deep concern that socio-economic development is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
Refugees and displaced persons already for many years have been deprived of elementary living conditions and the exercise of the most fundamental human rights and freedoms , enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , including the right to live in dignity and safety and participate fully in social and economic life in their places of permanent residence .  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
We firmly believe that education , development and the faithful implementation of our international human rights norms / obligations , including enactment of laws and political , social and economic policies , are crucial to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We express deep concern about the use of new information technologies , such as the Internet , for purposes contrary to respect for human values , equality , non-discrimination , respect for others and tolerance , including to propagate racism , racial hatred , xenophobia , racial discrimination and related intolerance , and that children and youth have access to this material ; others / [ respect and tolerance for diversity ] ; [ and urge their continued and enhanced use in this respect ; ] .  
We recognize that quality education , the elimination of illiteracy and access to free general education for all should promote more inclusive societies , equity , stable and harmonious relations and friendship between nations , peoples and groups , and a culture of peace , fostering mutual understanding , solidarity , social justice and respect for the human rights of all ;  
Stress that education and training programmes , as well as other social policies , should promote more inclusive societies , encouraging stable and harmonious relationships and friendships between different nations , peoples and groups , fostering mutual understanding , solidarity , tolerance , the development of a culture of peace , the study of the Holocaust and injustice against indigenous peoples and people of African descent in the Americas , social justice and respect for human rights for all ;  
Urges States , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to take steps to improve access to public information on health and environmental issues by all people , including those affected by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; identify and address the adverse effects of government policies and programmes on the human health and environment in targeted areas ; and promote compliance with and enforcement of all health and environmental laws , including in areas inhabited by racial or ethnic minorities , indigenous peoples , or low-income populations ;  
In this regard , it is important to introduce and , as applicable , to reinforce an / the anti-discrimination and anti-racism components / into human rights programmes in school curricula , to develop relevant educational material and to ensure that all teachers are effectively trained and adequately motivated to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns , etc .  / of the school curricula and to improve educational materials on human rights and anti-racism , in order to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns based on the principles of non-discrimination , mutual respect and tolerance ;  
Calls upon Calls uponStrongly recommends to participating States to introduce , or encourage the introduction of , or reinforce , human rights education , including promoting anti-racism , with a view to combating prejudices which lead to racial discrimination and to promoting understanding , tolerance and friendship between different racial or ethnic groups in school curricula and in institutions of higher education and to support public formal and non-formal education programmes designed to promote cultural diversity and self-esteem of vulnerable groups ;  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism ;  
Action is required at all levels national , regional and worldwide and in many areas : disarmament , peacekeeping and peace-building , combating organized crime , ensuring the responsibility of producer and consumer States , without forgetting the need , in parallel , to pursue the whole range of actions to prevent and combat the underlying causes of conflicts .  For the moment , a single aim must nevertheless inspire us , that of responding to the problem of human suffering and insecurity .  
Many years had to elapse and great human and material resources had to be expended for the world to realize something that should have been an obvious truth ; that the early identification of trends leading to crises and the timely forestalling of their development into armed clashes are much more effective in every respect than extinguishing conflicts in their heated phase .  
The Board also took into consideration in its selection that the Group had decided to keep under consideration at its twenty-sixth session the question of debt bondage , the role of corruption in the perpetuation of slavery and slavery-like practices , problems affecting migrant workers , the protection of child labourers , forced labour , trafficking in human organs and tissues , forced marriages , ways to combat sexual abuse of children inside the family , and the urgent need for adequate help to be offered to victims of such practices .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
India pointed to the urgent need for a comprehensive study on the impact of terrorism on the enjoyment of human rights , in view of the continuing acts of terrorism despite international and national efforts , and the still confused and inconclusive debate on the issue .  
In the field of human rights , the ILO has continued to collaborate with other international organizations on issues such as freedom of association , discrimination in employment and occupation , equal opportunities of men and women in employment , indigenous and tribal peoples , migrant workers , forced labour , child labour , and other questions falling within the mandate of ILO .  
Because of common purposes and objectives ( education and training ) , similar geographic and human target areas , similar operational modes and strategies and a common institutional location , there are large areas of synergetic opportunity between the programmes : funding , management and execution , cost rationalization - let alone the added value of a comprehensive and integrated approach to commercial and logistic manpower requirements .  
The Special Committee therefore regards this regional seminar as a critical first step in this second International Decade , as we proceed to devise international strategies in a concerted effort to ensure that this sacred right to self-determination , this basic human right , is realized in all of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , so that the people might achieve their full political equality consistent with recognized international standards . 
In the above-mentioned resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on human rights and cultural diversity , taking into account the views of Member States , relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , as well as the considerations in the resolution regarding the recognition and importance of cultural diversity among all peoples ; and decided to continue consideration of the question at its fifty-sixth session under the item entitled Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It implies a commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the rights of groups that are disadvantaged or victims of discrimination and persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and cultural minorities to have free access to the expression of their own culture and that of others .  
There is no choice therefore but to condemn and demand the immediate repeal of laws of this kind adopted by the Government of the United States of America , such as the so-called Helms-Burton Act and the Torricelli Act , which are a direct attack on the enjoyment of human rights by the Cuban people , are incompatible with World Trade Organization ( WTO ) agreements and undermine ongoing efforts to make the multilateral trading system more equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable .  
Also urges States to protect the privacy of those subject to genetic testing and to ensure that genetic testing is done with the prior , free , informed and express consent of the individual or authorization obtained in the manner prescribed by law and in accordance with public international law and the international law of human rights ;  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
The definition tries to capture the dimension of human suffering that is missing from many formal descriptions of food insecurity : the unbearable , nagging dread that tortures starving persons from the moment they wake up .  How , during the day that lies ahead , will they be able to feed their family , provide nourishment for their children and feed themselves ?  
The terrible dimension of human suffering , so often missing from formal descriptions of food insecurity , is the unbearable , nagging dread that tortures undernourished persons from the moment they wake up .  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
Convinced that human rights education and information is in the best interests of particularly vulnerable segments of society , such as children , youth , women , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with HIV / AIDs and disabled persons ,  
The Unit otherwise supports the work of NGOs by disseminating international human rights promotional and training material and developing a mechanism through which information collated and analysed by the Unit and East Timorese NGOs will be preserved and accessible for future use .  
Noting with grave concern that despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination had not been attained , the General Assembly decided that the World Conference would be action-oriented and focus on practical measures to eradicate racism , including measures of prevention , education and protection and the provision of effective remedies , taking into full consideration the existing human rights instruments .  
Also urges States to protect the privacy of those subject to genetic testing and to ensure that genetic testing is done with the prior , free , informed and express consent of the individual or authorization obtained in the manner prescribed by law and in accordance with public international law and the international law of human rights ;  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
That being so , although at one time the definition was considered to be a first step , the current tendency is to describe it as partial , inadequate , applying only to international conflicts and inapplicable to new approaches such as the one involving the criminal responsibility of artificial persons ( private security firms ) that hire and employ mercenaries who violate human rights .  
All this may give rise to interference by mercenaries who , motivated by payment , may commit terrorist acts , attacks against persons , cultural objects or economic facilities , engage in illicit trafficking , or provoke armed or other conflicts with a view to carrying out violent and destabilizing assignments which have a profound impact on the enjoyment of human rights .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the prevailing rules of international humanitarian law and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the supreme chief of the Taliban , asking him not to issue the decree because of its discriminatory nature and stressing that measures designed to protect minorities must be consistent with the relevant international human rights standards , which were based on the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of religion or belief .  
The Preparatory Committee drew up a list of participants in the conference , including all Member States of the United Nations and observers , the various related components of the United Nations secretariat , specialized agencies , UNESCO chairs in the field of human rights and interreligious dialogue , treaty and non-treaty human rights mechanisms regional organizations , international organizations of an educational or cultural nature , national and regional human rights institutes , national human rights commissions , and experts from religious or confessional groups and non-governmental organizations .  
With a view to achieving deeper cooperation and better mutual understanding and to promoting the exchange of expertise , the Special Rapporteur decided to invite to the Madrid conference United Nations human rights mechanisms ( such as those relating to special procedures , treaty monitoring bodies and national human rights institutions ) , as well as United Nations specialized agencies concerned with questions of education and freedom of religion or belief .  
One might therefore consider that action for the promotion of human rights should involve , on the one hand , action for the establishment , consolidation and protection of democracy , as an expression of human rights on the political level , and , on the other , action aimed at limiting and reducing extreme poverty and promoting the rights of individuals and peoples to development , as an expression of human rights and of economic , social and cultural solidarity among human beings .  
It is at that level that , most immediately , priorities can be identified , successful and flexible response strategies determined ( including through international cooperation ) and assistance given to States , in the human rights context and within the international and regional human rights frameworks .  
These should be , and in many cases are already being , applied by national Governments ( including in developing their international policies and objectives ) to ensure , through exercising good governance , that their citizens are involved in decision-making , that their citizens rights are protected and that all areas of government are sensitized to human rights obligations and goals .  
Moreover there is the danger that by increasing the inequalities between rich and poor countries , globalization may render the exercise of the most elementary and fundamental human rights illusory in the least developed countries , whose numbers have grown steadily since 1990 and whose economic situation has steadily deteriorated , further pauperizing a population already sorely tried by various disasters .  
There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
To promote and defend human rights it is essential , in this regard , to promote equitable trade among nations , to establish a minimum of control in commercial exchanges , to reorient globalization and focus more on the human being rather than on profit , to strengthen regional integration processes as a shield against the disastrous effects of globalization and to break the vicious circle of indebtedness of developing countries .  
In that regard , Finland has actively supported the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative with the aim to have the developing countries commit themselves to the exercise of sustainable economic policies , alleviation of poverty and respect for human rights in return for a reduced debt burden .  
Those rights concern historical , cultural and ethnic identity , the juridical identity of indigenous communities , communal possession of traditional lands , bilingual and intercultural education , the preservation of indigenous heritage , measures to promote human development and participation in the management of their natural resources .  6 .  Argentina has established a National Institute against Discrimination , Xenophobia and Racism , a decentralized body within the framework of the Ministry of the Interior .  
Even though the right to development as set out in the 1986 Declaration was reaffirmed in the 1993 Vienna Declaration as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , several industrialized countries are now attempting to question and reformulate its content and scope , including the definition of the beneficiaries of the right .  
The Government of the Republic of Cuba is confident that human solidarity and social justice will prevail over the selfish and unjust concepts underpinning the current international economic order , which are aggravated by the neo-liberal theories imposed by the current process of globalization .  
Training programmes and discussions aimed at both rural women and men to promote gender awareness should be organized by national and local governments , human rights groups and other non-governmental organizations in order to encourage the sharing of parental roles and domestic duties by men .  
Following the establishment of the Republic of Yemen in 1990 , which ushered in an era of democratization and active civil institutions , the number of non-governmental organizations and institutions engaged in activities relating to the protection and promotion of human rights in general or focusing on a particular field , such as political , civil , economic or cultural rights or protection of the rights of a specific section of society , such as women , children or the disabled , increased considerably and currently amounts to about 2,000 .  
The principal objectives of the Network are to expand mutual support , cooperation and joint activities , including through information exchanges , training and development , undertaking joint projects , sharing expertise , periodical regional meetings and seminars , and mutually assisting each other with respect to requests from other national institutions regarding human rights violations .  
The Special Adviser attended the seventh annual Congress of the International Ombudsperson Institute held in Durban , South Africa , from 30 October to 2 November 2000 , where the participating Ombudspersons and national institutions agreed that living in a society that pursues good governance practices is a basic human right .  59 .  An increasing number of national institutions take the opportunity of addressing the Commission on Human Rights in its annual sessions .  
As per the respective Commission on Human Rights resolutions , Member States of the United Nations are encouraged to continue supporting the efforts of the Office in this area and to provide additional financial resources as part of their contributions to the programme of advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights .  
Recruitment and use of child soldiers , the proliferation of small arms , the indiscriminate use of landmines , large-scale forced displacement and ethnic cleansing , the targeting of women and children , the denial of even the most basic human rights , and widespread impunity for atrocities are still all too familiar features of war .  
I urge the Security Council and the General Assembly to provide , from the outset , reliable , sufficient and sustained funding for international efforts , whether existing or future international tribunals , arrangements established in the context of United Nations peace operations , or initiatives undertaken in concert with individual Member States , to bring to justice perpetrators of grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
Concrete and verified information about massive displacements of people , security conditions , and violations of international humanitarian and human rights law can be vital for distressed populations and international aid workers alike .  Where communications are disrupted , using the media to inform distressed populations about the activities of relief agencies , and about the location of shelter , food , water and medical services , can be critical for alleviating human suffering .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .

I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
At its fifty-seventh session , in April 2001 , the Commission on Human Rights adopted , without a vote , resolution 2001 / 13 on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan , in which it strongly condemned the mass killings and systematic human rights violations against civilians and persons deprived of their liberty , for reasons related to the armed conflict , resulting in the massive , forced displacement of the civilian population .  
It also noted with deep concern the continuing pattern of human rights violations in Afghanistan and the continuation of armed hostilities and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which had resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement .  
In view of the repeated massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Afghanistan , the High Commissioner called upon the international community to establish an independent international inquiry into the massacres and other grave human rights violations committed by parties to the armed conflict in Afghanistan .  
He expressed his dismay at the persistent failure of the warring parties to abide by international humanitarian norms and to hold those responsible for gross violations of human rights accountable for their actions .  
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan stated in his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session that , in order to deter and prevent the occurrence of such atrocities , an effective international initiative was needed to expose and hold to account those responsible for war crimes , breaches of international humanitarian law and gross violations of human rights .  
The previous report noted that the situation was worsening year by year , and described challenges in the area of sustainable human development resulting from the chronic instability of the countrys political , economic , social and security environment .  
Quality of life is declining in urban areas , with losses of housing and of human lives caused by erosion , siltation and flooding ; general insalubrity owing to the lack of appropriate solid and liquid waste management systems ; severe overcrowding caused both by the population explosion and by uncontrollable concentrations of population ; physical and chemical degradation of land ; pollution of all kinds ; and above all , deforestation on the periphery of urban areas . 
Finally , in cooperation with OHCHR , UNEP is organizing a seminar on environment and human rights to discuss interlinkages , common protection approaches , the special role played by some groups and their vulnerability , and proposals for future courses of action at the national and international level .  
Such projects have included peoples sensitization campaigns on indigenous people issues in Chile ; training sessions for school teachers and representatives of social groups in Chile ; the establishment of a centre in Mexico where human rights violations can be reported and which provides legal assistance to vulnerable groups , such as rural populations , street children , prisoners and people living with HIV / AIDS . France Liberts has also been advocating against the death penalty ; a CD-ROM against racism was also produced and distributed among schools and for public awareness purposes . 
The Plan of Action for the Decade provides for the establishment , upon the initiative of Governments or other relevant institutions , of national focal points or committees for human rights education , which should include a broad coalition of governmental and non-governmental actors and be responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive , effective and sustainable national plan of action for human rights education .  
When applicable , this plan should constitute an integral part of the national development plan and be complementary to other relevant national plans of action already defined ( overall human rights plans or those relating to women , children , minorities , indigenous peoples , etc . ) .  
At the national level , the Service Centre for Human Rights Education , established in 1997 , continues to provide systematic assistance and advice to school teachers on human rights issues , including the development of special projects and of a newsletter .  Anti-racism educational efforts were also reported .  
The main characteristic of the period under review has been the large number of complaints of threats , harassment and intimidation against persons and institutions working for the protection of human rights , civil servants , persons involved in judicial proceedings and journalists critical of public authorities .  
The end of the internal armed conflict and of an institutional policy that violated human rights represented a qualitative and quantitative improvement .  
It is the States inability to safeguard human rights that has made the public feel defenceless and has increased tolerance for illegal , increasingly violent phenomena such as lynchings and social cleansing .  
Although by and large , these commitments are in the form of best endeavour , they mark a significant departure from the previous two programmes of action by clearly indicating complementary actions between least developed countries and their development partners in seven areas : fostering a people-centred policy framework ; good governance at national and international levels ; building human and institutional capacities ; building productive capacities to make globalization work for least developed countries ; enhancing the role of trade in development ; reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment ; and mobilizing financial resources .  
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
The promotion of a conducive macroeconomic environment , good governance and democracy , as well as strengthening structural aspects of the economy and improved institutional and human capacities , was regarded as important also in the context of attracting FDI and other private external flows .  
The Section will be responsible for mid - and long-term planning , including succession planning , developing mission modules / templates , determining staffing tables and levels , anticipating future skills requirements , analysing and monitoring human resource trends , identifying new sources of recruitment , and managing the civilian rapid deployment capability .  
Bearing in mind also that both the legislative and oversight organs of the Organization have stressed the importance of having in place an effective monitoring mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the delegated authority for the management of human resources in peacekeeping operations , it is proposed to strengthen Cluster VI by two additional Professional ( 1 P-5 , 1-P-4 ) and one General Service ( Other level ) posts . 
Attacks against the civilian population and systematic killings and summary executions have been a part of the pattern of egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law perpetrated by different factions in the protracted armed conflict in Sierra Leone .  
To standardize police training and adapt it to the Sierra Leone environment , the Section has finalized arrangements with the UNAMSIL Civilian Police to produce a training manual for the police , internal human rights awareness training for incoming UNAMSIL peacekeepers and military observers occurs on a regular basis and the Section provided training on human rights and humanitarian law for the Pakistani Brigade in Pakistan prior to its deployment to UNAMSIL .  
In order to enable OHCHR to provide adequate , systematic and prompt substantive support and to facilitate links with the broader United Nations human rights programme , there is a need to strengthen its capacity for daily advice and substantive backstopping to the increasing number of peacekeeping operations with human rights components .  
A number of interventions recalled article 1 of the Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986 , which stated that The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
He recognized that certain development activities in the past had had negative impacts on indigenous peoples such as involuntary resettlement , restricted access to natural resources and violations of basic human rights .  
In the opinion of Qatar , the right of peoples to self-determination is one of the most important ones acquired in the field of human rights , yet ongoing occupation is unquestionably impeding the development of international economic cooperation , preventing the social and cultural advancement of peoples subjected to occupation and negating the ideal of universal peace to which the United Nations is aspiring .  
Mindful that , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Supports the Declaration on the Right to Development and underlines the multidimensional , integrated and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations on achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination or distinction as to race , colour , sex , social class , descent , national or ethnic origin , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recalling that the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups must be respected in all circumstances and that deliberate policies discriminating against women and girls in that country on the grounds of sex constitute gross and flagrant violations of the international instruments relating to human rights ,  
Stressing that , in accordance with article 27 , paragraph 2 , of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 15 , paragraph 1 ( c ) , of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the right to protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific , literary or artistic production of which one is the author is a human right , subject to limitations in the public interest ,  
In addition , Article 1 calls for achieving international cooperation to solve international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The Government of Panama , whose foreign policy is fully engaged in the development of the democratic system and respect for human rights throughout the world , believes that the continued exclusion of the Republic of China from the United Nations system is inconsistent with the principles that underlie the Organizations functioning , the commitment to the democratic system and human rights that the United Nations system proclaims and promotes , and the international realities witnessed by all the peoples of the world .  
After so many years of fruitless endeavours , the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations , in particular the Security Council , might wish to consider adopting a comprehensive approach to the settlement of Afghanistan , in its political , military , humanitarian and human rights dimensions , setting forth the basic requirements for a settlement of the conflict and the principles on which it should be based , together with a coherent strategy to resolve the conflict .  
The General Assembly reaffirmed the responsibility of Governments to safeguard and protect the rights of migrants against illegal or violent acts , in particular acts of racial discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals or groups , and urged them to reinforce measures in that regard ; urged all States to adopt effective measures to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and detention of migrants , including by individuals or groups ; and called upon all States to protect the human rights of migrant children , in particular unaccompanied migrant children .  
Among the most significant aspects , the Government emphasized the importance given to the effective implementation of international accords on the matter , the fact that a lack of internal legislation should not hinder the protection of internationally recognized human rights , the provision of non-discrimination and equality of all persons , and the adoption of sanctions against the abuse and ill-treatment of certain vulnerable groups .  
The Special Rapporteur is pleased to report that , since the ongoing transitional process began , there have been apparent some substantial signals indicative of the Governments inclination to engage in a constructive dialogue on human rights .  
Reiterates its call to Member States to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and in this regard urges them to provide the necessary human , material and financial resources for timely and preventive measures including early warning , preventive diplomacy , preventive deployment , practical disarmament measures and peace-building as appropriate in each case ;  
The Committee reminds the State party that even during armed conflict , fundamental human rights must be respected and that basic economic , social and cultural rights as part of the minimum standards of human rights are guaranteed under customary international law and are also prescribed by international humanitarian law .  
Takes note with satisfaction of the continuing efforts of developing countries , particularly those in African countries , to combat malaria through the formulation of plans and strategies at the national , regional and continental levels , despite their limited financial , technical and human resources ;  
The recommendations called upon Governments to sign and ratify relevant international instruments on migrant workers ; develop bilateral and multilateral agreements with a view to raising awareness and ensuring the protection of the human rights of women migrant workers ; and to provide training to immigration , police and consular officers on the proper handling of cases of violence against women migrant workers .  
Governments of countries of origin were called upon to develop comprehensive migration policies to facilitate safe and protected migratory movements of women and protect womens human rights ; to organize pre-departure courses for migrants and licensed recruitment agencies ; to monitor practices of recruitment agents ; and to develop mechanisms to assist women through diplomatic and consular posts in receiving countries .  
In terms of its real meaning , it bespoke a balance of terror , a cold-war calculation that the physical security and ultimate fate of hundreds of millions of human beings had to be held hostage to the prospect of instant annihilation .  
It had endorsed the two major international human rights covenants , was currently drafting a basic law on the guarantee of human rights and had shared with many countries the benefits of its outstanding achievements in economic development , agriculture , global trade and information and communications technology .  
It was a simple request for participation in the work of the United Nations by a State with impressive economic achievements and an exemplary human rights record , which had made laudable efforts in the field of national and economic assistance and technical cooperation .  
In its foreign policy , the Democratic Republic of the Congo understands that the use of force can not settle the problems confronting the world today and that in the struggle against terrorism there is a need to create a universal conscience and a universal union that can eliminate this scourge and others that threaten the very survival of the human race .  It is for this reason that my country has signed and ratified several global conventions dealing with the question of international terrorism .  
The manifestations of that daily horror are daily massacres of the civilian population , summary and extrajudicial executions , the deportation of entire populations , the taking of hostages , hijacking , the illegal capture and destruction of aircraft , the systematic rape and burying alive of women , destitution , other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , the deliberate and criminal spread of HIV / AIDS , and so forth .  
In the most unfortunate situations , the State apparatus , unable to cope with the security challenge posed by terrorism , is forced to take draconian measures to counter it , with an inevitable impact on civic and human rights .  
My country felt that it itself had been struck to its foundations , as did all States whose institutions rest on democratic principles , respect for the human person and the rule of law , values upon which our societies are based , as is the international community gathered at the United Nations . Its commitment to defending those values is therefore absolute .  
It is no exaggeration to say that the world situation is complex and difficult in view of the fact that our world today is rife with international conflicts that we have not been able to settle and chronic crises awaiting solutions that would break the spiral of violence and suffering threatening our human existence .  
It is an act that flagrantly violated a basic , fundamental right on which is based the functioning and entire legal , political , moral and religious structure of our societies and of human coexistence : respect for the right to life of every human being . 
In summary , let me state that we the peoples of the United Nations should be determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of terrorism ; to reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained ; and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom .  
The Secretary-General has also recommended the Member States ensure that their military , civilian and police personnel involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations be trained with regard to international human rights , humanitarian law and refugee law , especially as concerns the rights and protection of children and women , in advance of troop deployment to United Nations operations .  
After much discussion , the principles of juvenile justice were retained within the statute of the Special Court and it was determined that if a person between 15 and 18 years of age at the time of the alleged commission of the crime comes before the Court , he or she shall be treated with dignity and a sense of worth , and in accordance with international human rights standards .  
He laid out the following five areas which Japan attached maximum priority in providing its assistance : ( i ) poverty reduction and social development ; ( ii ) human resources development and capacity-building for policy formulation and implementation ; ( iii ) fostering the LDCs private sector ; ( iv ) democratization ; and , ( v ) reduction of debt-burden .  
The key to attaining this objective lies in taking measures geared to halting and reversing the deterioration of physical infrastructure in landlocked and transit developing countries , continuing support for policy , legislative and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , including coordinated and collaborative human resource development , and enhancing international cooperation . 
For more than 50 years now , we have struggled to find ways to achieve that measure of global political coherence required to survive the grave risks posed by weapons of mass destruction , thermonuclear bombs foremost among them , whose blasts are thousands of times more powerful than those of 11 September arsenals that could lead to human extinction .  
The Inter-American Democratic Charter represents an important initiative , promoted by Peru , and reflects regional consensus on an unprecedented instrument which systematizes principles , norms and mechanisms for collective action , including diplomatic sanctions in cases of alteration or interruption of democratic institutionality , with a view to promoting , preserving and defending democracy from a human rights perspective .  
The mission , which had met with government representatives and a broad cross section of humanitarian partners and visited internally displaced persons locations in Bi , Huambo and Luanda provinces , expressed concern over allegations of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law , including forced relocation , targeting of civilians , forced conscription , looting of humanitarian supplies and sexual violence .  
The United States was committed to continuing and increasing support for sustainable economic growth and human development , accompanied by steady poverty reduction .  
In the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the Special Representative recognized that any assessment of the current human rights situation must take into account the degraded economic and social situation that was inherited by the democratically elected administration in October 2000 .  
In particular , he identified three areas of ongoing concern : the human rights situation and physical protection of ethnic minority communities in Kosovo ; the quality of the rule of law , including the independence of the judiciary ; and the extent to which human rights standards are reflected and integrated into the policies and practices of UNMIK and KFOR . 
He also recognizes that progress has been made in addressing a number of historical human rights violations committed by the former government prior to October 2000 , including the release of many political prisoners , investigations into the fate of persons of different ethnic groups missing during the armed conflict in Kosovo in 1999 and criminal investigations into murdered or other disappeared persons .  
He believes that a critical objective of the entire process of institutional reform must be an effective separation of legislative , executive and judicial powers with human rights and the rule of law as its foundation .  
My delegation believes that security is a subject that is not linked to international peace and security alone , but encompasses a series of elements within a multisectoral framework that , in addition to security , includes the commitment to promote democracy and full respect for human rights , to battle crime and illicit drugs , and to foster overall social and economic development in a harmonious way .  
In that Opinion , the Court stated that , given the unique characteristics of those weapons , in particular their destructive capacity , their capacity to cause untold human suffering , and their ability to cause damage to generations to come , the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be a potential catastrophe .  
Structural adjustment programmes have not had the expected outcome , and the Trade and Development Board , while welcoming the new emphasis of such programmes on poverty reduction , encourages continued attention to be paid to external factors as well as to shortcomings of domestic markets and enterprises , human capital and physical infrastructure , institutions and income distribution . 
The majority of those in academic circles who dealt with the issue of terrorism shared the opinion that terrorism meant the following : the use of or threat to use violence for political purposes ; a method of fighting or reaching specific goals based on intimidation of a society and government by causing human casualties and loss of property , characterized by ruthlessness and violation of moral and legal norms .  
The proposed operational and logistics base would be established at Kindu , which is located at the western fringe of an area characterized by many of the military , security , political and humanitarian and human rights problems that MONUC is likely to be confronted with in phase III .  
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .  
The use of coercive measures as a means of political and economic compulsion , whether unilaterally or under the auspices of regional and international organizations , poses a genuine threat to international peace and security and is in manifest violation of human rights principles .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Pope John Paul II , on 13 September , in accepting the credentials of the new Ambassador of the United States to the Holy See , said , In facing the challenges of the future , America is called to cherish and live out the deepest values of her national heritage : solidarity and cooperation between peoples ; respect for human rights ; the justice that is the indispensable condition for authentic freedom and lasting peace .  
Poverty , along with other situations of marginalization that engulf the lives of so many of the worlds people , including the denial of human dignity , the lack of respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms , social dislocation , intolerable refugee situations , internal and external displacement and physical and psychological oppression , are breeding grounds just waiting to be exploited by terrorists .  
Effective development strategies and economic and social sustainability depended on enhanced national capacity to operate within a comprehensive framework that reflected the interdependence of macroeconomic and financial issues with structural , social and human concerns , including environment and health . 
In the developing countries generally , limited infrastructure , inadequate regulatory systems , access costs and lack of human resources were serious handicaps to connectivity and the use of information and communication technologies , which were , moreover , not geared to their languages or their social and cultural contexts . 
The Centre will advocate , promote , monitor and assess the progress made by combining best practices and enabling policies , and compiling legislation and plans of action for the identification of illustrative cities for the two global campaigns and further advancing the normative debate and operational action on major human settlements issues .  
The problem of the illicit traffic in and the circulation of small arms and light weapons within the region of Southeastern Europe is of particular concern for the Republic of Macedonia , especially after the 1997 civilian unrest in Albania and the conflict in Kosovo ; it poses a serious threat not only to the security and stability of my country but to the broader region as well , particularly through its severe , adverse impact on economic , social and human development .  
His delegation called for the strengthening of regional and international mechanisms designed to contain conflicts and their destructive consequences , curb the factors that led to their outbreak and prosecute those responsible for acts involving human rights violations , terrorism , trafficking of drugs and prohibited weapons , organized crime and money-laundering , among others .  
On instructions from His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan , President of the United Arab Emirates , to make the individual in that State the pivot and the purpose of national development endeavours , the State had adopted legislation , policies and plans aimed at developing national human resources through the development and modernization of educational , health and cultural institutions and the establishment of centres to train young people and develop their scientific and technological skills in accordance with national development needs .  
The Task Force is responsible for : ( a ) recommending initiatives or actions which will lead to the establishment of a common service or the reinforcement of an existing one ; ( b ) reviewing proposals and recommendations put forward by the working groups on common services ; and ( c ) defining the degree of commitment of cooperation , participation and human and financial resources required from participating organizations .  
The involvement of the League is expected to provide the needed political support to advance the objective of the UNDP regional programme on governance with emphasis on strengthening parliaments , supporting frameworks for financial transparency and accountability , improving the administration of justice and promoting human rights .  
However , it does not meet the basic requirements , demanded of national human rights institutes , namely a founding constitutional or legislative text , independent appointment procedures and a pluralist and representative membership .  
Today aggression , intervention , interference in the internal affairs of other States , occupation of other countries territories by force , irredentism , racism and the threat or actual use of force , which had been considered relics of the past , manifest themselves along with rampant terrorism and other new forms of violence , deportations , ethnic cleansing , genocide and massive violations of human rights .  
Despite its own economic difficulties in the wake of the financial crisis in Asia , the Government had maintained its commitment to official development assistance ( ODA ) , which included cooperative programmes emphasizing local ownership and promoting human resources development in partnership with least developed countries . 
The Third Assessment Report ( published in 2001 ) , has projected that carbon dioxide concentrations and surface temperatures will increase globally , and asserted that the earths climate system had changed , globally and regionally , with most of the warming observed over the last 50 years attributable to human activities .  
The revised concept of operation of UNAMSIL is based on the forward deployment , in successive phases and in an integrated fashion , of the Missions military force of 17,500 personnel as well as United Nations civil affairs , civilian police and human rights personnel , representatives of humanitarian agencies and government personnel and assets to establish and consolidate State authority and basic services in areas controlled by RUF , including diamond producing regions , and in some border areas .  
In addition , pursuant to Security Council resolution 1308 ( 2000 ) of 17 July 2000 , and in the light of the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection among the population of Sierra Leone as well as among the Missions military and civilian personnel , it is proposed that a post for an HIV / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) policy officer be established at the P-4 level .  
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
At the same time , many delegates stressed that democracy was inconceivable without human rights and , in particular , the rights of women , children and minorities , and that it requires the gradual expansion of political space in order to guarantee the full exercise of the political , economic , social and cultural rights of all .  
In my view , the benchmark for a sustainable democracy is the extent to which a State acts in accordance with universal and indivisible human rights : the civil and political rights , as well as the economic , social and cultural rights defined in international human rights law .  
In addition to the loss of life and physical damage , international terrorism led to political instability , which was inimical to harmonious development of States , and made it necessary to devote huge human and financial resources to combating that scourge and eliminating its consequences .  
In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .  
Human rights must be respected and an adequate legal framework developed ; there was a need to apply sound macroeconomic policies , combat corruption and strengthen human and institutional capacities , both nationally and on the basis of international cooperation .  
Equally aware of the fact that older women , in all regions of the world , represent an important human resource , and that their contribution to society and development in the economic , cultural , political and social fields often remains unseen or unrecognized ,  
It was further observed that the fight against terrorism required a global effort based on international cooperation and international law , with due regard for human rights , and that it must go hand in hand with the search for lasting solutions to the human tragedies and political problems contributing to the instability which nurtured terrorist groups .  
Therefore , the delegations of Ecuador , Brazil , Chile , Canada and Guatemala reaffirm the importance for the strengthening and advancement of human rights and the combat of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , of developing , implementing and improving specific policies and programmes to address effectively a serious form of multiple discrimination , which occurs when racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance intersect with discrimination based on sexual orientation .  
They are pleased that they have the possibility to be treated as human beings and not mere changeable and disposable ciphers in a gigantic ideological game played by those who exercise power so that they can hold on to power and maintain a particular balance of power .  
I take heart from the new alliances I saw taking shape in Durban : the role that parliamentarians can play was highlighted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union ; the national human rights commissions sent us a powerful expression of their determination to play their part ; the treaty bodies and the special mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights played an active part ; the vital role of the media and the private sector in combating racism was emphasized .  
Energy is central to achieving the interrelated economic , social and environmental aims of sustainable human development , and energy services play a crucial role in providing efficient access to energy in support of development .  
Affirm that effective and meaningful public participation of civil society , including international and national non-governmental organizations and the private sector , is an essential component of successful and sustainable social and economic development and an important element for the promotion of human rights ;  
Calls upon all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral institutions to consider increasing allocations of human , technical and financial resources for South-South cooperation and , in this context , welcomes decision 2001 / 2 , of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Population Fund , in which the Board requested the Administrator to consider reviewing , in the context of the successor programming arrangements , the allocation of additional resources for activities involving technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Recognizing that the right of human beings to live free from fear and poverty can not be realized unless , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other international human rights instruments , conditions are created enabling all human beings to enjoy to the full their economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , the international community commits itself to treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds .  
Considering that there is a close relationship between the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and the realization of civil and political rights , since the various categories of rights constitute an indissoluble whole based on recognition of the dignity of the human person and therefore require permanent protection and promotion with a view to ensuring their full realization , so that there can never be any justification for violating one category of rights in order to realize others ,  
Considering that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent , and interrelated , and that the promotion and observance of economic , social and cultural rights are consubstantial with integrated development , equitable economic growth and the consolidation of democracy in the States of the region ,  
Reaffirming that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are mutually supportive concepts : democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural regime and their full participation in all aspects of life . 
The States of the region are asked to undertake to develop and implement national plans of action for human rights covering the entire range of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights , through a participatory process which includes civil society ;  
It is recommended that States give broad dissemination , especially among the members of the judiciary , to the international obligations that exist in the area of economic , social and cultural rights , and ensure that the necessary professional groups are trained , including those concerned with law enforcement and with human rights education at all levels of instruction ;  
International and regional organizations and the principal international and regional financial and development institutions are asked to evaluate the impact of their policies and programmes on the enjoyment of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights ;  
In January 2000 , the Security Council had recognized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic to which women and girls were especially vulnerable was a major threat to development and security , while the Commission on the Status of Women had emphasized that the full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights was of crucial importance in preventing the further spread of the disease .  
The Secretary-General , in his report prepared in June 2000 ( A / 54 / 918-S / 2000 / 581 ) , had noted that 20 years after the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and after billions of dollars had been expended to feed successive war efforts , Afghanistan remained in a state of acute crisis , with its resources depleted , its intelligentsia in exile , its people disenfranchised , its traditional political structures shattered and its human development indices among the lowest in the world .  
It is imperative that the Afghan people be central to the political plan , and that their human rights , long denied to them , and their legitimate expectation to live in freedom and with dignity in a society where peace is restored and the rule of law protects their lives and their livelihoods against violence and the depredations of powerful warlords , be realized .  
The utilization of the human resources services applications by the users during the reported period was comparable to the previous year ; the average number of personnel actions processed monthly at Headquarters was approximately 3,600 , compared with 3,500 reported in the twelfth progress report . 
In carrying out his mandate , the independent expert must respect a set of basic principles to be embodied in the resolution requesting his appointment , including international cooperation based on Article 2 of the United Nations Charter , the condemnation of unilateral actions , respect for the key role of States in action to combat impunity and the obligation to determine the responsibility of the perpetrators of human rights violations as an essential component of effective compensation and international cooperation through universally applicable mechanisms . 
The Government also reported that a supreme decree of June 2001 established the Truth Commission , whose mandate is to help shed light on the crimes and human rights violations committed by terrorist organizations and State agents , to prepare proposals on moral and material reparations for victims and their families and to recommend legal and institutional reforms as preventive guarantees .  
Welcomes the convening by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of an expert meeting to discuss traditional and new forms of mercenary activities as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination , and takes note of its report , [ 5 ] as a valuable contribution to the process of elaborating a clearer legal definition of mercenaries that would make more efficient the prevention and punishment of mercenary activities ;  
The unanimous anger aroused by the human and psychological damage done to the American people by the unexpected and shocking deaths of thousands of innocent people , whose images have shaken the world , is understandable .  
After the so-called end of the cold war , those who continued a military build-up and the development of the most sophisticated means of killing and exterminating human beings were aware that their huge military investments would give them the privilege of imposing their absolute and complete dominance over the other peoples of the world .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Among the recommendations of the Secretary-General was the strengthening of the mandate of BONUCA in order to enhance its effectiveness and the visibility of its activities by increasing its resource capabilities , strengthening its administrative capacities and making available to the Office a level of resources commensurate with its revised mandate , namely , bringing about political dialogue and national reconciliation , monitoring the security situation , ensuring respect for and the promotion of human rights ; and providing political support for the mobilization of resources with a view to the economic reconstruction of the country .  
They have shown that proper prenatal and obstetric care , safe and reliable contraception , human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) prevention and care , and other aspects of health for women are inseparable from such basic amenities as reliable transportation , hygienic conditions and clean water .  
The principle of voluntary and informed choice in respect of the provision of sexual and reproductive health services should be recognized as a basic human right .

More generally , science and technology are equally fundamental to pursuing solutions to human health and social issues , ranging from key human health questions such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) to sustainable transportation .  
Recalling further its resolutions 52 / 220 of 22 December 1997 , 53 / 242 of 28 July 1999 and 55 / 195 of 20 December 2000 in which it requested the Secretary-General to consider further strengthening the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) through the provision of the requisite support and stable , adequate and predictable financial resources , including additional regular budget and human resources ,

To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
The fact that the human person is the central subject and primary beneficiary of human rights distinguishes human rights , including the right of authors to the moral and material interests in their works , from legal rights recognized in intellectual property systems .  
Whereas human rights are dedicated to assuring satisfactory standards of human welfare and well-being , intellectual property regimes , although they traditionally provide protection to individual authors and creators , are increasingly focused on protecting business and corporate interests and investments .  
Fourth , because the Commission can not possibly , for political and / or practical reasons , shed light on all countries in which there are severe and consistent patterns of human rights abuse , the Sub-Commission has used country-specific resolutions and statements by the Chairperson to help identify and put pressure on those countries which may not have received adequate attention in other human rights bodies .  
The Sub-Commission has particularly strengthened its expertise in the area of economic , social and cultural rights , and that expertise is manifesting itself in the development of the Social Forum and a number of thoughtful and timely studies and resolutions , including those on globalization , international trade and human rights , the effect of intellectual property on human rights , and the relationship between businesses and human rights .  
Thus , while providing information on the status of the UNCCD process , the reports should also contribute to the strengthening of the institutional and human capacities of national focal points and national coordinating bodies , thereby improving their ability to coordinate the work and to stimulate the further steps required for effective implementation of the UNCCD as an integral part of national efforts to promote sustainable development and global environmental protection .  
The review shall be open and transparent , inclusive , flexible and facilitative , as well as effective in terms of the use of financial , technological and human resources .

In contrast , the visible light from obtrusive advertising , defined as advertising in outer space that is capable of being recognised by a human being on the surface of the Earth without the aid of a telescope or other technological device , [ 2 ] is inescapable .  
This growth in international information-sharing is linked to a large extent to increasing global awareness of the need for continuous monitoring of the environment , natural resources and changes stemming from human activity , as well as emergency management , together with the free use of previously restricted technologies .  
On the contrary , international cooperation must be strengthened through increased development of institutional and human capacity , a more dynamic transfer of technology and know-how and adequate financing .  
The World Bank hoped that that report would contribute to the global debate at a time when it was imperative for individuals and communities to better manage their human , social , physical and natural resources in the long term and to rethink their basic assumptions about how to use the planets riches and plan economic development .  
Tunisia also attached great importance to the transparency of the Rio + 10 process , which , after assessing progress over the past 10 years , should develop specific action for the future and establish a detailed schedule for implementation of the Rio commitments , particularly those involving human and institutional capacity-building , the transfer of ecologically rational technologies and the provision of financial resources . 
While that great collective task which mobilized the entire international community would , of course , require human and material resources , it would also require strengthened international assistance for the implementation of environmental protection conventions and promotion of a new global partnership and a new social ethic that must be the goal and the aspiration of the Johannesburg Summit .

The High Commissioner , with regard to the accountability within the Indonesian judicial system for human rights offences perpetrated in East Timor , is of the view that the revised Decree 96 confers impunity for international crimes by limiting the temporal and geographical jurisdiction of the ad hoc court and that , accordingly , the United Nations , as a matter of principle , can not associate itself with proceedings thereunder .

There was a need to give legal meaning and support to economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development at the domestic level ; concrete steps should be taken to entrench those rights in constitutions and ensure their justiciability as human rights and not mere aspirations ; judges and lawyers had an important role and responsibility in that regard ; their independence must be safeguarded by Governments ;

Chinese scientists ' research on human genome has been fully supported by the State 's Program 869 and Program 973 , Natural Science Foundation and others .  On April 21 , the relevant person in charge at the State Natural Science Foundation said in an interview that opening the human gene database to the public free of charge can allow ordinary people access to the cutting-edge science .  The person in charge said the more the public get to know about the innovative science , the more motivated scientists will feel for research .  
Li Jing said that wetlands in the northwest not only account for a large proportion of China 's wetlands but were mainly located in sensitive areas like headwater areas , oases , riversides and inland lakes .  Under natural and human influences , they are not easily recoverable once damaged .  
Now the western region should firmly seize the good opportunity for massive development , formulate a preferential policy , improve working conditions , and step up its efforts to bring in and use qualified personnel ; not only should it fully develop and utilize its own human resources but it should be able to retain qualified personnel and use them creatively ; moreover , it should make positive efforts to attract a large number of qualified personnel from developed areas and even from abroad to work for the massive development of the western region .  
Seizing the opportunity for common development with the western region , the eastern region should formulate concrete measures to actively train and provide qualified personnel for the western region ; it should encourage local outstanding personnel to seek new development in the western region and practically assist the latter in solving problems of want of human resources , instability of the cadre ranks , and an irrational cadre structure and distribution so as to promote the economic and social development of the western region together .  
According to its own special features , Tunisia has selected development ways which are suitable to its national situation and has made noticeable achievements in safeguarding social stability , promoting the development of the economy , and improving the living conditions of the people ; thus Tunisia has done its best to safeguard human rights .  
Because of their narrow education values , lopsided views on quality , and outmoded notions on talent , the education department and parents tend to one-sidedly pursue enrollment quotas and overlook students ' psychological quality and moral character and their disciplinary and legal education , thus placing the value of course grades above human values and replacing the objective of education with the goal of human and social development .  
We urge the United States to observe the basic principles governing international relations , correct its erroneous doings , and stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries by using the so-called human rights issue .  
The two countries ' foreign ministers called for the unconditional respect for the right of the people of all countries to choose social systems , value concepts , and ways of development in line with their countries ' conditions .  They considered the interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries on humanitarian grounds and in the name of protecting human rights constitute acts that violate the purpose and principle of the United Nations Charter .  
As technological innovation is an important guarantee for enhancing competitiveness and achieving internationalization , Chinese household electrical appliance enterprises have not relaxed in technological innovation even for a moment after making it into the international market , investing massive human , material , and financial resources in technological innovation as well as marketizing , internationalizing , and commercializing it .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
The main reason why the United States produces an annual country report on human rights practices , heedless of the strong opposition of other countries , assumes the air of a " judge of human rights , " and insists on interfering in affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries is mainly to use this as a pretext for putting political pressure on other countries , especially developing and socialist countries , in a bid to change their political and social systems .  
Hegemonism is also manifest in the fact that the US annual Country Report on Human Rights Practices ignores the objective fact that human rights in China are improving all the time , and shows serious political bias in yet again attacking China at great length .  
The United States , mouthing human rights , in the end utilized concentrated bombing and depleted uranium bombs - - weapons prohibited by international law , and bombed residential sites , schools , hospital , and other civilian targets , even flagrantly bombing chemical installations , causing the spread of chemicals and reagents , seemingly carrying out chemical warfare .  
These countries stressed that the United States does not have the authority to criticize the human rights situation of other countries , and this kind of application of the domestic law of one nation to the legal system of other nations is not only no in accordance with international law , but is not helpful to realizing mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among nations .  
In other words , they attempt to bring developing countries to their strategic track and force developing countries to facilitate their hegemonist goal and to be their dependencies .  However , most developing countries have the bitter experience of being bullied and humiliated by Western big powers , thus they extremely treasure their national sovereignty and dignity and , of course , resolutely oppose and struggle against the so-called " human rights standard " and the " values " foisted on them by the current hegemonist powers .  
For example also , the overwhelming majority of China 's analysts held that the so-called " human rights being higher than sovereignty " is only a used by a hegemonist country to promote power politics .  The vast numbers of developing nations will not be able to achieve independent political and economic development and human rights in the modern sense if they depart from the framework of sovereignty and the protection of international law .  
Teachers are engineers of human souls ; improving teachers ' ideological and political qualities and ethics cultivation will be of decisive significance to the comprehensive ethical , intellectual , physical , and aesthetic development of children and youths and to training qualified personnel for modernization construction .  
Accession to the WTO will be a major step in our country 's economic development strategy in the 21st century .  With the inevitable enhancement of foreign exchanges , there will be more intensive exchanges and movements of human , material , information , and financial resources .  
Although Uganda , in the highlands of East Africa , is separated from China by thousands of miles , there are striking similarities between the activities of the " Movement for the Restoration of the 10 Commandments of God " and the " Falungong " cult that had caused mass unrest in China : They both made up stories , engaged in deification , spread heresy , hoodwinked the people , formed secret societies , swindled money and accumulated wealth by unfair means , persecuted good and innocent people , showed contempt for human rights . . .  
He noted that for decades , this movement has adhered to the aims and principles of independence , autonomy , non-alignment , and non-grouping , always devoting its efforts to defending the interests of the many developing countries , and actively promoting the establishment of a new just and rational international political and economic order , in an outstanding effort to promote peace and development for the human race .  
All countries should have the right to act in line with their native national conditions to choose their respective political systems and development models .  No nation or group of states has the right to force its values and social system onto others , even less so to exploit the human rights matter or a so-called " humanitarian crisis " as an excuse to deliberately interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country .  
makes information distorted and policy decisions wrong ; causes the waste of many human , material , and financial resources and precious time ; and enables the people to lose many rare chances for development .

It is a yearbook that gives a comprehensive look into the development of human rights in new China .  
The publication of this yearbook filled a major void in China 's human rights theoretical building , provided authoritative materials for the international community to understand China 's views on human rights and China 's human rights reality , and provided effective objective facts and theories to refute international hostile forces ' distortion of and attack against China 's human rights conditions .  
At the same time , while protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups , the governments must respect the universal principle concerning human rights acknowledged by the international community and also have the right to adopt measures that commensurate with their own national conditions in the light of their own realities because historical background , cultural tradition , development level , and nationality composition vary from country to country .  
Cult leaders accumulated wealth unlawfully and in a big way , and organised their followers to besiege media units , schools , scientific research institutes critical of the sect , seriously disturbing the public order , infringing upon human rights , and endangering other people 's personal safety .  
The barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia by the US-led NATO forces over 78 days from March to June 1999 pushed hegemonism to a new level that is even more dangerous , threatening , and hypocritical .  That is , a new stage in which , in the name of preventing a humanitarian disaster , they have tied human rights diplomacy and military aggression even more tightly together , and a new stage in which hypocrisy and brutality are combined even more shamelessly .  
This kind of " international interference " can only be applicable within the commonwealth of sovereign states basically sharing similar political systems , legal standards , and value concepts and reaching a common view on human rights .  
During reform and opening up as well as during its modernization drives , China has attached importance to and advocated the all-round development of people .  It not only emphasizes the social and economic rights of the people but also vigorously develops and safeguards the political rights of citizens , strives for realizing the " all-round human rights , " which include political rights , economic rights , social rights , and cultural rights as well collective rights and individual rights .  
Liu Jing said : In the process of implementing the " declaration on the rights and obligations of individuals , groups , and social organizations in enhancing and protecting generally-acknowledged human rights and basic freedom , " which was passed in 1998 , it is natural to encounter various questions .  This is an inevitable fact .  The concern of the international community in this respect is understandable .  
The outgoing IMF managing director , Michel Camdessus , said : We have the opportunity to avoid financial crisis and narrow the wide gap between the rich and the poor that " may possibly cause an explosion " so that economic globalization will have human nature in a greater sense .  However , the premise for so doing is that the international economic structure must be commensurate with economic globalization and economic reform plans are widely supported by the populace .  
However , the United States ignored facts and again put forward an anti-China motion at the meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights to meet the needs of its domestic political and party struggle , in a vain attempt to make use of the so-called human rights issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs and vilify China 's international image .  
Such practice of using the human rights issue as a political tool to create ideological confrontation and promote hegemonism epitomizes politicization of the human rights issue , utterly violates the purpose and principles of the UN Charter and runs counter to the trend of the times , in which the international community calls for dialogue and cooperation .  It is only natural that the resolution was rejected by a majority of the members of the UN Human Rights Commission , and opposed by the just world opinion .  
and the United States is constantly mired in scandals of infringing upon human rights in other countries , and marked by numerous notorious records of its engagement in unjust military aggressions everywhere and disregarding the established principles of international law .  
If the US Government could be introspective regarding their failure , it would not be difficult to discover that the politicizing of human rights is wishful thinking , and has already caused a lot of countries in the world , especially developing countries , to be strongly disapproving .  And it is also an obstacle to all kinds of economic development by the United Nations . This affects dialogue and cooperation about human rights between all member countries .  
The overall concept and content of human rights are indivisible and unchangeable .  The firm stride of the Chinese people walking toward domestic prosperity is unstoppable .  
At the UN human rights meetings , the United States provoked confrontation and disputes on many occasions out of certain domestic political needs and also its stubborn mentality of " moral imperialism " and the so-called international strategy of national egoism .  
In the wake of the deepening of reforms and the development of socialist market economy , economic components and interests , social organizational forms and social ways of life , and jobs and employment methods are becoming more varied by the day , and this inevitably affects people 's ideological concepts and human relations in various ways , and some of these influences are negative ;  
We should apply Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory to enhance the ideological and political levels of the young cadres ; apply modern scientific knowledge and the fruits of outstanding human culture to enhance their professional standards ; apply the practice of arduous and complex environment and a variety of posts to temper and enhance their leadership ability ;  
Wei Ziqing ( researcher and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering ) : The use of satellite navigation is extremely widespread , from outer space to the land and sea , and from military and economic activities to our human and social lives , it reaches every trade and industry , e.g . , space navigation , determining satellite orbits , space surveys and mapping , weapons guidance , traffic and transportation , agriculture , forestry , and mining , geodetic surveys , and rescue and disaster relief , etc . 
We have taken the complementary paths of pre-study and modeling , import and self-development , scientific research and production , military products and civil products , and scientific and technological development and nurturing of human talent for scientific research units being brought into the marketplace in order to implement high starting points for development and a name brand strategy and advance into the " open " market seeking new points for profit increase .  
Only Marxism discovered for the first time the law of development of human society , namely existence decides consciousness , material production decides spiritual production , economic foundation decides super structure , the relations between productive force and production and the contradictions between economic foundation and superstructure push social progress .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
Fujian has promulgated and put into effect the " Fujian Management Regulations for Coastal Shipping , Border Defense , and Public Security " , setting up a " top official " leadership responsibility system for fighting illegal emigration , for a harsh crackdown by law on snake-heads and human smugglers .  And it has set up an exclusive snake-head crackdown taskforce , engaging in " online snake-head arrests " , all of which steps show Fujian 's firm stand and resolve against illegal emigration .  
The reality of changing the use of violence from unlimited to controllable realistically indicates that along with the ceaseless improvement in the civilization degree of human society , the miserable way of wars that were applied in the past has been changed .  
In future international competitions , able personnel and the quality of man will become two decisive factors , and whoever can successfully seize the commanding heights in the field of able personnel and can hold in possession rich human sources will be able to gain the upper hand in competition .  
among the objective environment and major theories and problems of implementation which affect people 's ideological activities , one is the actual situation where the lightning increase in the total quantity of human knowledge and the rapid breakthroughs in modern technology of the " knowledge economy " which has the entire world as its scope have already shown themselves .  
This regiment was equipped with certain advanced anti-tank self-propelled guns and anti-tank missiles , but some battalions and companies failed to concentrate their main energies on the development and application of the property of the new equipment and the mastery of weapons in hand .  Instead , they put a lot of financial , material and human resources into learning English and microcomputer technology , and making multi-media software .  All battalions and companies of this regiment reported more than 30 science-technology military training achievements to the regiment in a year .  
" It is difficult to draw a human being but it is easy to draw a ghost " .  This is how the Chinese describe tricks aimed at deceiving people with fabricated stories , meaning that it is difficult to deceive people with what is real or can be seen but easy to lead people astray with what is absurd or preposterous .  
For the various policies that the United States has adopted for the implementation of its national strategy , one distinct feature is that differences in ideologies and values are being used to serve specific strategic purposes ; and as it has turned out , the United States is practicing a double standard when evaluating human rights and social values .  
The US strategy of human rights and values that we are talking about here is not simply a " soft " power , because it actually interacts with the strong superiority of the United States in the scientific and technological as well as economic fields , and also interacts with the active military presence of the United States in regions concerned .  
We must clearly perceive the political conspiracy and sinister ambition of western hostile forces on the human rights issue , always remain politically sober and staunch , and shoulder our mission of protecting the nation 's security and unity .  
Internationally speaking , the trend of multi-polarization keeps developing , and the world situation generally tends to relax .  However , the world is not peaceful , as the superpower is still pursuing hegemonism , propagating such absurd views as " human rights overriding sovereignty " and " legitimate humanitarian intervention " , or even resorting to armed aggression and expansion .  
Human society 's change from the pastoral civilization to agricultural civilization and from agricultural civilization to industrial civilization was the qualitative leap of the human social and economic development after the structural adjustments were repeatedly accumulated to a certain stage .  
In addition to continuously taking readers ' requirements into first consideration and regarding scientific ways of health preservation and health care as main contents , this section will add some relevant new columns , such as self-treatment of diseases , miraculous ways for long life , origins of human relations , Doctor Feng 's mailbox , weekly medicated food , the quickest way for improving one 's looks , psychology hotlines , and new medical findings .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
The 20th century saw a series of major events that affected the course of the world history , but what had the greatest impact on the changes in human society and induced the most profound speculations is the transformation of the socialist ideal into practice , from practice into system , from the practice of a single country into the practice of numerous countries , and again from a triumphant march into a tortuous journey .  
With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
Socialism has opened up the way to the solution of the contradiction between the productive forces and relations of production inherent in capitalism , and , while liberating the productive forces of socialist countries to the utmost extent , at the same time objectively promoted the improvement of capitalist system .  Capitalism 's internal contradictions got somewhat smoothed out , and capitalism was given a new opportunity for development ; this , in its turn advanced socialist production and the development and progress of human civilization as a whole .  
As everyone knows , the Kosovo war was a war of aggression in which the United States mustered the NATO states to intervene in barbaric fashion in the internal affairs of a small and weak country while waving the banner of " human rights transcend sovereignty , " heedless of the UN charter and the accepted norms of international relations , and without UN authorization .  
Pilotless combat planes can complete various missions without the limitations set by the human body , such as approaching close to forward positions , carrying ground tracking sensors , synthetic aperture radar sensors , moving target indicators , and so on , or else doing on-the-spot monitoring of chemical and biological substances .  
One of the important issues in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to correctly deal with the influence of the international environment and the international political struggle on people 's thoughts in the course of persistently carrying out reforms , opening up , and increasing economic and cultural exchanges with the outside world , while actively absorbing and learning from all the good results achieved by human society as a whole in civilization development , and effectively resist the corrosive influence of the decadent ideologies and cultures from the West .  
This tragic incident has further exposed the antihuman , antisocial , and antiscientific essence of the " Falungong " cult and pierced through the sham features of Li Hongzhi and western anti-China forces in preaching that permitting the practice of " Falungong " means " upholding human rights " .  
Their twisted and fallacious theories create great psychological pressure on many people , not only driving their followers to the path of death , making their wives and children walk out on them , breaking up the families , and ruining lives , but also seriously undermining public order , violating the law and normal moral standards , infringing on basic human rights and freedom , and lead to anti-humanity , anti-social , and anti-science crimes .  
Western countries headed by the United States always draw an ideological line by only recognizing western value standards and human rights concepts , and they want every country to completely copy their ways , irrespective of their historical traditions and level of social and economic development .  This has already caused social turmoil and even war in certain African countries .  
In order to deceive people , he disguised himself as a religious leader who had suffered persecution , and accused the Chinese Government of violating human rights .  He took credit and sought rewards from his master in the West by acting against the Chinese Government . He openly served as a shameful tool and a pawn of anti-China forces in the West in an attempt to play a role in helping anti-China forces in the West promote " Westernization " in China and " split " China .  
They practiced a double standard on the issue of handling heretical cults .  In its own country , the US has adopted resolute measures to deal with heretic cult organizations such as the " Planet " and " Branch Davidians " heretic cults .  However , in the name of " safeguarding human rights , " it has made a fuss about China 's legal activities to outlaw the heretic cult of " Falungong , " and this will gradually become an integral part of its China strategy .  
The successful development of 6,000-meter underwater robots has helped surmounted the barriers the ocean has set for human beings .  As a result , China has mastered the important weaponry to advance toward the deep sea , and become one of the few countries equipped with this technique .  
The ratification of the " convention " has been declared publicly to the international community that China is exerting efforts to develop human rights undertakings in accordance with national conditions , and is resolute and confident in guaranteeing that all citizens can enjoy all kinds of human rights and basic freedom .  This act will further enhance China 's prestige in the international arena and better foster China 's good image of democracy , civilization , and respecting human rights in the international arena .  
Since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have attached prime importance to people 's right of existence in accordance with China 's national conditions , succeeded in realizing two historical leaps - - moving from poverty to having enough food and clothing and then to leading a comparatively comfortable life , and achieved comprehensive economic and social development .  World-shaking changes have taken place in China 's human rights situation , and China has been generally praised by the international community for these changes .  
The obsessive " Falungong " followers who set themselves ablaze at Tiananmen Square on Chinese New Year 's eve perpetrated a self-immolation incident that shook the whole world because they had long been poisoned by the evil fallacies of Li Hongzhi . They had lost their sense of reasoning as normal human beings when they turned their backs on their loved ones , their family , their school and the normal society .  
The " Covenant " actually confirms such basic human rights as the right of survival and the right of development .  It points out : Only after the creation of the economic , social , and cultural rights that can be enjoyed by all people , as the creation of the same conditions for civil and political rights available to all people , will the ideal freedom which frees mankind from terror and shortage be realized .  
These Interim Procedures have replaced the non-selection resettlement model based on assignment with a model that combines assignment with self-assignment .  This model will help make full use of the expertise of retired cadres and help these cadres obtain their desired goal .  This model also provides a legal guarantee the reasonable distribution of high-quality professional human resources .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
As a rule , such U.S . official " human rights reports " flagrantly criticize the human rights situations in other countries .  They cite hearsay of one kind or another , but can not present any valid evidence .  Because of this , the reports have been regarded by international public opinion as a combination of " misinformation , exaggerations , groundless accusations , and lopsided and arbitrary conclusions " .  
In recent years , as China has developed into a stronger China with continually enhanced international status , which the United States does not like to see , while strategically maintaining ties and economically occupying the China market , the United States has stubbornly played the human rights card , sowed discord between the masses and the government , and frequently caused trouble , interfering in , blocking , and sabotaging the cause of the Chinese people in following the road they have chosen and continually developing and growing stronger .  
Sixth , vigorously implement the strategy of invigorating Tibet through science and education , give priority to the development of education , exploit and make good use of human and S &amp; T resources within and without Tibet and shift economic and social development to the track of reliance on scientific and technological advances and improved quality of laborers .  
To always represent the way forward for advanced culture is to persist in developing what is useful and discarding what is not , correctly handle the relationship between inheriting the national traditional culture and blazing new trails , and strengthen cultural exchanges between fraternal nationalities so as to absorb all fruits of civilization of the human society .  
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
This is so because , first , radical and emotional nationalism directly appeals to " first principles of survival " and attacks all dissenting voices as threats to national survival ; in this way , it attempts to exclusively occupy intellectual and public opinion commanding heights , so as to become the dominant speech prevailing over all other human values and the virtual " supreme command . "  
President Jiang Zemin pointed out not long ago : After China participates in the " International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , " China will subject itself to the United Nations ' supervision , will conscientiously fulfill the state obligations specified by the " Covenant , " will effectively promote the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights for the Chinese citizens by legislative , administrative , and other means , and will thus make contributions to the human rights cause in the world .  
The delegation also held special report sessions on " opposing evil cult , guaranteeing human rights " for Chinese students studying in France and for overseas Chinese living and working in France . During its visit , the delegation also met with leaders of the French official and non-governmental anti-cult organizations and leaders of the French religious circles .  Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
At the current human rights meeting , the United States once again groundlessly attacked China , set forth an anti-China motion , and provoked confrontation .  To retort , Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai pointed out in all seriousness that the United States was keen to dish out human rights motions against other countries , wantonly attacked other countries ' political systems by flaunting the banner of " safeguarding human rights , " tried hard to turn human rights issues into political issues for achieving its political purpose of exerting pressure onto other countries .  
" Falungong " stirred up an immolation incident , and has harmed human lives , impaired " Falungong " practitioners ' physical and mental health , assembled people to make troubles , disrupted social order , and undermined national security - - all these are characteristics common to sects .  
Professor Yu frankly admitted that as a developing country with a population of 1.2-billion , China 's per capita natural resources are comparatively scant , its current economic and cultural development is imbalanced , its legal system is not complete , and , in the process of law enforcement , some laws are not strictly abided by and some laws are not strictly enforced - - all these contribute to the non-perfect human rights situation in China .  
Zhang Xiaoling , a professor at the Central Party School who has been devoted to the specialized study of " women and human rights , " further expounded that according to the International Human Rights Charter , human rights can be classified into two categories - - civil and political rights and economic , social , and cultural rights .  
Take its handling of the Tibet question for example , after taking office in 1993 , former US President Bill Clinton again highlighted the values of human rights by following in Jimmy Carter 's footsteps .  Clinton declared : If China refuses to make improvement on human rights , the United States will not grant MFN status to China . Clinton also listed protecting Tibet 's unique religious or cultural heritage in his wish list on human rights and even arranged an unscheduled meeting between himself and Dalai in the White House .  
Though quite a few US congressmen , including both senators and representatives , had expressed strong opposition to delinking the Chinese communists ' improvement on human rights with the MFN status , the US Congress eventually gave in to its self-advertised psychological tactic of economic liberalization and decided to normalize trade relations with China , and this deprived the United States of a strong bargaining counter with regard to sanctions against China over the issue of human rights .  
On the one hand , we make constant efforts to perfect human rights in China , and on the other hand , we continue to engage in dialogue with foreign friends .  Only when dialogue proceeds from a level playing field , can we advance mutual understanding and promote mutual exchange and cooperation .  
Cai added : Over the past few years , neo-interventionism centered on such theories as " human rights overriding sovereignty , " " sovereignty being limited , " and others have caused a great clamor , and certain countries have adopted a double standard on the issue of human rights and have interfered in other countries ' internal affairs on the pretext of humanitarianism , and this has posed a new threat to the world peace and security .  
The editorial says : The current incident of bumping aircraft was caused by the US side single-handedly based on human testimony and material evidence .  However , the US side made unfounded countercharges after the incident , unreasonably criticized the Chinese side , and even used international law to evade its responsibility .  
The editorial says : The United States claims to be a country being most respectful to democracy and legal system in the world and always talks about human rights and law .  However , its military plane wantonly violated international law and paid no attention to the territories and sovereignty of another country .  
In 2000 , the Ninth Five-Year for National Economic and Social Development was successfully completed , the development of the western region got off to a good start , and the economy developed in a healthy way .  During that year , China 's democratic and legal systems were continuously strengthened , and its human rights situation maintained a good momentum of development .  
In light of China 's national conditions and according to the people 's wishes , the Chinese government aims to build a democratic and modernized country with a high level of civilization under the rule of law , and actively learn from the beneficial experiences and cultural achievements of other countries .  While maintaining social stability , it also aims to expedite development , strengthen the democratic legal system , promote spiritual civilization , and continuously push forward the development of the human rights cause .  
All these activities provide rich basic materials for the research of human rights theories , expand the scope of human right theoretical research in China , and have filled up some gaps in the research of human rights in China , enhanced the level of human rights theoretical research , and also provided a benign social environment for the development of human rights theoretical research in China .  
Wang Faqiang , vice president of the Armed Police General Hospital , who has personally saved the lives of over 1,300 patients in all kinds of critical conditions , said that as medical workers , duty-bound to heal the wounded and rescue the dying , I and my colleagues are deeply aware that human beings are the most precious .  
She pointed out that the achievements gained in the customs ' scientific and technological work are the results of the exploration and innovation made by the vast number of customs ' scientific and technological personnel as well as their selfless dedication .  The advanced customs scientific and technological collectives and individuals who were commended today are the outstanding representatives of the contingent of scientists and technicians .  They are the invaluable human resources of the customs sector and deserve the commendation and handsome rewards .  
China has cracked down on " Falungong " according to the law , exposed Li Hongzhi 's deception , cut off the murdering paws of the cults , made most " Falungong " practitioners see through the true nature of the cult and enabled them to return to normal life , rescued those fanatic practitioners who fell into the trap set up by the cult , and helped avoid the occurrence of human tragedy .  
Today , at a special meeting on training and promoting female cadres and recruiting female party members held by the CPC Central Organization Department , Zeng Qinghong , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee , member of the CPC Central Secretariat , and director of the CPC Central Organization Department , stressed that women are " half the sky " in human society and Chinese women form an important force in our country 's socialist modernization drive .  
Once people practice Falungong , they would place themselves under the control of the cult 's tightly knitted organization and its cruel spiritual shackles .  Gradually the practitioners would become depressed and apathetic , with no sense of responsibility toward society and family .  After losing their basic human nature , obsessed Falungong practitioners could become extraordinarily cruel and violent and could do incredible things .  
The citizens of Cincinnati were extremely angry after this incident of acting with total disregard for human life occurred , and protest demonstrations developed into violent citywide racial clashes .  
Zhu Feng : The Chinese government has all along assigned importance to and treasured the stability and constructive development of Sino-US relations .  Sustained intervention by the United States on China 's human rights condition in this process has hurt the friendly feelings of the Chinese people .  It has also widened the scope of disputes between the two countries and artificially complicated and sharpened bilateral relations .  
Touching on the prospects for the development of bilateral relations , Hu Jintao said that friendly relations between China and Vietnam constitute a valuable asset of the two parties and two peoples .  Strengthened cooperation between the two parties and two nations is not only beneficial to the building of socialism in Vietnam and China and to economic prosperity and social progress in the two countries but also conducive to promoting peace and human progress in Asia and the world .  
Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .  
He pointed out : Every time the anti-China motion is raised , the United States makes the same argument that the human rights situation in China has been deteriorating , and such an argument is in total disregard of China 's great achievements in developing its economy and promoting social progress and the fact that the Chinese people are enjoying civil and political rights to an unprecedented degree in terms of both scope and depth in these years .  
The Pakistani people are so full of wisdom .  His humorous words laid bare the fact that the United States keeps using its " 301 Article " against developing countries and tries to link the human rights issue to China 's permanent normal trade position .  Even the US representative could not help but force a wry and embarrassed smile .  
Since these training exercises , be they staged on a map , on a computer in a simulated manner , or with real arms and real men , often involve a large amount of financial and human resources and organizational efforts , we should study ways of fully developing their exemplary or guiding roles for our teaching and training work ;  
Wu Yi pointed out : Cities are situated in a central position in economic and social development , and play a strong influential and leading role in their peripheral areas .  It is necessary to do creative work in accordance with the actual conditions , give full play to their advantages in science , technology , education , and human resources , and more quickly advance the implementation of the strategy of promoting trade with science and technology .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that China and Syria are both developing countries ; the Chinese Government values its traditional friendship with Syria and appreciates and thanks the Syrian Government for its enduring valuable support for China on the Taiwan and human rights issues ; it is ready to continue to maintain and strengthen coordination and cooperation with Syria in all fields in the new century , and raise to a new level the enduringly stable bilateral relationship of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation .  
In conducting education and training of middle-aged and young cadres , we must pay close attention mainly to two things : One is that we must help them master the basic tenets of Marxism , get a clear understanding of the objective laws governing the development of human society , and buttress confidence in taking the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics , and guide them to emancipate the mind , use their brains , conduct new explorations in the light of new realities , and promote innovations and development in Marxist theory .  
Wang Zhongyu said : In the work of training and attracting talented , skilled , and qualified people , efforts should be focused on meeting the urgent human resources needs at the higher levels , thus enhancing the overall level of human resources in our country , enhancing our international competition power , and providing human resources guarantee for developing science , technology , and productivity by leaps and bounds .  
The attempted bloody self-immolation incident plotted by the Dalai clique once again let people clearly see , hidden under the hypocritical face of " guardian of human rights " of the 14th Dalai Lama , its bloody nature of harming human lives , harming society , trampling on human rights , and splitting the motherland .  
Over the last 50 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet , epoch-making and deep-going changes have taken place in Tibet . It has completed democratic reform , abolished the feudal serf system , and realized the regional autonomy of minority nationalities .  Millions of serfs who did not even have basic human rights in the past have truly become masters of society and the country .  
Asia and Europe are also known for superior economic , scientific , and technological strength , rich human resources , and vast markets which can not be found elsewhere , and this has provided a sound basis for the two sides to strengthen bilateral cooperation .  
Lenin said : " Only by being armed with all human knowledge can one become a communist . "  Only the new type of military personnel armed with all human knowledge , especially modern high-science and - technology knowledge , can accomplish our military 's historical mission of prevailing on the battlefield and remaining unchanged in nature .  
They have taken advantage of the channels of international economic and cultural exchanges and dissemination to energetically advertise the political concepts of bourgeois democracy , freedom , and human rights , pursue egoistic values , advocate the reactionary views of divesting armed forces of party leadership and depoliticizing them , vilify CPC leadership , and wage an all-out attack against China 's socialist system with the aim of bringing about a credibility crisis or confidence crisis among the people , who will eventually abandon party leadership and the socialist system .  
In recent years , in particular , the Western hostile forces have made use of the theories of human rights , globalization , and environmental protection , which are of common concern to the people , to pursue their strategy of westernization and disintegration behind a fashionable facade and under the pretence of the scientific nature of academic research , the objective nature of news reports , and the recreational nature of literary and art works and , for this reason , they are very confusing and deceptive .  
If this situation is not resolved , people will be unable to clearly distinguish between the problems of national position , the independence and reunification issue and values of political parties and ideology , and will be unable to understand that free and democratic human rights can not supersede the framework of national sovereignty and the integrity of territory .  The DPP government of Chen Shui-bian can not let go of their evil intentions in the form of a coalition government .  
It organically combines being rigorously scientific with being highly revolutionary , expounds profound theories with simple and easily understood language , and uses irrefutable facts and incontrovertible logic to reveal laws of development of human society , thereby pointing out the correct direction of human progress and social development and becoming an immortal monument to intellectual activity in the history of human civilization .  
It critically incorporated British and French utopian socialism 's theory on fairness and justice in human society , the rational cores of dialectics of Germany 's classical philosophy and materialism , British classical political economy 's method for dissecting the capitalist economy , and intellectual pith in the latest achievements of natural sciences .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
It embodies the outstanding intelligence , courage , and innovation of the leaders of the five countries .  It has made precious contributions to the efforts made by human society in transcending the Cold War mentality and establishing a brand-new model for international relations .  It has introduced a new security concept , which is based on mutual trust , disarmament , and cooperative security .  
The exhibition is vivid teaching material for party history .  It is of great , realistic significance for us to run the government and educate people in line with history , accurately understand and grasp the law governing the development of human society , and inherit and carry forward the party 's fine traditions and work styles under new historical conditions .  
He stressed China must sensitively keep pace with the general trend of the current scientific-technological development , fully assess the great significance of future scientific-technological development to human society , heighten their sense of urgency and , taking into consideration of the actual needs of China 's development , act immediately to catch up with the world 's advanced scientific and technological research and press forward to create a new situation for China 's thriving scientific-technological development .  
This is not only a good method of resolving the issue of a lack of funds , but will also bring in professional human resources , information , advanced technology and management expertise , and scientific marketing networks .

To improve the party 's leadership and party building , we must first proceed from these two major transformations to earnestly study theoretical and practical issues facing party building under the new historical conditions and study the laws governing the rule of the country by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and the development of human society that underlie these issues so as to better advance party building .  
In accordance with their international obligations and national laws and regulations , the two parties will take effective steps to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of legal and human entities of one party in the territory of the other party , and will provide each other with the necessary assistance in civil and criminal adjudication .  
The US ground force has deemed it imperative to build mobile command centers , ensure rapid and long-range mobilization , handle a huge amount of transmitted information , introduce highly efficient planning procedures , and re-divide work between human beings and machines , so that staff offices will mainly perform direct calculations on software while commanding officers and staff officers will mainly handle a dynamic situation a machine can not . 
On the basis of bilateral cooperation and in accordance with the respective development targets and advantages of China and ASEAN , the Chinese side proposes to identify the five areas of agriculture , human resources development , cooperative development of the Mekong River Basin , information and communications technologies and mutual investment as key areas for China-ASEAN cooperation in the first few years of the new century in order to make more effective and centralized use of the resources and strengths of both sides .  
We must willingly combine subjective efforts and objective world , theory and practice , and inheritance and development of legacies , deepen our understanding of the laws governing the running of the government by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and human society so that we think and act more in line with the national condition at the initial stage of socialism and the requirements of the development of the times and think and act more in line with the actual conditions in Jiangsu Province and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
Besides , the Corps has also mapped out a series of rules and regulations , renovated and transformed the bulk of its installations , correspondingly erected a number of facilities of a preliminary scale , and introduced a whole set of automatic management systems , thus bringing about a leap forward for operational positions management , from human operations to automated operations .  
Since the 1991 Gulf War , the US and British aircraft have been flying on patrol missions in two " no-fly zones , " set up over the north and south of Iraq respectively , frequently striking at various civilian and military targets in Iraq , and resulting in losses in human life and property .  
A few local businesses and blood banks acted without authorization in Henan to set up clinics that collected plasma only , and operated in violation of regulations , collecting large amounts of plasma and purchasing raw plasma .  This resulted in the human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] being spread widely among the throng who sold blood at these clinics , with Wenlou Village , in Shangcai County 's Lugang Township , being one of the villages with the most serious epidemic conditions .  
As has been learned from relevant departments in mid-August , the Second Artillery Corps has achieved fruitful results in its personnel construction thanks to ceaseless efforts in implementing the " human resources relay " project .  The average age of leaders of the major technological posts of all missile brigades as well as the research offices and the teaching and research offices of all scientific research institutes is about 40 , and 72 percent of them are under 40 years of age .  
Wu Hailong said that this year the APEC meeting discussed in depth trade and investment liberalization , strengthening of a multilateral trade structure , economic and technological cooperation , exploitation of human resources , and new economies , among other issues .  The results achieved in the meeting laid a sound foundation for the October informal APEC leaders ' meeting and ministerial meeting to be held in Shanghai .  
A case involving human life is to be treated with the utmost care .  Since the founding of new China , and especially since the launch of reforms and opening up , the Chinese Government has consistently attached extremely great importance to production safety ; it has organized and drawn up various laws and regulations , and laid down the guideline of " safety first , prevention first , " with the result that the state of production safety has gradually improved each year .  
Ministers and their representatives from member economies reached a common understanding on a wide range of issues , such as cooperation in advancing technological innovation , facilitating financing , improving the environment for SME development , strengthening SME human capacity building and interacting with the business sector , put forward many proposals for future growth , and adopted the Joint Ministerial Statement of the Eighth APEC SME Ministerial Meeting .  
He said : China persistently pursues an independent and peace-oriented foreign policy , developing friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , treating each other equally , enjoying mutual benefits , and jointly forging ahead the cause of human progress .  
Regarding the request made to the NPC to interpret the law , the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong people and foreigners who are truly concerned about Hong Kong have come to realize that had the SAR Government not promptly requested the NPC to interpret the law , 1.6 million mainlanders would have rushed into Hong Kong , causing tremendous unbearable impact on Hong Kong 's basic human rights , including rights in the areas of housing , education , medical service , and social order .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
The practices of ignoring the actual situation , criticizing the situation of human rights in other countries by wearing colored glasses , and even interfering in other countries ' domestic affairs under the pretext of " safeguarding " human rights , are in fact grossly trampling on human rights .  The move is not beneficial to the development of the international cause of human rights .  It also sabotages the North-South relations .  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
In the past year , the Chinese Government has made efforts to realize the people 's economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to promote and protect the citizens ' political rights , and has made remarkable progress in this respect , thus comprehensively raising the level of enjoying various human rights by the Chinese people .  
Modern human society is made up of numerous rules , and wars , as a normal human activity , have always been constrained by these rules ; certain kinds of warfare have always been prohibited .  The reason human beings have evolved from their primitive state to create nations and societies is that they have this kind of moral and compelling laws and rules and regulations .  
After the Cold War , although the United States ' military development has advanced to a level unprecedented in human history , the international rules and international order have remained in effect .  The Americans have not gone all out , like other imperial expansionists we are familiar with in world history , to forcefully establish hegemony based purely on military power similar to the kind we know in history .  
To safeguard the interests of their own bourgeois class , Western countries headed by the United States have used political , economic , and military means to enforce their political system , ideology , and human rights concept in the international community and to grossly interfere in the internal affairs and trample on the sovereignty of other countries .  
Fallacies such as " human rights above sovereignty " and " human rights have no national boundaries " are merely the false reasoning and excuses it uses for disregarding the international law and for grossly interfering in the internal affairs and unscrupulously encroaching on the sovereignty of other countries .  They are an open provocation against modern international law .  
The " one country , two systems " formula is a new attempt unprecedented in human history .  However , Hong Kong people have succeeded .  Besides overcoming the difficulties and burden left over by the colonial rulers , Hong Kong withstood the external economic storm as well as the attempt by internal and external forces to " resist China and throw Hong Kong into chaos " when it was not yet stable during the initial period after the handover .  
In accordance with the agreement on trade relations signed soon after China and the United States established diplomatic ties in 1979 , the two sides should mutually grant " MFN treatment " to each other .  However , the United States adopted the annual appraisal system for the " MFN treatment " for China in accordance with its relevant domestic law .  It further attached some conditions related to " human rights " in the process of implementation .  
The rich human resources , high proportion of young and middle-aged population , notable cost advantages , and the state 's measures to lighten the burdens of state-owned enterprises , divert surplus personnel to other jobs , and separate the functions of running social undertakings are all conducive to heightening labor productivity .  
That the United States has always ignored facts , played the same old tune , and slandered the situation of human rights in China and other developing countries is caused by its hegemonic mental state of Cold War mentality .  It has implemented its values and ideology with a strong sense of superiority , practiced dual standards on the human rights issue , and politicized the human rights issue .  
In the past 50 years since the founding of new China , especially in the past 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the level of the people 's material and cultural life has constantly been raised , and the human rights cause , being a part of these achievements , has also made comprehensive and concrete progress personally experienced by the Chinese people on the basis of the constant development of the economy in China .  
Even in the United States , which is the most developed country in the world , there are many problems in its human rights situation .  But the United States has never looked squarely at its own human rights problems , still less has it published an annual report on its own human rights situation .  Instead , it compiled a white paper on other country 's human rights in accordance with its own standards and its incorrect and partial data and used it as the means for interfering in other country 's internal affairs .  
The nation provides effective assurance , on a system , legal , and material level , for the enjoyment and realization of human rights , initially forming a socialist human rights safeguard system with special Chinese characteristics , and thus enabling Chinese human rights to truly possess a widespread , equal , and authentic nature .  
The Chinese constitution stipulates that the citizens enjoyment of full and extensive human rights is the basic right and freedom making up the chief content of human rights ; the constitution stipulates that when the citizens execute their rights and freedoms , they can not harm the national , societal , or collective interests , nor impinge on the freedom and rights of other citizens ;  
Regarding the request made to the NPC to interpret the law , the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong people and foreigners who are truly concerned about Hong Kong have come to realize that had the SAR Government not promptly requested the NPC to interpret the law , 1.6 million mainlanders would have rushed into Hong Kong , causing tremendous unbearable impact on Hong Kong 's basic human rights , including rights in the areas of housing , education , medical service , and social order .

Li Tieying pointed out : The western regions have rich hydropower , mineral , and biological resources and numerous sites of human civilization and natural scenery .  Many industries have established a good foundation in the regions .  
Nevertheless , with a guilty conscience , he did not dare to use expressions like " two countries " but carefully chose a neutral expression such as " the two sides of the Taiwan Straits . " He said that " the same historical experiences should have laid a solid foundation for the people living on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits to gain mutual understanding and commonly seek freedom , democracy , human rights , . .  
As the US bill contains clauses that attempt to use human rights and other pretexts to interfere in China 's internal affairs and damage China 's interests , the Chinese side has called on the US side to conscientiously observe the three Sino-US joint communiques and the basic norms of international relations in order to ensure that Sino-US relations , as well as economic and trade exchanges , will develop in a healthy and stable direction .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
On the other hand , the desire for peace , cooperation , and development has become an irresistible trend of the times .  The voice of the vast numbers of developing countries demanding dialogue and countering confrontation , safeguarding the purpose and principles of the UN Charter , and fighting against the use of human rights to meddle in the internal affairs of other countries , is running high .  
The Tibet issue has all along been a " human rights " hot spot ; even then the CSHRS has not evaded this difficult issue but instead has expounded , with a host of facts , on the great changes that have taken place since Tibet implemented the democratic reform and wiped out the feudal serfdom to refute the Dalai clique and international hostile forces ' distortions of and attacks on Tibet 's human rights situation .  
Meanwhile , the CSHRS must continue to take an active part in international human rights activities ; conduct more dialogues , exchanges , and cooperation with foreign organizations and personages ; and make unremitting efforts to enhance understanding and cooperation between the Chinese people and the peoples of all countries in the world in upholding human rights , expand consensus unceasingly , and jointly promote the international community 's universal respect of human rights and basic freedom .  
His aim and sinister ambition was to portray himself as a saint protecting the democracy and human rights of the 23 million people of Taiwan and to imply that the government of the Chinese mainland and the CPC , which oppose his criminal behavior , are an autocratic devil opposed to democracy and human rights , in a bid to stir up bad feeling between the Taiwan compatriots and the mainland of the motherland and pin on it the responsibility for the tense situation in the Taiwan strait and for a possible war .  
In particular , when its features of opposing the KMT 's autocratic and despotic rule and opposing the CPC 's and communism 's deprivation of democracy and human rights emerge , lured by the fragrant " western meal " of " democracy and human rights , " the program is powerfully bewitching and deceptive , and thus gained support and adherents .  
The anti-China activities of " Taiwan independence thinkers " were coordinated with those of western anti-China political forces and human rights organizations , with east and west singing in tune ; they groundlessly labelled the mainland of the motherland as " opposed to democracy and human rights " ; for instance they frequently applied their self-flaunted " democracy and human rights " to abuse the CPC 's opposition to " Taiwan independence " as oppressing Taiwan with " nationalism " and " great Han chauvinism . "  
It is still unknown whether the reform of the new Taiwan authorities , centered on and motivated by " democracy and human rights , " will be effective in the economic sphere to again achieve a miracle in the free market economy .  However , it is conceivable that this reform of " democracy and human rights " and " rule by law " will objectively bring greater troubles for the motherland 's peace and reunification in disregard of the people 's will .  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
It is conceivable that the series of matters on international human rights that were given assurance in Chen Shui-bian 's inaugural speech will surely bring forth unprecedented warm relations between them and international anti-China forces and human rights organizations , and lead to international human rights organization conducting activities in Taiwan " legally , " thereby winning direct and indirectly new support and protection for " Taiwan independence . "  
More importantly , Chen Shui-bian publicly announced in his inaugural speech that he would hold high the " human rights above sovereignty " banner and continue to carry forward and explore the potential of the " democracy and human rights " weapon , and is prepared to cooperate closely with international human rights organizations of the West and Amnesty International and actively participated in international NGO 's .  
Of equal importance is the fact that we must use practical and effective measures to deal with the Taiwan authorities in international " human rights above sovereignty " activities .  In particular , regarding the activities they carry out in western countries , we must have a plan for response , we must take initiative , and we must have a definite scope and counterpoint .  
When elucidating the human rights situation of the motherland of China , it is very correct to emphasize that the right to survive is fundamental .  However , explaining " democracy and human rights " to the Taiwan compatriots is even more complicated , and is also very difficult to manage .  But , this is possibly much more powerful than guided missiles , so it is worth striving to try to do .  
Deng Xiaoping advanced the theory on the implementation of the open policy in socialist states and took the open policy as a basic national policy on China 's socialist construction .  To gain advantages comparable with that of capitalism , Deng noted , socialism should boldly absorb and use all civilized achievements created by human society , including developed capitalist states ' advanced operational and managerial approaches that reflect the law of modern socialized production .  
Li Peng said : China similarly respects the general principle of the international community on human rights .  However , we feel that as countries have different social systems , economic conditions , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , and religious beliefs , they do not share an identical understanding of human rights .  This is very natural .  
In the past 50 years , the Chinese Government has not only basically provided enough food and clothing for 1.2 billion people and greatly raised the people 's living standards , but also allowed the people to enjoy civil , political , economic , social , cultural , and educational rights on the basis of the Constitution and law .  We can say that China 's current human rights situation is in the best period in history .  
since our party represents the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , it must persistently take Marxism as the guide , inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , study and absorb all the fruits of human civilization , and continually build and create socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , so that material and spiritual civilization will develop in coordinated fashion and promote the all-round progress of society ;  
It is said that in April a joint smuggling scheme between the Shanghai Airport and Port was uncovered , and five Chinese businessmen holding fake passports for small African countries were detained and interrogated .  Their backgrounds involved an international human smuggling ring stretching across Asia and Africa and also included diplomatic officials of African nations .  
The Chinese Government 's stance in opposing illegal human smuggling and illegal immigration has always been specific , and China has always adopted the attitude of active cooperation with the countries concerned in handling illegal immigration ; China will take back those verified to be Chinese citizens who had left mainland China .  
In April and June , Shanghai 's police departments successively launched two united campaigns , " making concerted efforts to crack down on human traders and to rescue women and children who have been kidnapped and sold . "  Over 10,000 people 's policemen and public security joint vigilance committee personnel daily joined in the campaigns and arrested 27 human traders .  
The incident in which the dead bodies of Chinese stowaways were discovered at Dover , Britain , several days ago has shocked the international community .  In the view of the official , the incident shows it is highly necessary to step up international cooperation in cracking down on the human smuggling crimes instigated by snakeheads .  
However , since the international community has failed to launch a forceful crackdown on organized international criminal gangs owing to the loopholes in the laws of certain countries , such as " political asylum " and " respect for human rights , " the activities of illegal migration have been revived like dying cinders glowing again and have persisted despite repeated prohibitions , thus doing tremendous harm to the society .  
As regards human rights , Li Peng has stressed and pointed out : It is impossible to demand that various countries follow the same viewpoint or mechanically transplant the same mode on the question of human rights , for human rights is an integral concept , and complete and common human rights should include not only the political rights of citizens but also the economic , social , and cultural rights , especially the right of survival and the right of development . 
Chen Shui-bian calls the mainland 's struggle against " Taiwan independence " hegemonism , and has confused state sovereignty with human rights .  He has attempted to sow dissension among the compatriots in Taiwan , the international community , and the mainland , and publicly promoted official relations between Taiwan and the United States , in addition to meddling with the social and political affairs of the mainland .  
repeatedly talked nonsense at international occasions ; made malicious and entirely groundless accusations against the policy of the Chinese Government towards Tibet ; and wantonly spread such rumors as that " the human rights situation in Tibet is deteriorating , " " the Tibetan culture has become extinct , " and " there is no religious freedom in Tibet , " thus turning himself into a " master of wild lies . "  
President Jiang Zemin delivered a written speech at the airport .  He said mankind is looking forward to the dawn of the 21st century , adding that people hope this century will be a century of peace and development , for the establishment of a new , just and rational international political and economic order in this century , and for brilliant human civilization in this century .  
In his " 20 May " inaugural speech , he made a comprehensive paraphrase of the new middle-of-the-road line and maintained that it would be a road leading Taiwan to a heavenly state as " an example in democracy and human rights in the world . "  After assuming presidency , he has also indeed worked hard for it .  
The new middle-of-the-road line is a complete " Taiwan independence " theory and strategic program , its core idea is the so-called " democracy and human rights , " and its ultimate purpose and actual intention are to avert the debate over reunification and independence , solidify the foundation and strength for the " Taiwan independent " mindset , and comprehensively counter the one China principle with a new form and scale .  It is in reality a vicious conspiracy of de facto " Taiwan independence . "  
Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
6 .  All sides indicate they will resolutely uphold the purpose and principles of the UN Charter ; restate the legitimate rights of all countries to choose their own paths of political , economic , and social development according to their national conditions ; oppose intervention in other countries ' internal affairs on the pretexts of " humanitarianism " and " protecting human rights ; " and support the efforts of one another in safeguarding the five countries ' national independence , sovereignty , territorial integrity , and social stability .  
Kok appreciated the achievements scored by China in human rights .  Because of the differences in historic , economic , and social development between various countries , it is very important for them to carry out constructive dialogue based on mutual respect .  
Wei Ruixing pointed out : The Chinese Government has banned the " Falungong " evil cult in accordance with law , and punished a very small number of the cult-related criminals who have brought about serious harm to society .  The Chinese Government has protected the human rights and freedom of the broad masses of the people in China , and safeguarded the stability of social order as a result .  The practice has won support from the broad masses of the Chinese citizens , and is completely legal and rightful .  
For this reason , Jamyang maintained that the human society should work together to eradicate misunderstanding ; should remove negative factors impairing economic development ; and should create a favorable environment for economic development so as to create conditions for protecting or developing the cultural heritage of nationalities .  
As reflected in various localities , in the past , some enterprises with a fairly great number of retired workers had to assign a person to take charge of issuing pensions every month , and this wasted a lot of human and material resources .  After the implementation of socialized distribution of pensions , the management of retirees will be separated from enterprises ; the burdens of enterprises will be greatly reduced and their operational vitality will be noticeably strengthened .  
4 .  To provide highly proficient talents essential for transforming science and technology into products and industrializing high technologies , we have set up scientific mechanisms governing personnel hiring , created an environment that can retain talented personnel , and intensified our efforts in developing human resources .  We have drawn up the " Beijing Regulations for Encouraging Students Studying Abroad To Come to Beijing To Start Their Pioneering Businesses . " The project of recruiting proficient high-tech personnel from all parts of the country is going on .  
In particular , in the contemporary world , from nature to human society , from the economic and political realms to culture and science , things are developing and changing at a speed unimaginable to people in the previous periods .  
Shen Guofang pointed out that the summit would adopt a final document .  Many Western nations maintain that in the upcoming new century , the idea of human rights overriding everything should be included in the document .  However , most of the developing nations , including China , are against this formulation and hold that resolutely safeguarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity should be written in the document , instead .  
when the government of the special zone submitted a proposal to the National People 's Congress to " explain the law " in order to check the possibility of the appearance of a human wave sweeping Hong Kong , they declared " the rule of law is dead . "  In the legislature they wore white flowers [ a symbol of mourning ] and left the arena .  
President Jiang also profoundly analyzed the impact of economic globalization on human society , and appealed to the international community to adopt practical and effective measures to open markets to the developing countries , transfer technology , reduce and waive debt , and increase official development aid , so as to narrow the north-south gap .  
Li Peng stressed : China and Russia share extensive common interests ; and have had fruitful cooperation in a series of major international issues in recent years , including human rights , the anti-missile issue [ fan dao ] , arms control , and the reform of the United Nations . Such cooperation should go on in the future . 
From April to July this year , the ministry mobilized public security organs to conduct a massive special struggle of cracking down on traders in human beings to rescue women and children abducted for sale .  With the vigorous support of all sides in the society , public security organs at all levels meticulously organized and planned their action , and the large number of public security and people 's police officers worked unceasingly hard and struggled arduously .  
The source also revealed that since the First Branch of the Beijing Municipal People 's Procuratorate took over Li Jizhou 's case from a special investigation team set up by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission in mid-June of this year , the procuratorial organs concerned have carried out investigations or collected evidence for more than three months .  The authorities have confirmed from both the human testimony and material evidence available that Li Jizhou is a suspect who has taken a huge amount of bribes by abusing his power through shielding smuggling ; issuing licenses to smuggled vehicles ;  
What warrants people 's special attention at present is that as tough measures are unworkable , they are replaced by soft measures such as intervention in the name of humanitarianism , human rights overriding sovereignty , human rights prevailing over everything , and global intervention without boundaries .  
It is necessary to firmly implement the strategy of relying science and education for national regeneration , greatly promote scientific and technological innovation and progress , effectively development human resources , and provide strong driving forces for economic growth and social progress .  
He said : In the contemporary era , new knowledge keeps emerging in vast multitude , science and technology are advancing with each passing day , and the social productive forces are considerably elevated , which have produced enormous impacts on the world 's political , economic , cultural , and social lives , so that human beings are confronted with new , tremendous historical changes and leaps .  
As the industrial structure continues to be optimized , the level of coordination and cooperation between central-western regions and the eastern part of the country will also be continuously upgraded ; the traditional mode of interaction between the resource supplying bases and processing bases will be broken down ; and all-dimension exchanges in capital , technology , human resources , and information will take place between the eastern and western regions .  
The development of human society tells us that crime is a factor hindering social stability and progress .  It undermines the normal operation of political structures , the correct implementation of state laws and regulations , disturbs social order , and corrodes people 's moral character and spiritual world .  
Scientific discoveries move people to form scientific principles in the process of understanding the world , while the mission of engineering and technological sciences is to transform scientific principles into dynamic forces to remold the world .  Engineering and technological sciences form the bridge between scientific discoveries and industrial development , and they are powerful levers for industrial revolutions , economic development , and social progress .  Watt 's invention of the steam engine triggered the first industrial revolution and had a far-reaching and profound impact on human society .  
The highly effective application of aerospace technology in the fields of telecommunications , broadcast , meteorology , resources , satellite navigation and orientation , and so on has brought about tremendous changes in human productive forces and lifestyles and pushed forward economic development and social progress .  
After comparing the completely different prospects for the stock markets across the Taiwan strait , Kao Ching-yuan , chairman of Taiwan 's President Group , and Wang You-zen , chairman of Taiwan 's Libar group , pointed out in a clear-cut manner at a forum sponsored by the TAIEX and attended by heads of Taiwan 's listed companies that the free fall of Taiwan 's stock market was not due to the economic factors .  Wang You-zen was more direct , saying " human factor " was the cause of Taiwan 's stock market blue .  
As the primary productive forces , science and technology are growing and expanding rapidly in the fields ranging from synthetic insulin to the cultivation of hybrid rice high-yield variety , and from human genome plan to the basic research and development of nanometer technologies , and the contribution rate of scientific and technological progress to the national economic growth has rapidly risen to nearly 40 percent .  
He said : Syria is one of the first Arab states that established diplomatic ties with China . It is also an important and influential country in the Middle East . China has all along attached importance to developing friendly relations with Syria and has spoken highly of Syria 's long-term firm support for China on the issues of human rights and Taiwan .  
We should unswervingly arm the minds of young cadres with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought and , in particular , Deng Xiaoping Theory , foster their fine style with the party 's fine traditions and strict management , enhance their professional level with modern scientific and technological knowledge and the fine achievements of civilization created by human society , and heighten the quality of young cadres in all respects , so as to guarantee that the cause of socialist modernization will be carried forward and forged ahead in a pioneering spirit .  
It has also strengthened the execution and supervision of the state compulsory norms and established a report system .  Generally speaking , the quality of the immigration project is good .  However , there are still some problems , such as the relatively poor quality of the design results , the nonstandard invitation of bidding , the undertaking of projects by the units without human quality , the replacement of supervision with quality inspection , and the improper punishment to the persons responsible for causing quality accidents .  
Under a new situation , we always insist on the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture and push the prosperous development of socialism 's culture and art to satisfy the growing need for peoples ' cultural spirit , and provide the insured thoughts , motives of spirit and intellectual support for economic development and improvement of the whole society , and build a nice social atmosphere and human cultural circumstance , above are honorable and difficult historical responsibilities of the cultural and art workers .  
Reportedly , the Chinese Government has attached importance to the development of human and social sciences .  " Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend , " encouraging academic exchanges with foreign countries , and intensifying research on international cooperation are the guiding principles for China 's efforts to develop and enliven human and social sciences .  
During the 1992 presidential election , Clinton condemned President Bush Sr . for ingratiating himself with the " Beijing butchers . "  After taking office , Clinton , as expected , was very tough with the CPC on human rights issues and threatened to link bilateral trade relations with human rights after taking office .  Only when bilateral relations worsened dramatically did Clinton begin to revise his strategy .  
The fifth plenary session of the 15th party central committee , which was held not long ago , regarded the development of human resources as an important strategic task that determines the future of China , and explicitly proposed that " qualified personnel are the most valuable resources , " and the " leading personnel are the crucial elements that carry on past traditions and open up a way to forge ahead into the future . "  
We advise the United States to give prime consideration to the general situation of Sino-US relations , truly act according to the three Sino-US joint communiques and the basic norms of international relations , stop interfering in China 's internal affairs using the Taiwan , Tibet , human rights , and other issues , and not do anything harmful to Sino-US relations .

The " Falungong " and other cults worship their founders in a big way and cook up false reasoning and heresies to profane human dignity , to jeopardize social stability , and to hoodwink the good and honest masses in an attempt to achieve their evil , ulterior , anti-human , anti-social , and anti-science purposes .  
They should be good at learning from and drawing on all the outstanding achievements of human civilizations and at inheriting and carrying forward all the outstanding ideas , morals , and cultural traditions of the Chinese nation ; they should effectively resist the corroding influence of all negative , decadent ideologies and cultures and always maintain the socialist mental outlook .  
It was stressed at the eighth APEC informal leadership meeting that APEC needs to enhance economic and technological cooperation centered on human capacity building and human resource development so as to narrow gaps between member states and to realize common development .  
Today , all we 're doing , such as conducting economic construction , building spiritual civilization , building democracy , and building a legal system , are in the final analysis aimed at ensuring that the 1.2 billion Chinese people will live and work in peace and contentment and will fully enjoy all types of human rights and basic freedoms .  
Since the founding of the New China , the Chinese Government has constantly been working hard to protect and develop human rights , and has made unremitting efforts to eliminate poverty and backwardness , to build a wealthy and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization , and to realize the ideal of human rights .  Great achievements have also been made in this regard .  
Economic globalization is the necessity of the development of large-scale socialized production , and is the new height and stage of this development , in which resources and social production factors are allocated in the most effective way on a global scale .  It represents the most advanced production mode and productive force hitherto seen in human society and will become the economic base of world peace , universal harmony , and the future new society of mankind .  
in particular , political forces standing for human rights and environmental protection and opposing free trade have continually expanded , with the result that it was very difficult for Gore to build a broad and close-knit Democratic Party campaign alliance . 
second , for the first time it set out comprehensive , systematic , and effective frameworks for handling bilateral relations , from the leaders ' hot line to the mechanism for dialogue on human rights , and from military exchanges to cooperation in law enforcement .  
while trade unions , environmental protection and human rights organizations within the Democratic Party are quite active in recent years , opposing free trade and intensifying their liberal stand on many social issues .  
The Chinese Government and people are speeding up reforms of the economic and political systems , putting into effect an economic and social development strategy geared to the 21st century , and practicing an administrative strategy of ruling the country according to law and building a state with legal system .  All this is in the final analysis aimed at fundamentally and continually improving the state of human rights in China .  
To improve the quality of workers and provide effective human resources support for the sustained and fast development of the national economy is a strategic task for the labor security cause .  Zhang Zuoji said : For some time to come , it is necessary to regard the vocational qualification certificate system as the point of breakthrough for the improvement of the quality of workers and popularize the vocational qualification certificate system in a comprehensive way .  
The backward steps of Taiwan 's authorities have caused relations across the Strait to constantly worsen , and have led to disorder and loss of confidence on the island .  As a result , investment has stagnated , the economy has gone into a recession , there has been a huge outflow of capital and human resources , and the stock market has plummeted to a nearly five-year low , with a closing figure yesterday of 4721 points .  Things are tight all over , and the unemployment rate is reaching a 15-year record high .  
Ambassador Li said , certain American politicians are still interfering in China 's internal affairs with regard to issues such as Tibet , religion , and human rights , or else pursuing double standards , and preaching the " theory of the China threat " heedless of the facts ; this is particularly harmful and dangerous .  
In short , we should vigorously facilitate the rational circulation and optimum allocation of production elements to ensure that material , financial , and human resources are turned to best account and bring into full play the role of markets and resources at home and abroad in the large-scale western development .  
They sedulously arranged for the " Falun Gong " elements to spread the fantastic rumor about the Chinese Government 's persecution of the " Falun Gong " followers at the hearing on the so-called " human rights issues in China and Tibet , " held by the US Congress Foreign Relations Committee , and invited Li Hongzhi 's right-hand assistants and " pro-democracy " and " Tibetan independence " elements to attend the hearing on the so-called " issues of religious freedom in China , " to prepare public opinion for the anti-China proposal .  
This cult organization has moved against the historical current , is completely antagonistic to the scientific world , has tarnished human civilization , and has obstructed social progress .  These have determined its inevitable fate of a rapid destruction .  
In order to preserve social stability and tranquillity and protect basic human rights and freedoms , the Chinese Government has banned the " Falungong " organization and punished according to law a very small number of lawless and criminal elements ; and it has carried out thorough and meticulous work to educate and convert the great majority of those who were led astray , to enable them to return to a normal life .  
The Ugandan Government adheres to an one-China policy , supports China 's grand cause of cooperation , and has coordinated with and supported China on such major international issues as human rights and anti-missile treaties .  We would like to express our appreciation and gratitude for all this , and we are satisfied with the current development of our bilateral relations .  
They were shocked by and indignant at such an organized and planned scheme , claiming that this incident once again unmasked " Falungong 's " antihuman and antisocial essence of cruelly injuring or killing the people and trampling on human rights .  
In the incident , several people obsessed with " Falungong , " who were under the spiritual control of Li Hongzhi , attempted to burn themselves to death , turning a blind eye to both love in the world and love in their families and displaying not the least virtue or intuitive knowledge as human beings , and have thus destroyed themselves , their families , and their children as well .  
The self-immolation incident created by several obsessed " Falungong " practitioners on the eve of the Chinese New Year at Tiananmen Square shocked people in all circles and aroused righteous resentment .  People in the overseas Chinese affairs circles today held a meeting to strongly condemn the " Falungong " evil cult 's crime of inhumanely trampling upon human lives .  
The political system may vary from one country to another , but all countries in the world share the same task of cracking down on evil cults and drug trafficking .  He called on all nations in the world to make joint efforts to thoroughly eliminate evil cults and drugs by casting aside their political differences and join hands in building a healthier and better living environment for all human being and creating a clean world without drugs , without pollution , without evil cults , and without spiritual opium for future generations .  
Participating jurists pointed out that Li Hongzhi and his evil " Falungong " cult were the plotters and instigators of the case in which a number of stubborn " Falungong " members set themselves on fire at Tienanmen Square . By doing so these " Falungong " members did themselves bodily harm , abused human rights , and seriously broke China 's criminal law .  It is necessary to crack down on these people according to law to guard the authority and sanctity of the law and to maintain political stability and unity .  
The open letter emphasized : " The Chinese Government 's ban of the cultish organization of ' Falungong ' is a correct measure and the actual deed to safeguard the country 's political power and social stability , the sound mind and body of the people and the personal interests of the Chinese people .  It is to uphold the basic human rights of the Chinese people , which is purely an internal affair of China . "  
In February , 2000 , the French Government 's Interministerial Committee on Opposing Evil Cults published its annual report , explicitly defining for the first time an " evil cult " as : " An organization formed in an arbitrary way , which follows a certain religious goal ( no matter whether or not such a goal is made public ) and carries out activities harmful to human rights or social equilibrium . "  
Four senior officials meetings will be held this year .  The upcoming meeting will discuss the economic situation in the Asia-Pacific region , globalization , the new economy , and other issues of common concern .  It also will study , while ensuring the process of APEC 's trade and investment liberalization , how to push forward economic and technological cooperation and carry out regional cooperation in capacity building and exploitation of human resources .  
The experts pointed out : For some time , the " Falungong " cult has created the worship of its founder , exercised spiritual control , concocted heresies , formed secret associations , accumulated wealth by unfair or illegal means , inflicted mortal injuries on human lives , and trampled on human rights .  These are acts in serious violation of the relevant Chinese laws .  
As a cultural system , each religion has drawn on the numerous spiritual assets created in the history of human civilization to become an important part of traditional culture and a way of life for its believers .  Religion has become a stabilizing force in society , playing a unique role in coordinating or balancing various spheres of activity in society .  
Observation team members briefed some 20 overseas Chinese representatives on China 's policy regarding the development of its western regions as well as their economic , scientific , and technological structures , the distribution of natural and human resources , and other characteristics and strong points , adding that the development of China 's western regions serves as an opportunity for them to display their talents , hoping that they will introduce advanced French science , technology , and management to these regions .  
At a news conference after the end of the meeting , Wang Guangya said : the senior officials of all participating economic entities unanimously agreed that APEC should advance economic and technological cooperation in the fields of energy construction and human resources while maintaining the momentum of the process of trade and investment liberalization , and should make efforts to start a new round of multilateral trade talks as early as possible on the basis of formulating a balanced agenda .  
A few days ago , 36 cultural organizations in Hong Kong held an " anti-Falungong " forum to pass a solemn statement on opposing " Falungong " and to sternly condemn " Falungong " as a heretical organization slandering science and opposing the motherland , society , and human beings .  
The " record , " citing the US election campaign and other detailed examples , lays bare the myth of American " democracy " and completely brings to light its escalating violence , unfair judicature , the widening gap between the rich and the poor , worrying economic and social rights of workers , serious gender discrimination , children being in a grim situation , unchanged racial discrimination , bad benefits for minorities , exhausting all resources for military buildup , and brutal infringements on other countries ' human rights .  
As all people know , uranium is a radioactive super-heavy metal , but the United States flatly denied that depleted uranium bombs may have harmful effects on the human health , and obstructed the investigations conducted by the relevant countries and international organizations .  
For other international human rights treaties it has joined , the United States always made reservation , statements , and understanding to ensure that their implementation would be strictly limited within the scope of the US Constitution and other laws , and could only be applied to the federal level and could not be applied to various states .  As a result , the international covenants are a sheer sheet of meaningless paper in the United States .  
Talking about the relationship between handling Falungong and guaranteeing human rights , Liu said : The policy of the Chinese government in handling the Falungong problem is to unite with , educate , and saving most of the practitioners who have been deceived .  The Chinese government has punished a small handful of people in the Falungong cult because they have engaged in illegal and criminal activities , disrupted public order , and violated the Chinese law .  
With the unremitting efforts over a long time , the Chinese people 's living standard has been unprecedentedly improved and the human rights and basic freedoms they enjoy have been raised to an unprecedented high level .  The human rights situation has reached its best period in history and this is a fact obvious to all .  
That the Chinese Government has banned and cracked down on the " Falungong " cult organization according to law is precisely to safeguard and protect the basic human rights and freedoms of the Chinese citizens , and this has won the resolute support of all the people in China and the extensive support of the international community .  
This is also a typical expression of the dual standards for human rights of the United States . China expresses its strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition [ qiang lie bu man he jian jue fan dui ] to this move made by the United States . We demand that the United States abide by the basic norms of international relations , correct its wrongdoings and stop using so-called human rights issues to interfere in China 's internal affairs .  
Liu Jing said : The decision of the Chinese Government on banning " Falungong " was based on the demand of the broad masses and was aimed at safeguarding social stability and protecting the people 's basic human rights and freedoms .  The action has sufficient legal grounds and is completely in keeping with the legal procedures .  
The Chinese Government has always respected the international community 's universal principle on human rights and has actively worked to promote and protect the Chinese people 's human rights and basic freedoms , and tremendous results that have drawn worldwide attention have been achieved .  
Using high technologies , starting from on high to deal with China in the outer space to attract China 's attention , making it concentrate its entire financial , material and human resources , as the former Soviet Union did , on an arms race in the outer space .  Then , cutting the ground from under China 's foot , completely do China in .  Such kind of calculations based on wishful thinking , to be sure , is also very laughable .  
Zeng Jianhui , member of the NPC standing committee and chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee , said : " China has always acknowledged and respected the universal principles of human rights of the international community , committed itself to the promotion and protection of the human rights and basic liberties of its citizens in accordance with its national conditions , and actively facilitated dialogue , exchange , and cooperation in the area of human rights in the international community . "  
He said : The NPC standing committee conducted three rounds of careful deliberations on this treaty within a rather short time and ratified it today .  This is further proof of China 's consistent principled position of attaching importance to the promotion and protection of human rights and of actively advocating and conducting , in a committed way , cooperation in the area of human rights .  
Education lays a foundation for developing human resources , and plays a leading and across-the-board influential role in economic and social development .  We must more effectively carry out the strategy of relying on science and education when pursuing national regeneration .  
equipment is obsolete and outmoded ; technical and professional human resources are insufficient .  The unreasonable distribution of public health resources in rural areas has affected the development of public health undertakings in the vast countryside .  
Jiangsu must seize this opportunity to implement the strategy of relying on science and education to invigorate the country , energetically develop human resources , and promote scientific and technological progress and innovation in order to turn itself into a province with strong scientific and technological resources and provide a powerful driving force for structural readjustment and economic development .  
Deputy Zhang Baoyi , mayor of Zhangjiakou City , said : This is an amazing achievement .  These years , the work of aiding the poor to tackle difficult problems has been done as an important task from the central to local levels , and actual results have been achieved from formulating policies to inputting human , financial , and material resources into this work .  
In the vast central and west region , the natural and human resources are abundant , the operational costs are cheap , the domestic markets are huge , and the scientific and technological development and manufacturing industry have also had considerable foundations .  
When talking about compulsory education , Li Peng pointed out : The new century will be an epoch marked by the great and rapid development of high technologies .  The competition of comprehensive national strength will be determined by the quality of the nationals to a large degree .  The key for development lies in human resources , and education is the foundation .  So it is necessary to put education in a prominent position .  
Some leading cadres , in pursuit of achievements in their official careers , engage in numerical tricks , submit false statistics to the higher authorities , and force the lower levels for high statistical figures , giving rise to local boastfulness , wasting hosts of human , material , and financial resources , and ruining the people 's interests .  
Luo Gan said : The Chinese party and government have always attached great importance to developing good neighborliness , friendship , and all-round cooperation with Vietnam , regarding the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two parties and two countries as not only the demand for invigorating the Chinese national economy and promoting reform and the socialist modernization drive , but also the demand for maintaining regional peace and the peace of the world at large and advancing the cause of human progress .  
The current constitution in Japan was promulgated in November 1946 and implemented starting from May 1947 .  The fundamental idea of the constitution is to forfeit warfare , and support the idea of people having the right to make their own decisions , in addition to guaranteeing the basic human rights .  
We will further popularize advanced and applicable technologies , step up the development of human , scientific , and technological resources , and solve outstanding problems in economic and social development through scientific and technological innovation .  
Through visiting the United States and west Europe and receiving a number of European and US parliamentary delegations visiting China , we have continued to hold friendly and frank dialogue on the Taiwan issue , human rights , religious issues , and China 's WTO accession , thus further promoting mutual understanding and expanding consensus .  
The Chinese Government banned Falungong in accordance with the law for the very purpose of safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .  By dragging the overwhelming majority of Falungong practitioners back to normal social life from the dangerous " realm , " it has saved the lives of many obsessed practitioners and reflected the strong sense of responsibility it , as a staunch human rights protector , has toward people 's lives .  
The spokesman reiterated that the Chinese Government respects human rights and the universal principles of human rights , and starting from China 's concrete national conditions , it has consistently devoted itself to promoting and protecting the human rights and fundamental liberties of the people of China .  
Jiang Zemin gave positive assessment to the development of bilateral relations between China and Djibouti over the past 22 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations , and expressed appreciation and gratitude to Djibouti for its consistent efforts to promote friendship with China and for the valuable support it gave to China for a long time over the Taiwan issue , the human rights issue , and other major international issues .  
After entering the 21st century , the deepening of interdependence between nations has surpassed the limit of human historical experiences , and a " global community " has dimly appeared in an embryonic form .  It is time for the United States , as the designer and protector for the security and economic order of the international community , to discard the diplomatic pattern of self-centered unilateralism and to rely on the coordinating and managing functions of multilateralism .  
Therefore , whether to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan or to expand Sino-U.S . bilateral trade , whether to condemn China for suppressing human rights or to obstruct China from acceding to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) - - all such means are used to achieve one objective , that is , to change the current social system in China . The United States ' national interests can be satisfied to the maximum only by achieving this objective .  
The developed countries are advanced in science and technology and strong in financial capital , while the developing countries are rich in natural and human resources and large in market potential .  
A set of administrative guidelines is being prepared for distribution to private and public hospitals , medical bodies and related organisations to advise those with the responsibility for transplant operations or importing of human organs intended for transplanting , of the relevant procedures and legislative requirements .  
" The rule of law continues to prevail and is being upheld ; people continues to enjoy the freedoms and rights they enjoyed in the past ; there has been no erosion of human rights ; public debates remain lively and demonstrations continue to be a natural part of everyday life ; the press continues to operate openly and freely ; the civil service is the same as it was , and the co - operation with the global and regional partners continues to develop and strengthen . "  
" During the remaining period of the trial , a visible presence of uniformed officers will be maintained on the streets of Hong Kong by the optimum use of human resources and the streamlining of existing work practices , including computer assisted information technology and communications .  
These included Japan 's economic recovery packages , financial and corporate sector restructuring , providing a catalyst for private capital flows , economic and technical co-operation , electronic commerce and ways to strengthen human resource development , economic infrastructure and the science and technological base .  
According to well recognised overseas studies , the coarse fraction of the total suspended particulates will lead to dirt and dust nuisance , and have no long term adverse effect on human health .  
Members are aware that in the 1998 / 99 Budget I announced last February and in the Chief Executive 's Policy Address last October , a wide range of measures to enhance Hong Kong 's productive capacity and competitive edge were set out .  They underline our resolve to seek greater achievements in science and technology , industrial innovation , infrastructure , development of human resources and efficiency and cost effectiveness of the government .  
We expect our educational systems and policies to bring up creative and adaptive young people who are ready to take up their responsibilities towards our society and our country .  We also expect to train up talents with an international outlook as well as a wide scope of knowledge and skills .  They must take pride in their lifelong zeal for learning , seek pleasure in enriching themselves and share the virtues of human beings , " Mr Tung said .  
We expect our educational systems and policies to bring up creative and adaptive young people who are ready to take up their responsibilities towards our society and our country .  We also expect to train up talents with an international outlook as well as a wide scope of knowledge and skills .  They must take pride in their lifelong zeal for learning , seek pleasure in enriching themselves and share the virtues of human beings .  
I believe we should put in hand an action plan which will highlight the importance of the social and human aspects of economic development , and the needd to address the concerns of the most vulnerable groups of our community and the action plan should incorporate specific projects and programmes which will draw on the best practices in individual economies and on the appropriate advice from business and labour as well as from international organisations . 
At about 4 pm , the 37-year-old driver , on reaching Man Kam To Control Point , tendered a manifest declaring a total of 5000 kilograms of frozen chickens on board his lorry .  Customs officers , however , found an extra 9000 kilograms of frozen chickens in the cargo compartment of the lorry .  The unmanifested chickens , which were not covered by any valid inspection certificate , were not suitable for human consumption after being examined by the inspectors of the Department of Health .  
We have learnt from the representatives of Guangdong and Shenzhen that the authorities concerned both at the provincial and municipal levels attach great importance to the issue .  They have stepped up the coordination of control point operation and have actively implemented a series of improvement measures such as enhancing human resources management and manpower deployment at the control points , acquiring new computer equipment and installing automatic electronic licence identification system etc .  Besides , an emergency coordination unit has also been set up at the Huanggang Control Point to promptly handle emergencies there .  
" The Advisers believe that Hong Kong is well placed to capitalise on its position as a global financial centre , given our strengths , quality physical infrastructure , resourcefulness of human capital and unique economic links with the Mainland , " he said . 
International speakers had been invited to Hong Kong to discuss what it means to be human and how human values are defined in the twenty-first century , together with the issues of our ( post ) information age , telecommunication and cybersphere , the anthropogenetic domain of built environment and material urban landscape , digital beings in a so-called post-human condition which humans have collectively created and inhabited .  
The Commission believes that Hong Kong 's long-term competitiveness will rest on its ability to maintain the highest quality human resources , a supportive environment for innovation and technology , excellent physical infrastructure , the freest and most open economy , a favourable business environment and respected and effective public institutions .  
In the race into the knowledge economy , Mr Tung expected that the middle class would benefit most relative to the rest as knowledge , brain power , or innovative human capital , was worth more than physical or financial capital in a knowledge economy . 
There is yet no scientific proof that genetically modified food ( GMF ) is unsafe for human consumption and as such , the public need not be alarmed over the reported presence of GMF in the local market .  
In an opening address , Director of FEHD Mrs Rita Lau said that although there was no scientific evidence so far to suggest that GM food was inherently harmful to human health , the Government was aware that there were different views held in the society on the subject and there was the demand for legislative control and labelling of GM food so as to enable consumers to make informed choice .  
With the high degree of autonomy given to Hong Kong under the Basic Law , the international community could be assured that their investments , their business dealings , their commercial contracts and their human rights and freedoms would continue to be protected by a legal system and an independent judiciary based on the common law .  
It sends an important message to the international community that their investments , their business dealings , their commercial contracts and their human rights and freedoms are protected by a trusted legal system and an independent judiciary based on English common law , " she noted .  
Internally , the Government will maintain the bedrock of its economic and trade policies , viz low taxes , free trade , free flow of information and the rule of law .  Building on such fundamental principles , we will keep upgrading our hardware ( infrastructure ) and software ( human resources and institutional framework ) in the continuous strive to sharpen our competitive edge and make perfect our business environment .  
However , despite the feverish probings and the virtually endless questioning and finger-pointing , the SAR Government can justifiably boast of an incredibly successful record in protecting human rights and defending its separate systems .  
" We aim to achieve our vision of international recognition of excellence as an integral part of the Hong Kong criminal justice system , through efforts in achieving value for money , public confidence , staff morale and public safety in the provision of quality custodial care and comprehensive rehabilitation programmes compatible with human dignity . "  
" The efforts of all those involved locally and internationally helped bring to a close - in a peaceful , orderly and compassionate way - one of the most poignant stories of mass migration in modern human history , " she said . 
Our well-established policy is to provide a favourable environment for business from a macro perspective , including first-rate infrastructure , quality human resources , a sound legal system , a fair competitive environment and efficient government services , etc .  
Six categories of S &amp; amp ; T statistics , which followed closely the recommendation of the OECD and with particular reference to the specific circumstances in Hong Kong , would be compiled .  They were statistics on ( i ) research and development inputs ; ( ii ) S &amp; amp ; T human resources ; ( iii ) patents ; ( iv ) external technology flows ; ( v ) S &amp; amp ; T publications ; ad ( vi ) technological innovation .  
The Administration has made relentless efforts in convincing the public and the Human Rights Committee that the provisions of the Public Order Ordinance are consistent with the human rights standards adopted internationally .  Bearing these principles in mind , I would now like to consider the following aspects of the current law , namely the requirement for notification ; the grounds on which public assemblies can be restricted or prohibited ; the sanctions for failure to give notice ; the penalties for such failure ; and the decision-making system .  
He said : " Apart from the continued orderly implementation of the Civil Service Reform measures which have already been announced , our work in the coming year will include strengthening the integrity of civil servants , improving communication between staff and management , promoting effective and appropriate human resource management practices and fostering the public 's trust and goodwill towards the Civil Service . "  
The Committee emphasised that interim measures were needed to enable employers , in particular multinational financial corporations , to recruit the employees that meet their corporate needs without having to resort to overseas talent or by moving their operations to alternative centres where suitable human resources were available .  
Meanwhile , they are deepening regional economic and technical cooperation , with emphasis on scientific and technological exchanges , human resources development and infrastructure construction .  They are working for a sound development of a multilateral trade regime so that they may complement one another .  
The crime cases involving human life are almost part of everyday 's news .  In solving a crime case , witnesses are , of course , crucial .  Besides , the dead body itself can also reveal critical physical evidence such as cause of death , sequence of events surrounding the death , and persons involving in the crime case .  Forensic science is what we call today to scientifically collect physical evidence of a crime for criminal detection .  
Reaching their hands into the pockets of Chekhov 's shorts , Theatre Smith-Gilmour found a myriad of familiar faces and mismatched human emotions and fueled them with their unique talents and trademark physical and comic magic .  Five bittersweet short stories by Anton Chekhov , the Russian master , come alive in their extraordinary adaptation of Chekhov 's Shorts .  
( b ) as several major mobile phone manufacturers have announced that they will set out information about the Specific Absorption Rates ( " SAR " ) , a measure of the amount of radiofrequency radiation absorbed by human bodies , of their newly released mobile phones on their packaging , whether it will consider stipulating the maximum permitted SAR value for mobile phones which are on sale in Hong Kong and setting it at the same level adopted by the US Federal Communications Commission i.e . 1.6W / kg ; and 
As for the longer-term challenges , Mr Tung said that central to our policy thinking and activities was how we could as a society best make the transition to a knowledge economy from our current starting point in the shortest time possible , ride the waves of progress of China with the greatest success and least economic and human dislocations , and adapt ourselves to the era of globalised competition and in the end come up with an economy that can perform brilliantly in the most demanding and competitive situations .  
* First , we must invest in human capital in a sustained manner and on a vast scale , sufficiently to form a deep , strong base of brainpower to support a knowledge economy with high value-added economic activities .  
In the light of the above , and given our low and simple taxation system , and the competing demands for resources to fund worthwhile human and social development programmes in the years ahead , we , the Government in conjunction with the community , need to carefully examine the long term sustainability of our existing social security schemes .  
This exhibition puts the light on the ubiquitous modern urban experience and reveals the specific schema of human , object and space .

Landslides are mainly caused by steep slopes or hillsides , weak weathered rock and rise of groundwater .  Furthermore , some human activities such as unauthorised cultivation , unprotected excavation also cause destruction to the slope surfaces .  As a result , rain water can infiltrate into the slope and soak the soil inside .  The slope then becomes unstable and landslides may easily occur .  
Nowadays , at any time and any place , numerous artificial satellites are bustling above our heads beyond the tranquil sky .  Unmanned spacecrafts bearing the most sophisticated equipment and cameras have been sent to study other members of the Solar System . However , human is superior to the best machine in many aspects .  
But most importantly , someday the Earth will be threatened by resources depletion , asteroid impacts or abrupt changes of solar activities .  Human will be forced to leave the Earth and find a new home in the endless Universe . To prepare for the challenges ahead , we need to understand the effects of prolonged weightlessness and living in confined environment on human 's physiology and psychology .  
To wild dolphins , human is the biggest threat to them apart from shark , its main predator .  Thousands of dolphins die everyday in fishing nets around the world .  What 's more , the seriously polluted environment makes dolphins increasingly vulnerable .  In view of that , many scientists , naturalists and marine biologists devote their lifetime to study dolphins , their mode of communication , foraging and social behaviors so as to preserve these graceful and extraordinary creatures .  
Teresa Wong , Xu Lei and Jyoji Sawada are among those nature lovers who attempt to retrieve the vibrant color of human spirits cultivated in the region through music from unusual perspectives .  The result is impressive and uncommon , with scores woven with the newly discovered charm of erhu and jazz instruments , bringing the audiences to music dream landscape of world music .  
And it will not condone any distinction , exclusion , restriction or preference based on race , colour , descent , or national or ethnic origin , which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition , enjoyment or exercise , on an equal footing , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural or any other field of public life , " Ms Chan explained .  
Regarding the provision of an accessible , affordable , expeditious and effective mechanism for individuals to seek redress and reparation for alleged violations of human rights , will the Executive Authorities inform this Council whether they have plans to establish an independent Human Rights Commission , with powers to investigate complaints about violation of human rights and to advise the Administration on whether a particular piece of proposed legislation is in compliance with international human rights standards ; if so , of the details of such plans ; if not , the reasons for that ?  
Human rights in Hong Kong are founded on the rule of law , an independent judiciary , the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance ( Cap . 383 ) which incorporated provisions of the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong in our domestic law and empowered the court to grant remedies for contravention of the Ordinance and a sound and comprehensive legal aid system that assures the individuals of access to the courts to seek redress and reparation for alleged violations of human rights .  
To ensure that the rights and freedoms enjoyed by local residents would not be diminished through the introduction of Article 23 , Mr Tong said that prior to putting the proposals to implement Article 23 for public consultation , the HKSAR Government has studied in detail existing laws , common law principles , relevant laws and jurisprudence in other jurisdictions , as well as international standards on the protection of human rights .  
While many larger foreign enterprises have advantages in capital , human and technical resources , professional knowledge , experience in project management and implementation , and international connection , Hong Kong enterprises also enjoy unique strengths in developing the telecommunications and IT markets in the Mainland . 
With accelerated economic globalisation and rapid advances in technology , corruption today transcends national boundaries , and has taken on a new dimension .  It has become a means to facilitate and perpetuate syndicated crimes , including international money laundering schemes , massive commercial fraud scams , cross-border drug trafficking , smuggling of human beings and many other serious crimes .  
" Meanwhile , there is no evidence to suggest that Canadian beef still on sale in the local market is unsafe as the Alberta incident appears to be an isolated case and beef already arrived has been certified by the Canadian authority to be originated from BSE-free cattle and is fit for human consumption , " the spokesman emphasized .  
A proper understanding of the existing law , and of the changes proposed by the Administration will , I believe , demonstrate that there is no cause to fear that human rights will be eroded , that the legislation will have a " chilling effect " on the media , that June 4 protests will be banned in the future , and so on . 
" All our proposals are entirely consistent with human rights protected by the Basic Law . The Bill provides that all its provisions must be interpreted , applied and enforced in accordance with Chapter III of the Basic Law , which mandates strict compliance with international standards on rights and freedoms , including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) .

In the true Vandekeybus style , " Blush " is about isolation and liberation .  It is confrontational and intensely physical .  Central to the piece is the human body : restless , unpredictable , powerful yet fragile .  
Bananas are among the oldest fruits in human history and still among the most popular . The Greeks began eating bananas brought from Africa more than four thousand years ago . Bananas are now popular around the world because they are sweet and delicious in flavor . They also are nutritious and rich in vitamins , protein , phosphorus and iron .  
It stressed that both leaders were gratified by the continuous development in political , economic and technical relations between their countries . They shared identical ideals and aspirations , the communique stated , believing as they did that the foundation of traditional friendship , based on high moral principles and fraternal solidarity , was both firm and enduring . The king and the president reaffirmed the common cause of their countries and peoples in upholding peace , freedom and human rights and opposing all forms of aggression , oppression and prejudice .  
The cylindrical shape of the trunks means they can be cut into identical segments for fashioning into the sets of products . Curved parts can be carved into screens , while twisted or gnarled branches can be shaped into the forms of animals or human figures .  
He further remarked that the Chinese people place equal emphasis on human nature , reasonableness and law . The work of the mediation council is based on the first two considerations , and the agreements it makes possible must have legal standing . Mayor Lee said that the function of mediation councils is a unique feature in the nation 's political history . He is convinced that once the mediation council fully develops its role , people will no longer need to go to the courts to settle their disputes .  
Li uses special machinery to replace human labor , creating slabs of so fine a texture that the grain of the slick wooden mold used for shaping is clearly visible on the surface of the product . As production increased , Li opened a number of " cultural service centers " in smaller towns to offer his products at close-to-cost prices . He also opened a gallery where calligraphers and painters may exhibit their works free of charge .  
The Republic of China is a law-abiding nation and as such does not in any way support or approve of illegal behavior . What must be considered in this case is that it is the autocratic , repressive regime on the mainland that so relentlessly controls all aspects of life , denying the basic human rights that are enjoyed in democratic countries that literally forced the six to use these means to seek their escape .  
Limited land and natural resources creates real problems for directing future industrial development of the nation 's economy . This , however , is offset by a fabulous pool of human resources reflected in a highly educated population and proportionally high percentage of skilled engineers .  
Ricebowls must be compact , easy to hold attractive , and not burn the hands that hold them . Ricebowls that meet these basic needs sell well ; those that do n't stay on the store shelf . Put simply , industrial design aims to make products more attractive and easy to use , requiring a minimum of human effort .  
The fundamental elements of western civilization , from columnar architecture , the aesthetic proportions of the human form and humanistic drama to geometric theorems , democracy and the theory of absolutism , all had their origin in the art and culture of ancient Greece .  
He did n't have enough cash on him so he asked to have one held and to pay for it after he finished his show and got his money . " No wonder they are fascinated . Each bonsai is a miniature world all its own , rich in human interest , that can set the spirit soaring to a place where , poised between the real and the imaginary , we wander among the hills and valleys of our dreams . (  
Adding color to some pebbles in a garden a clever landscaper creates a happy smile . An abandoned caboose reveals the markings of time . And three holes arbitrarily arranged on wooden disks compose a medley of human expressions .  
The participants were organized into panels to discuss the following eight topics : tactics for long-term economic development , the development of education and human resources , social and cultural development , the development of science and technology , the development of capital and currency markets , regional development , planning for a comprehensive transportation system , and information and communications .  
Encouraged and influenced by Hsu Ts'ang-tse and Huang Chi-ying and absorbing what he could from Japanese photography magazines , Lin gradually learned the true real meaning of " realistic photography " - - capturing an instant of genuine human feeling while paying attention to every aspect of reality .  
In these photographs Huang 's purpose is to record in brilliant color the special character of the cultures in the fast-changing remote areas on the island . By employing , as he says , " the human touch , " he is able to capture the naturalness , warmth , and ingenuousness of his subjects . In shooting them , he adheres to a traditional , classical style of realistic photography .  
The result has been a change from unitary to pluralistic values , from closed ways of thinking to open ones , from moral and ethical considerations as a prime determinant of human relations to utilitarian and materialistic interests , from a simple and impoverished way of life to more prosperous and complex lifestyles .  
The novelist Eileen Chang has described it as " blue skies and green grass . . . clean as though washed in water . " But having lived in Hong Kong and loving China she has also called it " lacking human warmth . " Now , though , people from Hong Kong are stumbling over themselves in the rush to get there .  
Earlier this century people became aware that if things continued in this way they could end up having a hard time even breathing . They came up with the idea of making polluters pay for the cost of the pollution they were responsible for . With that idea , a struggle over environmental rights , like the earlier one over human rights , became inevitable .  
The Buddhist images , relics , bells , drums , wooden fish , and banners used in temples , which are considered objects of superstition by ignorant people , are actually the tools used to polish and clean the human mind . If the human mind is inherently pure and bright , why is there a need for Buddha images much less wooden fish ?  
Then the quality of daily human existence for everyone will improve immeasurably as we march towards the turn of the century . . Establishing a Science CityAll our cities of today will eventually be transformed into science cities . Our economic infrastructure is based on the development of industrial science and technology . This goes hand-in-glove with the modernization of public facilities .  
Science and the fruits of science will be harmoniously integrated with human life . The modernity and completeness of its public facilities will actively promote a well-rounded existence which is pluralistic in both inspiration and application . The result will not only enhance our international image , but it will also turn us into a model of what modern living should be like . .  
These channels include the arterio-vascular system , the lymphatic system and the nervous system familiar to modern medicine , but at the same time neither is it entirely equivalent to these systems . It is a type of insight into the workings of the human body that transcends modern anatomical knowledge , a kind of sublime wisdom of the ancients .  
The lake , which covered 13 acres , was dug out completely by human labor , one stroke at a time . Besides the five pavilions , the lake was surrounded by carved stones and Canadian pines , whose dense needles , twisted roots and gnarled branches were reflected in the tranquil surface of the lake .  
Naturally it would be panic-mongering to suggest that all of these are dangerous to humans , because many of them have an insignificant impact on the human body . For some it is simply a matter of keeping the volume below a certain " permissible amount . " Thus most advanced countries have stipulated methods of controlling chemical products , estimating their danger , the paths by which they are released , and the proper dosages , and setting the scope for their use and permissible amounts within a safe range .  
But one can discover from many popular stories that the Jade Emperor is buy no means beyond anger and fury , completely impersonal and objective , or able to see all the fine points clearly . On the contrary , He is quite " human , " and often becomes angry so that the common people suffer through no fault of their own , or listens to rumors and half-truths .  
Even more interesting is that the Jade Emperor lived long inside the celestial palace , and became rather detached from the conditions of men . Thus every year on the 24th day of the twelfth month on the lunar calender , all the deities who had been sent among men had to return to the court , and report on the beneficence and evil of each human ; they could only return among the people on the fourth day of the first month in the next year .  
In particular , with population increasingly packed into urban areas , this creates new opportunities for communicable diseases to spread . " 2,000 Dead from Influenza : Looking back at the history of epidemic illnesses , in the era when medicines were still undeveloped and public hygiene was poor , all kinds of diseases spread by bacteria or virus posed an enormous threat to human life .  
Insufficient financial and human resources are the reason why handicapped athletics has never been popularized in this country , " says Ho Mao-sung . The CPAA was established seven years ago , but it only has made annual expenditures of NT $ 100,000 ( NT $ 200,000 this year ) , and the amount its volunteer director , secretary-general , and assistant secretary-general are able to accomplish is limited .  
A Young Forty : It 's a natural human instinct to love singing . Although some criticize Taiwan 's KTV culture as being vulgar , and there are even more people who loudly complain that you have to go to supplementary school even for karaoke , for the vast majority of those who love to sing , whatever the cost in time and money , it 's worth it for that moment of joy of singing a song well , and soaking up the sounds of applause .  
Just ten years ago research into computer " artificial intelligence " was being abandoned as computer researchers around the world were stymied in getting computers to understand models of human thought . Now Chu , who holds boundless enthusiasm for Chinese-language computers , has declared that he has designed " an intelligent Chinese computer " that " can think , learn skills and communicate directly with people using language . " The first stages of its development have already been completed successfully , and it is expected to be formally unveiled within two years . "  
Teeming with life , the river also had a remarkably active course - - which has changed from being bounded by steep U-shaped canyons to having a wide and shallow river bed . Ordinarily this process occurs over the course of thousands of years and can not be observed in a human lifetime .  
This is especially the case in the main area of human settlement east of the Central Mountain Range , the Hua-Tung ( Hualien-Taitung ) Valley , which is a mere three to seven kilometers wide . Taking the Sanmin area for example , within 8.4 kilometers to the west , the land rises from 500 meters above sea level to 3,300 meters , or an average of a rise of one meter for every three meters west that you go .  
Apart from the ups and downs of the political economic situation , Schmidt especially stressed the pessimistic outlook for the environment , raising the problem of population growth and limited resources adding to the worsening of the greenhouse effect and leading to unlimited tides of human migration . "  
Long ago , the busy striving for thoroughness in business and the hectic pace of life led Chen to turn to Confucian principles as an extremely human and practical set of cultural beliefs . He feels sorry that he can not get other modern people to accept them as well .  
At a time of limitless expectations about a prosperous future , we have no way to avoid the heavy costs of technology : environmental pollution , the rapid depletion of natural resources , and even human vulgarity .  
To encourage people to participate and understand that bats are nothing to be afraid of , they set up bat-appreciation spots . These are places where people can go near the mouth of a cave in the evening and see one of nature 's most spectacular and lively sights - - bats leaving the roost . The societies also teach people how to build bat feeders to attract suburban bats and allow them to happily live in a human environment .  
The angry answer comes back that it is society 's search for simplistic explanations that is the problem and that , at his age , the youth is just discovering what a cold , shallow , arrogant culture he lives in - - where the worth of human beings is rated on the basis of the square footage of their homes , their net incomes and exam results , rather than on love and dignity .  
Motorcyclists inhaling carcinogens behind buses , children breathing in particulates that cause respiratory and skin ailments , drivers growing drowsy from carbon monoxide . . . the damage to human health is a huge invisible social cost .  
China 's ancient books have been through human and natural disasters with countless numbers having been destroyed and lost . There are no certain statistics concerning just how many still survive in the world today . Moreover , with there being much space for dispute over how antique works should be carefully determined and compared , it is even more difficult to put numbers on them .  
It is just that if you look at metals such as gold and iron , the former is extremely rare and inert and can not easily undergo chemical changes through combining with other materials , while the latter is used in huge quantities but is actually needed by the human body - - medics even recommend that we use iron cooking pots so as to provide us with supplementary iron .  
When reading Ionesco or Wu we might rejoice that it is not the human race that is endangered , or feel happy that the inhumane phenomenon of forced prison labor is confined to remote China ; we should not forget that the loss of any species to this world , or any trampling on humanity is a serious threat and warning towards anyone who enjoys their human rights and art . (  
And the growing process is far more dangerous and challenging than for a human , between shortages of food , intense competition , learning to fly and hunt , and having to find a nesting place ( so as not to overlap with one 's own parents ) . And nature is unforgiving . Though adults may exhaust themselves trying to feed the chicks , it often happens that not one is alive by the time it comes to leaving the nest .  
" The lonely eagle : " An eagle is circling / The wind along the high ridge inspiring its wings / Those days just before you left / You seemed evasive , restless / So like a gaunt eagle anxious to fly / . . . " - Chen Yi-chih . Accompanying human history over thousands of years , the birds of prey have never been tamed . Their genes know no code for " obedience " or " companionship . "  
This is why many people take the view that just at the basic spirit behind the children 's welfare law is that children have self-esteem and need to be respected by adults , wild animals involved in the workings of human society also need people to fight for their most basic right " not to be subjected to mental terror or physical abuse , " in the same way that disadvantaged groups in society are protected .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
Thus fate in Buddhism refers to action resulting from outer circumstances and to acting in accordance with one 's situation . People have to exist in the world of an unceasing cycle of creation and destruction , and it is only if one understands how to " go with life 's flow , " to face the illusory nature of human life , to be at peace with whatever fortune brings , and neither to hold tight nor cast away , that one can be contented in this inconstant world .  
It 's the place which bore and suckled us . . . we are bound to her not only by understanding , but also by life and emotion . . . no matter how her lofty mountains and sparkling waters may be despoiled , her deep human intimacy diluted , as long as we live on this island of Taiwan , she will always be home to our spirits , " Su Wen-kui , editor of the periodical Hu Wei Chieh wrote in an article .  
In another article , Huang Jui-mao has observed : " A city is an artificial environment created by human beings over time , imbued with collective emotions accumulated over long periods of the human struggle for existence , and expressed in a real spatial environment through the concerns and practical operation of a specific culture .  
When Lin Chung-cheng , an Academia Sinica researcher in social sciences , examined the early economic differences between native Taiwanese and mainlanders , he discovered that native businesses tended to take root among the general public and situate themselves in downstream manufacturing , while mainlander businesses were mostly developing upstream supply industries which could avoid the market weakness of insufficient human resources .  
Dr . Chen felt that apart from doctoring from morning till night , he should have the ability to do something else , so he decided to practice the flute with its complex fingering , for " it helps develop one 's mental capacity . " Dr . Chen says humorously that human beings have around 50 billion brain cells , but most people only use a fifth or a quarter of them throughout their lives ; the rest are left completely unused , which is a real pity .  
" For a country to be strong , it relies not on powerful weapons , but on high quality people , " says Lin Wan-yi . Tp raise the quality of human capital , besides education and technology , raising the level of culture and guaranteeing social security are very important .  
Taiwan 's history is not all centered on the Western plains . The aboriginal peoples have been living here for thousands of years . " He says that human activity in Taiwan has a vertical distribution from ancient to modern times and from high to low . Even the highest mountains show traces of human presence .  
The main motive why Master Hsiao Yun , who has worked as a university professor in the past , decided to found a university was to develop students " who will truly be able to use technology to improve the human condition . " Master Cheng Yan set up the Tzu Chi nursing and medical schools to upgrade medical resources in eastern Taiwan , and to cultivate " beneficent doctors " with a spirit of compassion in an effort to help solve the problem of young girls in eastern Taiwan who have neither education nor employment .  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
She believes that MSG 's principal ingredient , glutamic acid , is not irreplaceable . " The human body can automatically produce this compound or naturally absorb it from fruits and vegetables . That is sufficient , " she says . It is more intelligent to keep MSG , like table salt , at arm 's length . "  
Under the azure sky of a summer day , in the muddy footpaths between the pea fields , there are little groups of human figures , wearing conical farmer 's hats and dressed in colorful patterned shirts , busily moving their hands up and down . Walk in for a closer look , and you see that all of them are women of at least 50 or 60 years old with weathered and wrinkled faces ; there are only a few men scattered here and there among them .  
Right now the mainland economy is heated up , and the financial market has the jitters . Of course private companies ca n't compete with state-owned enterprises which have access to deep and extensive human relations networks , " Yang Donghong observes . If a state-owned establishment defaults on a loan , the loan officer holds little responsibility . But if a private business goes insolvent , the officer who sponsored the loan will almost certainly be unable to escape blame .  
There can be few among the travellers hurrying north or south along the section of the freeway between Tai-an and Sanyi who are not struck by the sudden appearance of this desolate , barren scenery where plain meets plateau , as they pass by the Taan River and Huoyan Mountains . As far as the eye can see , there is no sign of human activity , apart from the matchbox-like gravel trucks on the river embankments .  
For instance , some factories only carve all kinds of Bodhidarma figures , while others specialize in human figures , or birds and animals , and so on . " Collective creation on a production line " is also a widespread method . To take a religious statue as an example , after the rough wooden blank has been cut out , the carving of its face , hands , curves and background , the application of gold leaf and other operations are all the responsibility of different specialists .  
Kang Mu-hsiang , who applies sculptural concepts in his carving , attracts customers to his studio with a large picture of himself holding a chisel and a gouge . Tseng Chin-tsai 's sign uses the theme of a swineherd in the old agricultural society and the song " When Will You Return ? " to allude to the inevitability of suffering in human life . Here one can also find pottery studios , a studio producing mainly carvings of horses , and so on . All the color of Sanyi is concentrated in this one short street .  
Part of her " Series on Man " was the award-winning work " The Ladder , " in which half-abstract human figures were folded and shaped on a ceramic plate , trampling and pushing each other , struggling to climb up a rotten old ladder . If the clay people were careless , they fell off and were smashed to bits .  
Professor B . J . Habibie , Indonesia 's State Minister for Research and Technology , has said publicly : " At some stage Singapore , with its limited natural and human resources but rapid economic growth , is certain to reach a critical pressure , just like a balloon ; and Batam , 20km south of Singapore , is ready to catch the balloon which will be squeezed out of Singapore 's balloon . "  
The explanation is very simple : the ancients gathered their knowledge completely from nature ; they inferred a direct relation between the waxing and waning of the natural world and the birth and death of every human being . When would the fish swim up to the water 's surface through the broken ice ? When would the swallows arrive ? When would the crops bloom and wither ?  
Just as Sun Ta-chuan , secretary-general of the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples ' Cultural Association has said , many Han Chinese have begun to realize that the everyday wisdom inherent in aboriginal culture includes important human factors which have long been lost from their own lives . Such " two-way " thinking is gradually growing into a sound and mutually adaptive interethni relationship .  
On March 26 , 1988 , more than 200 brook masu salmon fry , each of them tagged for identification , prepared to leave the propagation center built for them by human beings and set out to return " home " - - to the Chichiawan Stream at Lishan in central Taiwan .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
With regard to this , some scholars early on suggested that medical histories , being a precious medical resource and crucial to human life , should be transferred along with the person , and should not be locked within the hospital . Ideal as this suggestion may sound , medical centers maintain the hesitant mentality of " if personal medical history is really opened up , wo n't there be endless medical controversies ? "  
At the side of a cliff , a group of bright red sea fans shake with the current , and a school of light green , light purple , and light red anthids float by . Menacing lionfish , covered with what seem to be thorns and claws , swim along face down . Upon seeing human divers - - what strange creatures ! - - sea snakes swim by and touch their flippers . . . .  
The decoration was no longer set off in panels , but composed in continuous scenes on the body of the pieces , and included landscapes with buildings and human characters , and narrative scenes from novels and plays . The designs stressed their Chineseness , and were tailored to the tastes of European consumers .  
The broad realm of poetryAlthough poetry once again aimed to reach out to people and its language was no longer dark and obscure , it was still less accessible than novels or essays . Chang Shiang-hua states , " Its language is concise and to the point , rich in images . It expresses very well the sense of transience of the phenomena of human life . " At the same time , because schools offered no classes in appreciation of modern poetry , the general public still needed some guidance before it could really accept this work .  
In response to the human culture and natural environment of the Lanyang Plain , Wang Chen-hua incorporated many features often seen in old Ilan houses into the Chung home , such as turtle-shell pattern windows , and openings in walls in the shape of peaches and pomegranates , which symbolize good fortune . To cope with the local climate of fierce sunshine and abundant rainfall , the roofs have very broad eaves . In the central courtyard one can watch the rain and listen to its melody .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
One day she made the mistake of entering the realm of an evil wizard who cast a spell and turned her and her maids into swans . Day after day she led her flock of maid swans in sad wandering through the forest . Only in the deep dark night before dawn did they return to their human forms , and the only way to break the spell was to have a young man show undying love for the princess .  
With many of Taiwan 's wild animals having become " disadvantaged groups " or having even been driven to the verge of extinction by pressure from human development , it became a matter of necessity to pass the Wildlife Conservation Law to protect endemic and rare species . But at the same time , previously unknown species of tree frogs , shrews , bats , spiders and many other animals which , though unfamiliar , enrich the list of Taiwan 's endemic species , have recently been " discovered " in the wild .  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
But Taiwan is a major trading area , and includes the world 's third busiest port ( Kaohsiung ) . Ships come and go 24 hours a day , and there are countless business travelers and tourists . Meanwhile dealers are constantly coming up with new ways to smuggle contraband - - tucked into ship containers , hidden away in luggage , even inserted or swallowed into the human body .  
During the years of the preposterous and unprecedented Cultural Revolution , I finally realized that the difference between Mao Zedong and Karl Marx was that Mao extended the scope of the powerful machinery of the dictatorship of the proletariat from the political and economic sphere into the domain of the human mind .  
When the banner of tyranny over the mind was raised high , all the books containing petals of human warmth were banned , and all the poems acknowledged the world over as the height of truth , goodness and beauty were regarded as poisonous weeds of the feudal and bourgeois classes .  
I just ignorantly followed the tide and shouted the slogans of class struggle . Hence when I was made to bow my head , I could still open my eyes to read this preposterous , realistic book and gain a deep understanding of a wrongful era , and see how it turned the noble human race into a pack of dogs with their heads drawn in and their tails tightly between their legs , pitiful housepets who feared a beating every minute .  
The clock tower 's main structure comprised three levels . The upper level bore an armillary sphere , used for astronomical observations ; on the middle level was a celestial globe , which displayed the movements of celestial bodies ; while on the bottom level were wooden mannikins which struck the time of day . The whole formed " a single mechanism , turned by the power of water , without human effort . "  
But the nearby culture of Qi has gradually been all but forgotten by history . Lu civilization was based on agriculture . Agricultural civilization tends toward the soft , the delicate , the conservative . It stresses ethics , human sentiment , stability , the golden mean and morality .  
Winston Peters ' polemics about Asians have been reported to human rights organizations , and the Race Relations Office has not only expressed " concern , " but even published a full-page advertisement picturing four brains , of which three , of equal size , were labelled " Pakeha , " " Maori " and " Asian , " while the fourth , much smaller brain was labelled " Racist . "  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
She continued to explain that the six holes in the shoes that monks and nuns wear represent planting one 's feet on solid ground , and seeing through the vanity of human desires . Their clothing varies according to region . For convenience , some wear long frocks ; others wear robes that leave the right shoulder bare , demonstrating sincerity . There are also special rules for getting dressed : Keep your whole body erect and look straight ahead ; only your hands can move .  
The electricity runs through the circuits like the transmitting material in the human nervous system , which allows the brain to remember , select , calculate , and even listen , speak , read , and write , undertaking all kinds of " intelligent " tasks . The applications of the flow of electric current in a circuit are virtually limitless :  
One of the more extreme examples often cited is that of the nearby Philippines , where university education is very common . Nevertheless , even the Filipina maids who come to work in Taiwan have university diplomas , thus wasting the talented manpower of that nation . How should the quality of human labor be synchronized with economic development ?  
Our ancient ancestors knew only too well how active and vital love can be at its most primitive , so it is hardly surprising if they regarded it as a raging flood or wild beast , and tried to " preserve Heaven 's order by eliminating human desire . "  
Are n't the ' gifted scholars and fine ladies ' of the book simply versions of today 's young ' dudes and babes ? ' " The Chinese notion of predestiny in human relations originated because there was only limited opportunity for meeting partners in olden times , but waiting for a predestined match these days-waiting passively for someone to catch you-is unhealthy and ' fatalistic ! '  
The female prosecutors tend to be a bit more cautious in these matters , paying careful attention to legal and procedural demands . Although this is only proper in respecting human rights , still the police often feel frustrated as a result .  
Many people were taken by their parents deep into the mountains to be tattooed in secret . The preconditions for having tattoos were gradually relaxed . Males no longer had to have hunted a human head , and females no longer had to be able to weave . The age at which facial tattooing occurred was also moved forward ; many children and adolescents had facial tattoos early , according to their parents ' wishes .  
Aside from the direct economic loss to the human race of the trees as a source of timber , many people believe that if large numbers of Taiwan red pine exit Taiwan 's biological stage , it would be overoptimistic to think that in many areas of rugged terrain where native pines now grow , the original vegetation could be restored by voluntary tree planting campaigns .  
Far from his native place , Su looked back on his frustrated career and felt he had spent 30 years in a dream of illusory glory . On awakening he now found himself mired in the mud of human politics , his future uncertain . He felt like a fish caught on a hook , unable to swim up or down .  
Compared with the lonely pines standing among great mountains and ageless rivers , the material aspirations of the human world are transitory and fleeting . As life and history pass , even the greatest sorrows will be wiped away . When we humans see how nature is unconcerned at our troubles , our own mood in the face of adversity or disaster may be calmed : what is owned may be lost , and the present may pass-one need only seek compensation in one 's own soul .  
A stone altar is decorated with the figure of a priest , sitting cross-legged and wearing an ornate headdress ; his head stands out in sharp relief . But what is the most astonishing of all is surely the several colossal human heads carved out of granite , each of them around two meters high and weighing up to twenty tons .  
This exhibit , known as Offering No . 4 , was found at La Venta in 1955 , and comprises 15 human figures about six inches tall , carved from jade or serpentine , and arranged in a half-circle facing a figure carved from red sandstone . Behind the red figure are six jade " celts " ( polished , chisel-shaped implements ) , on which incised symbols or writing are faintly discernible .  
Ann Philips , a retired professor from the Spanish department at the University of Central Oklahoma , cited the example of how the Maya script was deciphered : for many years researchers could only puzzle over those exquisite human figures and other images , but could not interpret them ; in the end it was an " amateur " - the painter Linda Schele-who interpreted the script from the content of the images themselves , and thus solved many mysteries about the history of Mayan dynastic succession .  
In the end , Lin has selected and weighed the most absolutely central , canonical materials from history , taking into consideration every kind of musical genre and aspect of living concern , as in the typical emotions in human social life , praise of nature , the careful observation of transformations in space and time , various interesting features of everyday living , the fundamental pulse of life , and so forth , and in this way has gradually expanded the collection to 67 musical pieces .  
Liao , an assistant professor of literary history at National Chung Cheng University , thinks that some of the Chinese literati were softer , warmer , and more sensitive . These writers admired the naturalness and purity of children , and so often used children to give allegorical expression to these feelings , contrasting these traits with the ambiguous nature of human affairs . They allowed themselves to take comfort in the naivet * and guilelessness of children .  
Although its strivings have produced no small number of impressive works , many of the generation 's artists have yet to come completely into their prime-particularly in regard to manifesting the " full human potential " sought by traditional literati ink painting . Many of the most famous painters were 80 to 90 years old before attaining a level of maturity that allowed them to express their deepest sentiments in their work at will .  
While evaluating plans for ROCSAT-2 , the group decided that because synchronous satellites are vastly more complex than low-orbit satellites , and because it would be difficult to redirect the technical and human resources which were being built up through the ROCSAT-1 project , ROCSAT-2 would be redesignated as a low-orbit satellite .  
When the floodgates were later opened , the floodwater receded within half-an-hour , leaving behind a thick layer of mud and incalculable damage . Afterwards , as Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian was on vacation overseas , Deputy Mayor Lin Chia-cheng made a statement which asserted that human error had been involved in the Tahu flood . Bureau of Public Works Director Hsu Jui-feng has agreed to take the blame for this incident , and Office of City Parks &amp; Street Lights Director Chang Ching , as well as five of his subordinates , have received demerits .  
It 's just that state firms often are less efficient than private ones because they have three burdens to bear : implementing state policies based on non-economic concerns , accepting legal restraints and interference from government agencies , and the human failing of usually performing public tasks more poorly than those involving private profit . Thus people often are dismayed with state firms .  
With IVF , the surrogate mother need not have any direct physical contact with the prospective father . Yet although this might appear more in keeping with " human dignity " and " moral values , " it is precisely this artificial approach of " only wanting a child and not wanting sex , " which many people find suspect about the whole procedure .  
Whether or not legislation is passed , perhaps in the end it will still be a matter for individual choice and conscience , and the new issues created by modern technological " solutions " by which humans seek to " overcome nature , " such as human cloning , cryogenics and so on , will continue to constantly force mankind to search for still more comprehensive and precisely formulated social rules , and will forever push " evolution " to new heights .  
Huang feels that stories designed to make a moral point are oversimplified , and real life is much more complicated . What he likes is to capture human nature , as in the Chinese opera classic The Fourth Son Visiting His Mother , which retains its emotional impact today because the son is torn between family and country , wife and mother .  
Fa Chih-pin , a professor of law at Chengchih University , points out that early on most countries included slander and libel in criminal law . After World War II , with strengthened calls from international organizations to protect human rights , the problems of finding people guilty for slander and libel under criminal law gradually began to become apparent . " The major difference between criminal and civil law is that people can be locked up under criminal law , and when people are in jail they clearly do n't have freedom to speak and publish . "  
Chen Shu says that as an agent , of course he wants to make sure all the paperwork proceeds smoothly , and yet the required paperwork for fishing vessels to enter and exit the harbor is very complicated . Argentina is very strict on safety , as strict as any developed country . It requires stringent guards against environmental pollution-oil can not be poured directly into the sea , and there must be oil and water filtering mechanisms , chemical treatment of human waste , foot activation devices for washing hands , and so on .  
He also cites the example of the German software company SAP , which has risen to prominence in recent years . He explains that the company has tapped into the demand created by businesses ' need to restructure , by designing integrated software for human resource management , financial management , accounting and materials management . SAP has become the global leader in software for " enterprise resource planning , " with an annual turnover of US $ 4 billion .  
" The purpose of technology is to serve human cultural development , and the world has already reached a stage in which intangible assets are the most valued and the most valuable , " said Acer Group chairman and CEO Stan Shih at a press conference , adding that the main reason why software is so expensive in Taiwan is because of the small size of the local market .  
Of course , there is much in these " new age " books that looks ridiculous , that is mere wishful thinking , or that is just opinion . But they make apparent the great desire of human beings to seek truth , goodness , and knowledge . People have always been dissatisfied with , dubious about , or willing to challenge actual experience , and have sought a better world .  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
In particular , Daoists ' choice of places to identify as fairy grottoes , apart from being suitable places to refine elixirs in the hope of transcending death , also responded to the mood of the times and to practical needs . Hence rich , fertile soil suitable for growing rice , and locations out of reach of natural disasters and human wars and turmoil , became essential requirements for the blessed abodes .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
The most novel interpretation of the tales of love between immortals and regular human beings appears in a book published in Taiwan , in which the author argues that the denizens of heaven are sapped of their sex drive by perpetually fair weather , beautiful clothing , delectable food , and centuries of living at a metabolic rate of zero .  
" Having aboriginal people , who have always been the subjects of anthropological study , operating the camera themselves is a revolution in the history of documentary film making , " exclaims Wang . It is of course a separate issue whether or not documentaries based on their own subjective points of view will be " better , " but from a human rights point of view , granting the subjects of research the right to speak for themselves is definitely to be encouraged .  
He met the subject of the piece , Li Jung-lin , nine years previously when Li handled the funeral of his mother . But it was only two years ago , when Lin 's mother 's grave was robbed , and Li , wearing a gas mask , personally went into the grave to repair the damage to the coffin , that Lin really came to understand this man . He discovered that Li has quite remarkable views on death , human dignity , and on the poor self-regulation of the funeral industry .  
In an attempt to rein in this flaw in human character , some legislators and members of medical associations who recognized the potential problem proposed measures to seal loopholes in the system . The measures proposed included one under which NHI would only have paid for hospital stays , not minor illnesses , and another which would have required patients to pay the cost differential created when they go to a major hospital to treat a minor problem . However , neither of these proposals were accepted .  
Although investigation of the relationship between climate and infectious diseases is still at a preliminary stage , excessive human development of jungles and rainforests has increased people 's chances of coming into contact with the microorganisms which live there , and with their natural hosts .  
Chen Hao-yung of the NIPM says that once a virus develops into an urban virus it becomes very hard to eradicate . Viruses are very simple in structure , and as long as they have live cells to act as their hosts they can continue to reproduce . Hence cities , which have dense human populations and also harbor large numbers of rodents and other pests , are perfect breeding grounds for viruses .  
" We ca n't know if this was right or not , " admits Wu Tsung-neng . No one knows if the slowing of the epidemic was due to human effort or was a natural trend . However , from the fact that over the same time period other communicable diseases also were reduced , it can be assumed that the preventive measures taken against the enterovirus were effective .  
But with something as marvelously complex as the human body , there are always eventualities that can not be predicted in a living will . For instance , when a patient falls into a deep coma as a result of a stroke , the brain stem that controls cardiopulmonary functions may become completely unresponsive ( resulting in brain death ) . In such circumstances , a patient could die in a few minutes or might survive for two weeks , but death is assured .  
Not only in the realm of medical care , but also in the laboratory and in clinical research , researchers are investigating traditional medicines in the hope of striking gold . Their ambition is to find more effective ways to deal with the many hard-to-treat illnesses which currently afflict human beings . The more optimistic among them predict that integration of TCM and Western medicine will become part of the mainstream of medical care in the 21st century .  
In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Research has revealed that human metabolic processes produce something known as a " free radical . " These free radicals cause a kind of oxidation which damages normal cells and weakens the body 's immune response . This can lead to illness , aging and even death . Free radicals have also been implicated as a possible cause of cancer .  
" People 's lives were wasted when they were imprisoned for many years here because of their beliefs and political views , " said Premier Vincent Siew , who spoke as master of ceremonies at the monument 's ground-breaking . " In truth , freedom of belief is a God-given right , and no one should be imprisoned for political reasons . " Past history shows us , Siew noted , that human wisdom is often distorted by mistaken judgment , with deep regrets later .  
" In traditional Chinese thinking there were human rights , there just was n't the term for them , " says Chai Sung-lin , chairman of the Chinese Human Rights Association . Apart from the support for human rights expressed in pre-Qin thought , when Liu Bang ruled at the end of the Qin , he and the elders mandated in law that those who killed would die themselves , and those who injured and robbed would be punished . " This provided a legal basis for protecting people 's rights to life and property . "  
In A Comparison of Chinese and Western Conceptions of Human Rights , the legal scholar Chang Yi-ting holds that Chinese society uses the power of ethics and morality to create a harmonious society . This is an exalted ideal of Confucianism and is also a major reason why there is no record of Chinese in ancient times fighting for human rights .  
For being and nonbeing give rise to each other , difficulty and ease complete each other , long and short reveal each other . . . . " This too displays Laozi 's characteristic way of thinking : everything in the manifest world comes in relative and complementary pairs , and human value judgements are mostly born of relativity .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets . But in fact , when the interests of pets or of animals raised as food or for medical research conflict with those of humans , people often fail to consider their physical and mental well-being .  
There is no parallel in human history for the bronze-making culture that flourished in China over 3,000 years ago . Particularly noteworthy are the bronzes that have been unearthed at Anyang in the Yellow River basin . The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
And taiji means " the natural way " - standing erect and centered , being impartial and unbiased , neither lacking nor in excess , adhering to one position-in other words the way of the natural world , and the way of the human being . Or in short : moral cultivation , the very purpose of human life .  
The importance of the human factor can not be overlooked . No matter how sophisticated forensic techniques are , and no matter how advanced scientific instruments may become , the key to success will always be how well the practitioner makes use of his tools . The core elements of scientific criminal investigation are broad knowledge , finely honed powers of observation , and a combination of bold imagination and cautious search for proof .  
ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry . It is a constant motivating force for democratic political development . In the future , the ROC will continue to practically implement and fully realize such essential components of civilization as democracy , freedom and human rights , striving in concert with others to achieve the goal of global press freedom .  
" If it had n't been for the Formosa Plastics mercury waste incident in Cambodia , who knows how long the chaos in Taiwan 's management , storage and disposal of hazardous industrial wastes would have continued , along with the tremendous threat it poses to human health and the environment ? " asks Professor Lin Cheng-fang of National Taiwan University 's Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering , giving FPG some backhanded credit for highlighting the issue .  
As " artistic supervisor of character design , " Chang set about crafting the overall style of Mulan , and he discovered an element from classical Chinese painting that proved useful in animation-the " gossamer sketching " method of delineating human figures . In particular , the curving lines that form the hands of Buddhist deities , giving the effect of floating clouds or flowing water , became the artistic basis for the film 's character design .  
At the tenth anniversary of Tiananmen , preventive measures by the mainland authorities made substantive attacks against the government impossible . But participants in a symposium on " The May Fourth Movement and 20th-Century China " at Peking University in early May could scarcely fail to expand on the stated theme , to touch on the currently most sensitive topics of democracy , human rights and freedom which were the issues behind Tiananmen . Hence the symposium was full of the sense that " all history is contemporary history . "  
In fact , American China policy has maintained a general direction based on three main national interests : democracy and human rights , economics and trade , and security and military strategy . The periodic swinging results from a tug of war between two groups of US domestic forces , one more accomodating toward Beijing such as the mainstream China scholars , the other more critical , such as the media . Nevertheless , Taipei seeks simultaneous improvement of relations with both Washington and Beijing .  
Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry . But innovation requires huge quantities of financial and human resources dedicated to R &amp; D , with laboratories pursuing technological breakthroughs around the clock , and with professional investment managers able to turn innovative ideas into products and profits . "  
Recently he has introduced the United Nations ' newest perspectives on human rights . Nevertheless , Chai , whose head of white hair reveals his years , admits he feels that society is changing too fast . " Everyone is groping in the dark as we face new situations . We do n't have any kind of life experience that 's worth being proud of , that we can pass on to the next generation . "  
People have long criticized Chinese society for putting more emphasis on human relationships than on written codes . But many people do not know that during the Han dynasty , China had a comprehensive set of laws that was every bit as impressive as the renowned imperial Roman civil code .  
Ko 's own attitude towards the Song dynasty is a mixture of love and hate . Those deeply introspective literary types with their lofty moral standards produced artistic achievements of the highest order . Yet they also seemed " over-civilized , " devoid of any streak of wildness , as if lacking part of what makes us human .  
Assistance also comes from locals who have long been active in the labor and human rights movements , such as Yvonne Lin , who for nearly ten years has helped foreign laborers stuck in detention centers to get back to their home countries . Lin says that caring for the lives of working people is a cause that transcends nationality , and that disputes between overseas workers and their employers often simply highlight problems already faced by Taiwanese workers . Tackling such problems can help to pave the way for improved rights all round .  
Stroking the silver-gray ringlets which are twice as fine as human hair , Chang says that these soft , flexible fibers of high-grade steel can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but-thanks to metals ' outstanding capacity to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and their ability to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments-they also have a wide range of applications in many industries .  
In the early years of ROC rule in Taiwan , the government sent political prisoners to Green Island . Those inmates lucky enough to survive that era of oppression and return to their normal lives , as well as family members of prisoners and other citizens concerned about human rights , joined together to create the foundation . So that the suffering of that period would not be forgotten , they raised money to establish this memorial , which bears witness to the government 's past mistakes and the pain of those who suffered under its oppression .  
" Building on this foundation , we will continue striving to protect this resource . Human rights are dependent on more than merely political and legal struggle . Rather , they involve independent thinking and respect for people as individuals . We 've got to take our conception of human rights and make it an integral part of people 's basic moral fiber , so that it is fully manifested in everyday life . "  
At the end of every year it issues its " indices of human rights in Taiwan . " The association 's Chai Song-lin says that this year Taiwan earned failing marks in all eight categories of human rights : political , children 's , elderly , economic , judicial , educational-cultural , social and women 's rights .  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit . Lien 's " third wave of reform " has six major objectives , including achievement of " clean and competent government , " " a justice system dedicated to true justice , " " a greater role for the national legislature and an overhaul of the National Assembly , " and " the preservation of basic human rights . "  
As such , he proposes that both Taiwan and the mainland issue a yearly white paper on human rights to review fishing disputes , cross-strait marriage and residency , and other human rights issues generated by contact between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait . The ultimate objective in so doing would be to build up mutual trust by encouraging real interaction at the personal level .  
West Lake in Hangzhou is n't famous just for its beauty , but also for the fact that it was there that Xu Xian met his star-crossed lover , the beautiful Bai Niang-niang ( a snake spirit who took a fancy to Xu and changed into human form to marry him ) . Writers have penned moving descriptions of their love story , and no Chinese can visit the lake without thinking of the fabled romance between man and enchantress .  
I have always remembered the encouragement which Mr . Yu Youren gave me as a young reporter . He said that to be a fearless champion of social justice , as is expected of a journalist , the most important thing , apart from energy and vitality , is modesty . You have to treat everybody the same , and not be overawed by the great and powerful . A president or a street sweeper deserve the same respect as a human being , and should both be treated the same way .  
All of these developments will have a huge impact on the future well-being of the human race , yet for many of us they are distant and unfamiliar . This is particularly true of genetic engineering , considered the biggest breakthrough in the life sciences since genetics and molecular biology . Man has begun to probe the very origins of life .  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
It involves eighteen countries , headed by the US , the UK , Japan , Germany , France and mainland China . The project was originally scheduled for completion in 2005 , but intense competition from a privately owned gene-sequencing company , Celera Genomics , spurred the multinational team to bring forward its timetable , and a full , precise map of the human genome is now expected before 2003 .  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
According to Chang Sung-jen , an art critic who acts as Ju Ming 's agent , " Tai ji quan involves a force that is from beyond the realm of ordinary human experience , and art that focuses on this subject could very nearly be categorized as religious art . The people motif , on the other hand , is about the commonplace . " To deal with the subject of tai ji quan takes boldness and vigor , while sculpting people requires great attention to detail and very good technical skill .  
In contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , Annette Lu has emphasized " soft national power . " Before her departure she stated that Taiwan advocates human rights , democracy , high-technology , compassion , and peace . If Taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such " soft power , " one day the United Nations will turn around and want Taiwan to join .  
Chen Ai-ni , an expert on gender and marriage , says that emphasizing human rights in marriage is not meant to put one 's spouse " on warning " or to make divorce more fair . Rather it is to preserve marriage and secure the foundations of happiness between husband and wife . Chen believes that it can effectively deter physical and psychological domestic violence , which would be the first step in " happiness engineering . "  
Quoting Bo Yang , Chen said , " For all the mistakes and abuses committed in the past , we can be understanding , tolerant and forgiving , but we can never forget-because those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it . " In response to human rights problems , Chen said that every nation must work to raise awareness and education , uphold international standards , and create legal mechanisms for promoting and protecting human rights .  
The case has elicited the concern of human rights groups around the world . The London headquarters of Amnesty International , which describes the convictions as " the judicial ruling of an uncivilized nation , " has organized several support campaigns for the three men , and last May sent representatives to Taiwan , where they called a press conference and stated , " If Taiwan 's government intends to make human rights a trump card of its foreign policy , it should first grant clemency to the Hsichih trio . "  
This independent film festival , which aimed to present the Amis ' own world view , brought together 14 films by four Amis directors and one Japanese director . The organizers attempted to cast off impressions of the aboriginal peoples based on a mishmash of cultural cliches , and also hoped that the festival and its accompanying seminars , concert and gourmet buffet would help city people understand the true " Pangcah . " " Pangcah " is the Amis word for " human being , " and also the term by which the Amis refer to themselves .  
" It is estimated that the pool of human knowledge doubled once every fifty years in the 19th century , and about once every ten years in the 20th century . Now it doubles once every three to five years , " notes Wu Se-hwa , dean of the business school at National Chengchi University . The explosive growth of information is the most distinctive feature of the 20th century , and has brought sweeping changes to the world 's political , social , and economic structure .  
For most of history , the limited powers of our unaided senses left humans blissfully unaware of the micro-organisms all around us . But the development of optical instruments gradually lifted the veil from that hidden world , so that human ideas about life had to be constantly revised .  
He became aware of how vastly different the Buddhist carvings in the Yungang Grottoes were to ancient Greek sculptures : the East emphasized tranquillity , capturing the essence , whereas the West stressed unrestrained energy and realistic depiction . Western figurative art considered the human body as a geometric form , an approach which culminated in the cubism of Picasso , whereas the Wei and Jin carvings of the Buddha give the human figure a sense of life and their forms embody and evoke a sense of more of life 's elements .  
" Being involved in a social movement taught me that , at their core , most social problems come down to the fundamental character of human beings . So having been part of an organized movement , having worked within a group , I 've gone back to the beginning and am looking at myself . " Even as a child , Chen was introspective and given to challenging anything she perceived as unfair .  
As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
In the reign of emperor Han Wu Di ( 141-87 BC ) , Dong Zhongshu tried to use catastrophes to hold the emperor in check and prevent excessive concentration of political power in his hands . He argued that unusual heavenly events portended major changes in the course of human affairs , and championed the idea that one could predict the future by observing the stars .  
In fact , in any land and age , the human longing for a sense of security is likely to keep popular belief in astrology alive and kicking . But with the extremely high-powered telescopes that are trained on the skies today , heavenly bodies are no longer veiled in secrecy . One question that Chinese astronomers might do well to address is how to resurrect ancient Chinese astronomy and make it into more than just a quaint source of astro-babble among people wondering which zodiac signs make for a romantic match .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
The GalaxyChip design involves cutting up a traditional polymer chip , around one square centimeter in size , into tens of thousands of much smaller chips only 100 microns across-a tenth of the thickness of a human hair . These tiny chips are " as numerous as stars in the sky " - hence the name GalaxyChip .  
Lo Liu-chih points out that the collared bush robins that live on the ground in the forest understory mainly nest on grassy slopes , where as well as being exposed to major airborne predators such as raptors and crows , they are also apt to attract the attention of land animals such as weasels and rock monkeys . " Large creatures like weasels , birds of prey or nutcrackers may be more sensitive to traffic , and more easily frightened by human activity , " says Lo Liu-chih .  
In May 2000 a peaceful transfer of power was accomplished for the first time in Chinese history when the Democratic Progressive Party 's Chen Shui-bian took over as president of the Republic of China . In his inaugural address , he stressed that the country was founded based on respect for human rights . Then in October of that year he formally established an advisory committee on human rights chaired by Vice President Annette Lu .  
Third - and fourth-year elementary school pupils are expected to master some 30 defined skills in social studies , including the abilities to " describe the lifestyles of people in different regions , " " survey the distribution of and changes in the population of their home area , " and " recognize that the formation of a settlement is a response to the human need for communal living . "  
First , while average global temperature is rising , warming occurs at different rates and in differing degrees depending upon location . For example , the large " body " of the ocean is similar to that of an adult human in that it does n't easily become " feverish . " Land , on the other hand , more closely resembles a small child that catches a fever at the mere mention of the word .  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
Two years back Taiwan experienced a major earthquake . Last year there were landslides and massive flooding here , and also the horrific 911 incident in New York . And most recently Taiwan has faced a drought . Some of these are natural disasters , some are man-made , and some are natural disasters made worse by human action .  
In addition , Taiwan 's background as a former Japanese colony and the many Taiwanese who have studied and worked in the US give the island a human network of international dimensions . Add in the fact that the island shares a common language and culture with China and with ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia , and the tight ties between its own business , political and academic circles , and Taiwan looks to be very well positioned here at the beginning of the era of globalization .  
To date , the DCB has acquired four new technologies with medical applications , including a platform to generate human monoclonal antibodies against entrovirus type 71 , and drugs with the potential to treat complications resulting from chronic heart failure and diabetes . The center is also beginning to get its hands on very promising technologies used to modify genes and proteins . It 's who you know  
In the novel , humans have long since created intelligent computers , the Earth is in the complete control of a cosmic computer alliance , all material needs are met , the genetic codes of all organisms have been fully decoded , the human dream of eternal youth has been realized , and humans can acquire all kinds of knowledge at any time through the network communication systems that they carry with them .  
Chu Bong-foo says he first conceived Cosmic Drifter in 1998 . The ideas came from his previously published Nine Essays On Intelligence , in which he discusses thought , human nature and value in terms of energy conversion , the formation of matter , the nature of time and space , and the evolution of the universe . But the essays ' content was dry and dull , and nobody understood it . Therefore he wanted to turn his theories into a popular novel that ordinary people would understand .  
Hsu Tzu-you , who has helped terminal cancer patients employing Chinese and Western folk medicine , has in recent years been a forceful proponent of preventative medicine . He states that the human body is a thing of marvel and mystery , explaining how the sympathetic nerve and the parasympathetic nerve help each other obtain balance . But now that people live very sedentary lives , they are constantly exercising their brains but little else .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
But World Heritage Sites are rightfully the collective inheritance of the human race , regardless of where they happen to be located . If they meet the criteria for World Heritage Sites , then they should be designated as such . As members of the global village , we need to protect these precious assets and pass them on to future generations .  
The false cypress forests which bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing Taiwan 's fragmented earth , also form a safety valve for the Shihmen Reservoir , Tanshui River and Lanyang River on which the people of northern Taiwan depend for their drinking water . The band of cypress forest that runs from Mt . Chilan to Mt . Lala forms a huge natural reservoir that soaks up heavy rainfall and releases it in gentler flows while keeping the soil firmly in its grasp , in a way that no human engineering project could replicate .  
After millions of years of wind and sea erosion , many of the pillars on the basalt islands have been worn down and are now covered with mud . More recently , human activity has made it difficult to distinguish what is so interesting about these basalt islands . Only by approaching cliffs near the edge of the sea or visiting uninhabited peripheral islands can one clearly see the basalt columns with their vertical fractures running from top to bottom .  
In order to protect Penghu 's precious basalt formations , as well as the countless sea birds that pass by here , in 1993 the Council of Agriculture , acting on suggestions from academics , declared a group of islands in the southeast part of Penghu which rarely see human activity to be the Penghu Columnar Basalt Nature Preserve . The basalt islands , like black pearls across the Western Pacific , are glittering assets of the common heritage of mankind .  
Unlike the austere limestone topology surrounding Mayan settlements in Mexico , many of the Mayan remains in Guatemala are buried within lush tropical forests . Mayan culture fused human culture with the natural environment , achieving tremendous prosperity that can be seen today in the remains of colossal pyramids , temples , sport arenas , and in the network of roads that connected them all . These achievements reflect the golden age of Mayan Culture .  
Chung Chiao , head of a drama company and also a judge for the poetry competition , analyzes the poems in terms of content : The Filipino poems subtly reveal the fervent culture of a tropical island colonized by the Spanish , a poetry filled with love of life and more socially conscious , because of the Filipino tradition of fighting for their rights ; Indonesian works tend to emphasize the micro details of human relationships , while the Vietnamese and Thai poems contain more advice and aphorisms .  
Chang Shiang-hua , who played a leading role in the translation of these poems , points out : " No matter how much difference there may be in political , military , or economic values , no matter how much competition or even conflict there maybe , basic human nature can still in many respects be recorded in poetry , and convey the beauty and the purity of heart .  
" It takes miniscule amounts of environmental hormones to cause harm , and there are no obvious side-effects in the short term . More research is still needed to confirm the connection with human reproductive disorders . As a result , people are apt to treat this issue lightly . " Wang Cheng-hsung worries that while guarding against more obvious risks , people will be complacent about these subtler dangers .  
Taumi is located about five kilometers southwest of Puli Township , at the entrance to Sun Moon Lake . It borders University Pond , a 400-hectare body of water where lilies grow in abundance . National Chi Nan University is located here , and the town has the appealing nickname of " doctorate village " among folks in Nantou County . In sum , it enjoys an outstanding geographic position and excellent human and cultural resources .  
Instead she committed herself to the struggle for freedom , human rights and democracy . After the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident , she supported her husband Chen Shui-bian in embarking on a political career ; a decade later , when Chen was arrested , she won election to the legislature . She later helped her husband to victory in the 2000 presidential elections . Wu had shown an abiding commitment to democratic reform , and had earned a special place in the history of Taiwan 's democratization .  
Because the digital economy is the trend , and it affects all elements of national economic growth-investment behavior , productivity , human resources , currency policy , inflation-and these are things that businesses can not control ( or even understand ) , especially in this murky era when the rules of the game are unclear , the role played by the government is critical .  
It seems clear that in the future , once technologies such as streaming media , wireless networking , digital TV and broadband transmission have matured , all human activities will be able to be satisfied in the digital world .  
For the September edition of Sinorama , your magazine interviewed me on issues related to the protection of human rights for people of diverse sexual orientations ( including homosexuals , bisexuals and transgender people ) . Perhaps for reasons of space , many controversial points were not covered in detail , so I am now writing to give a little further explanation and to again call on people of vision to press the relevant authorities to quickly draft laws to concretely protect the basic human rights of transgender people .  
The unseen , untouchable realm of nanotech has already captured the imagination of the world . Whether you 're talking about " cellular automata " that patrol inside a human body to keep blood vessels clean or repair damaged cells , or tiny " mosquito " missiles so small that they are undetectable by radar , both are nanotech marvels .  
The reason is simple : " Because plants do not grow for us to eat them . " The cell structure of most biological materials is very durable , and not easily broken down . Therefore it is difficult for the matter inside to be released , much less absorbed into the human body .  
One of these university freshmen had a camera , and on the summit he suddenly had a flash of inspiration to combine the majesty of nature with a portrait of the liberated human body . He asked his buddy to pose nude , with his head bent and body leaning at an angle . To get the image he desired , the photographer crouched low .  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
Everyone is connected to their family and the caring between two generations is natural . The givers now will one day receive . This kind of filial piety , which is built around basic feelings of human nature , is not exclusive to Chinese society . Yeh Kuang-hui , who is still researching the topic of filial piety , has lots of friends doing research on this subject in the United States and Australia .  
Why is it that the WHO , which emphasizes pursuing human health across all racial , religious , economic , and social boundaries , is unable to bring Taiwan within its international network ?  
It was for these human rights and medical goals that the international community established the WHO . So when over 190 countries around the world fall under the protective umbrella of WHO , yet the 23 million people of Taiwan are excluded , this is not only unfair to Taiwan , it also represents a weakness in the overall global healthcare structure .  
Getting the injured quickly to medical treatment was the only bright spot in an otherwise tragic day . The accident was caused by simple human error , but some point out that the railway is underfunded and disaster could have struck in other ways . Each year there are 800,000 visitors to the Alishan Forest Recreation Area , which is under the auspices of the Taiwan Forestry Bureau , and every holiday the area is packed with visitors .  
Perhaps the SARS outbreak can remind humankind that regardless of ethnic differences , of how powerful a nation may be , and of whether it stands at the center or on the periphery of world affairs , in the face of a tiny virus the divisions and conflicts of the human world are nothing more than a farce . In the face of the disease , ideological and ethnic differences that are often seen as insurmountable , come to appear insignificant .  
These instruments are not only the main characters in Indian music and dance but are also a principal medium for honoring the gods and entertaining people . And the erotic paintings that cause people to blush at the museum are not only expressions of human carnal desires . They are even better illustrations of the many-layered Indian religious philosophy , which holds that gods rose out of the common human world .  
Eight of the ten largest tourist agencies in Japan manage domestic tourism and depend solely on this market . Japan has managed the tourism industry with amazing skill . This is especially true for the hot springs areas popular with the silver-haired generation , where nature is combined with human artifice , places that can truly be described as " products of culture , " like the famous Hakone and Izu hot springs areas .  
Sadly , widespread planting of betelnut trees , tea plants , and mustard plants has destroyed the old appearance of the forest , and the most famous sight along the route up-the " sacred ancient tree " - was knocked down on July 1 , 1997 . The destruction caused by human activity on Mt . Ali is tragic , but fortunately the railway is holding its own , and many tourists are still thrilled by the " screw-thread " and " zig-zag " sections of the line .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
However , Choice 's main task is the construction of book and magazine centers nationwide ; vital logistical centers like those of Hunan Publishing House and the Beijing Institute of Light Industry are entirely built on the work of Choice , from hardware construction to software and human resource management , all on a solid base of Taiwanese know-how .  
Of course , the war was not in the least affected by the protest . But it is gratifying that on this subject at least there was a broad consensus among local feminist organizations , returning to the basic starting points of the women 's movement : love , peace , justice , and human rights . Perhaps it is by returning to basic humane values that the women 's movement in Taiwan will enjoy a resurgence .  
For example , in order to show the expression on a human face , Wu Ching-fang has used as many as a dozen layers of paper , carefully carved out , in order to create lifelike human eyes , eyelashes and wrinkled skin . When facial expressions are especially complex it is also necessary to use folding , sticking , overlapping , inlaying and pressing techniques to achieve the desired effect .  
To put into practice this ideal of caring for the elderly , Shikatsu-once voted Japan 's best town-has allocated close to 1.5% of its annual budget to the museum and library , and an astonishing amount of human and physical resources have been put into them .  
The changing face of the Yushan area at the hands of human beings over the last hundred years is quite clear . Although since the Japanese occupation Yushan has satisfied the so-called spiritual needs and intellectual inquiries of scholars from various disciplines , this has generally been for the one-sided benefit of mankind , done with a specific purpose in mind . And this includes the so-called " spirit of Yushan " today , which is a product of mankind 's subjective emotional projection .  
The fires continue to flicker ; the world continues to evolve ; and explorers continue to explore , walking endlessly into the vast unknown and shedding light on the mysterious corners of human nature , like a light searching out the real self .  
Lu Ming-fong says , " If we combine genetic research with traditional Chinese medicine we will make the road ahead much shorter . " Traditional Chinese medicine divides the human organism into the five different phases , or constitutions , of metal , wood , water , fire , and earth . Genes also show that different people have different constitutions . For example , it appears that people with cardiovascular diseases rarely get cancer , because heart disease is what Chinese medicine calls a " hot " condition , whereas cancer is a " cold " one .  
The rapid advance of genetic research is giving substance to the medical world 's high hopes for the future . As the function and interactions of our 35,000 genes are analyzed and explained , genetic screening will facilitate effective disease prevention and drug treatment at every step of human development , from the embryonic stage to old age . The age of personalized medicine seems sure to arrive , with all the benefits it will bring .  
In September of last year , Dr . Lin , who had for a long time focused her research on blood groups and ethnic groups , published the results of a study entitled " Correlation between SARS virus infection and the human leukocyte antigen . " Lin concluded that there is a direct connection between the presence of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B46 and the severity of a SARS infection . She found that ethnic southern Chinese who  
Li sets her stories in her hometown of Lukang , here appearing as the city of Lu , about which vengeful female spirits have entrenched themselves , one each to the north , south , east , and west , and another in its center . Their implacability has put them outside of the cycle of life and death-unable to be reborn , they tarry in the human world as ghosts . Over the course of time , these ghosts have participated in and even helped to forge the island 's history .  
Since ancient times , people in the East have for the most part believed that the soul does not perish after death . Egyptians developed mummies , and Taoists in China pursued longevity and deathlessness through alchemy . Even the Buddhists , who viewed the human body as a stinking sack of skin , took bodily incorruptibility as a sign of successful cultivation .  
In contemporary society , life and death have moved from being centered around the family to being handled by professionals , from being something human to becoming something mechanized . People have few opportunities to encounter birth or death , and to plumb the mysteries of life . On the one hand , this unfamiliarity with the basic processes of life frequently results in a nameless fear .  
American medical science began to study the human foot after World War II , when a great many American soldiers who had suffered foot injuries required special medical treatment . The manufacture of orthopedic footwear and auxiliary equipment proved to be particularly troublesome for conventional medicine .  
Lu pointed out that around the globe regional organization is a growing trend , and various continents have given rise to such organizations . Besides the European Union , with its comprehensive political and economic structure , the Organization of American States , the Sistema de la Integracion Centroamericana ( SICA ) , the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , and the African Union have been formed one after another . However , it is a regrettable fact that Asia , where human civilization began , has yet to effectively organize itself .  
" The old idea of saving money for retirement is no longer feasible . Currency can lose value and is really not dependable . Right now people should be spending all their effort at saving up human capital , raising their hireability , so that when a person goes out looking for a job he can actually get hired , " says Hsin Ping-lung . Hireability is based on two factors : good health and lifelong functional learning .  
" Besides the climatic and geographic advantages , this area has a unique background in terms of human history , " states Chen Chung . If hundreds of years ago Chinese had not flooded into Taiwan and occupied all the lowlying land , the Aboriginal peoples would never have been forced to move to high altitudes . When the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 , overnight the island was flooded with two million refugees and soldiers , creating an immediate shortage of arable land , and spawning an urgent need for development in the mountains .  
After a while , the bent of his writing gradually turned towards science fiction , philosophy , and the exploration of the human psyche . A self-proclaimed eclectic , Chang is n't content to stay within established genres , but instead casts a wide literary net that encompasses history , philosophy , movies , and politics .

Hence , investing in human capital , improving public administration and basic social services and creating an environment in which the private sector can play an essential role in the economic transformation are of paramount importance .  
For the purposes of advisory services and technical assistance , the term " national institution " is interpreted flexibly to mean any body which is established by a Government to play a central role in the domestic human rights situation .  
Ad hoc expert groups : a meeting will be held on national development experiences and policies with regard to domestic economic management , mobilizing financial and human resources and the roles of the public and private sectors ( 1994 ) .  
Technology is no longer a determinate and static component of manufacturing ; as with human resources , it is a variable in the production process that can be changed , improved and modified through innovative management .  
One of the main endeavours of the least developed countries is to achieve an optimum balance between human needs and the natural resources base in order to maximize their ability to meet these demands on a sustainable basis .  
That is particularly true as those States do not have a shining record in internal or external protection of human rights and do not offer in their own social experience a suitable moral and material environment for the welfare of human beings .  
We regard as inadmissible any violent changes of frontiers as well as " ethnic cleansing " accompanied by massive and flagrant violations of human rights .  
Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms can in no way be reconciled with biased criteria which divide countries into big and small , developed and underdeveloped , majority and minority groups , or along ethnic , racial and religious lines .  
We regret to observe , however , that the spread of conventional arms continues to take on a dangerous magnitude , while at the same time armed conflicts are increasing , causing the tragic loss of numerous innocent human lives .  
" Respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in civil , political , economic , social and cultural matters , as well as democratic values exemplified by free and regular elections ;  
This Cairo Declaration should be regarded as a tributary providing the proper foundation for positive and practical international cooperation and flowing into the main stream of universal support for human rights and freedoms .  
Its recent expansion from 3 to 10 full members makes ECO a major regional grouping and an important international entity with vast combined potential in terms of material and human resources .  
In order to achieve the required level of services , enhanced coordination and technological innovation were indispensable , but equally essential was the provision of adequate human and material resources .  
With its limited financial and human resources , it is trying to control the problem at the national level , and to contribute at a regional and international level in an integrated and comprehensive manner .  
Administered in accordance with the state of medical art they are indispensable , but if they are abused they can lead to enormous human suffering , loss of social status and disastrous economic consequences .  
Theirs is a noble task , critical for the saving of human lives in an international climate of recurrent and widespread regional conflicts and crises .

Calls upon all Member States to ensure that the achievements of scientific and technological progress and the intellectual potential of mankind are used for promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
These may be times of vertiginous political and technological change , but we sometimes feel discouraged at the persistence of tenacious negative aspects of the human condition rooted in selfishness and in the darkest chapters of our history .  
Religious and tribal fanaticism , national psyches scarred by past traumas , totalitarian regimes , selfish interests , and more all these may play a negative part in determining the future of human society in the next century .  
The right to an adequate standard of living is a universally recognized human right and should serve as a basis from which national and international policies are developed .

The precautionary principle requires authorities at entrepreneurial , national , regional and international levels to take preventive action when there is a risk of severe and irreversible damage to human beings by technology .  
The principle has been referred to and applied at the national level in relation to human activities with potentially severe effects on human health ( engineering , the pharmaceutical and chemical industries , nuclear power plants , etc . ) .  
Cutting down trees for firewood is also a major cause of deforestation in tropical dry forests and nonforest wooded areas located near dense human settlements in Africa and south Asia .

The Conference reaffirmed the basic principles governing international human rights activities , set out specific goals in a wide number of areas and identified various methods to achieve those objectives , including strengthening international cooperation .  
With small national markets , a weak human resource base , inadequate physical and institutional infrastructures and narrow production structures , the majority of African countries do not meet the requirements to be dynamic economic entities . 
However , during the thirteenth session , the Committee decided to adopt the practice now becoming common to all human rights treaty bodies and prepare a more detailed concluding comment to be included in the final report of the Committee .  
We , Heads of State and Government , are committed to an intellectual , spiritual and ethical vision for social development based on human dignity , equality , respect , mutual responsibility and cooperation .  
I also stressed that the international community would not invest additional human and material resources and risk lives in peacekeeping operations where political will did not make a substantive contribution to the peace process .  
Sound macroeconomic policies , a strong fiscal system , the development of human resources in environmental management and administrative efficiency are essential for successful internalization .  
Sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies , political stability , good governance , physical and institutional infrastructure and human resource development are a prerequisite for encouraging increased investment in Africa ;  
They express their growing concern over the continued spread of drug trafficking and the enormous danger it poses to social institutions , to the observance of human rights and to democratic stability in their countries .  
The relative effectiveness of warning and response systems is a direct consequence of the methodical scientific determination of relative risk or risks posed by specific hazards to conditions of human vulnerability .  
The raising of awareness about indigenous peoples must be seen not as the task of a Year but as part of the ongoing and permanent process of education and public information about human rights and the urgent need to protect and strengthen cultural diversity .  
In his statement , the SecretaryGeneral laid down his views on an effective human resource management system that could meet the challenges of the changing world situation with an efficient , dynamic and representative international civil service . 
Assistance to human resources development totalled US $ 56 million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
A military that has ultimate allegiance to the Constitution and other laws of the land , and to the democratic Government , and is trained in and committed to the principles of human rights and humanitarian law attending legitimate military duties ;  
The goal of such projects is to strengthen the capacity of such organizations to fulfil their legitimate and important role in generating a vigilant , continuous , informed and effective domestic demand for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The strategies , policies and programmes of States will promote sustainable development and the wellbeing of current and future generations by fostering a better life for human beings in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental domains .  
It fully shared the concern of the international community at the human rights violations committed in that country , and condemned the practices of ethnic cleansing and the acts of violence whose origins lay in racial hatred .  
The efforts of a United Nations Member in environmental protection have been reduced to those at the national level and it has been left to rely on its own modest material and human resources .  
Such determined arguments in the face of widespread and increasing suffering are clearly reprehensible and underlie a gross violation of the fundamental human rights of millions of innocent persons .  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the High Commissioner attaches special importance to the equal status and human rights of women .  
That language of human rights has been richly endowed by the United Nations with universal standards , international mechanisms and a solid ethical and legal framework for the rights and responsibilities of nations and peoples in their daily conduct .  
Encouraging public knowledge of human rights is the central goal of the programme , and the key role of national and regional institutions , nongovernmental organizations and civil society in human rights protection is largely recognized . 
It underlined that all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , were universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis .  
The Conference stressed that all persons who perpetrated or authorized criminal acts associated with ethnic cleansing were individually responsible and accountable for such human rights violations .  
With regard to preventive human rights policies , the European Union is confident that the imminent proclamation of the decade for human rights education will enhance meaningful respective action on the national and international levels .  
The large number of regional conflicts in which international humanitarian law and human rights were seriously violated indicated that there was an urgent need to take practical steps to achieve a form of universal criminal jurisdiction .  
The same was true in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , where ethnic cleansing , genocide and violations of the most fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law were being committed by the Serbs .  
In short , then , contemporary racism is a kind of anachronistic biological and cultural fundamentalism , given that the current trend of human societies is towards racial mixing and globalization . 
We , Heads of State and Government , are committed to a political , ethical and spiritual vision for social development based on human dignity , equality , respect , mutual responsibility and cooperation .  
The most vulnerable groups children , women , the elderly and the disabled were paying the highest price for shortsighted economic policies , political blunders , war and serious violations of human rights .  
" Alarmed by the high cost of organized transnational crime in both human and material terms , as well as by its effects on national economies , the global financial system , and the rule of law and fundamental social values ,  
We resolve to protect our societies from organized crime in all its forms through strict and effective legislative measures and operational instruments , always consistent with internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
On the political and economic levels , the world continued to be divided into rich countries and poor countries , a polarization which seriously threatened human survival and the maintenance of security and peace .  
Under the new Constitution , specific forms of administrative organization could be granted to some human settlements in the east and south of the country under precise juridical provisions adopted through constitutional laws .  
The investigation of human rights violations in the world and the moral sanctioning of regimes responsible for grave and systematic violations was a great achievement by the United Nations human rights system and should be maintained and improved .  
While no one disputed the universal nature of human rights , it was necessary to take account of the historical , cultural , religious and social situations of each country in order to ensure the effective implementation of such rights .  
His Government had repeatedly expressed its opposition to that initiative because it clearly violated the most basic human rights of migrant workers and their families set forth in various international legal instruments .  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Second , there is the question as to how specific intent to commit an act of genocide ( where an accused is alleged to have killed a single human being ) is to be distinguished from an act of ordinary murder or the killing of several from mass murder . 
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Hungary strongly condemned the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iraq , where the Government was implicated in summary executions , political killings , systematic torture and the repression of ethnic and religious minorities .  
Hungary remained extremely concerned about continuing human rights violations , including extrajudicial and summary executions , widespread detention , torture , forced labour and discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities .  
" Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Poverty eradication and social and economic policies for standards of living must be based on a recognition of the human dignity of the poor , the weak and the humble .  
Urges the High Commissioner to undertake initiatives for refugee women in the areas of leadership and skills training , legal awareness and education , and in particular in the area of reproductive health , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of the refugees , in conformity with universally recognized international human rights and the UNHCR Guidelines on the Protection of Refugee Women ;  
It was noted that the Moroccan Constitution established the equality of all citizens before the law and the rights of foreigners in Morocco , that Morocco had recently set up an advisory council for human rights composed of representatives of all parties concerned , and that bilateral and multilateral conventions ratified in the manner prescribed by the Constitution were incorporated in domestic law and their provisions could be invoked before Moroccan courts .  
It is noted with satisfaction that Senegal has been actively supporting international human rights activities at both the international and regional levels and that it is a party to numerous international human rights instruments , including all the major United Nations instruments under which supervisory mechanisms have been established .  
The Holy See approved of the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , which is an expression of the international community 's commitment to fighting violations of human rights , and it expressed its support by making a symbolic contribution to the special fund established by the Secretary-General to finance the activities of the Tribunal .  
During this Week , we should express our faith in the foundations of harmonious coexistence of peoples , the need to promote international cooperation , the defence and protection of human rights , progress , economic and social development and the full flourishing of democracy .  All of this should undoubtedly lead to the maintenance of authentic and stable peace .  
Besides , it is insufficiently acknowledged that democracy is merely a species of human rights and that human rights are composed of diverse elements , including those of a cultural , developmental , economic and social nature .  
This is equally true in the economic and social sphere , and with regard to the constant modernization and honing of democratic institutions , governance , control of the exercise of political power , full and absolute respect for human rights and the daily exercise of such rights and obligations on the part both of those who govern and of those who are governed .  
" The rights protected by the Constitution [ of the Federation ] include all those currently recognized in international human rights law and others which have not yet attained full international recognition .  There is also specific enumeration of a package of rights which would entirely reverse the effects of the practice of \ x { e50d } thnic cleansing . . .  
At the heart of democracy and its inherent political pluralism are certain basic guarantees that uphold the sovereignty of the people , the worth and dignity of the individual , the rule of law , full respect for and protection of fundamental human rights and , above all , the peaceful search for human development .  
The Executive Committee expressed its deep concern and preoccupation with the immense human suffering and loss of life in recent crises and the scale and complexity of current refugee problems , and deplored the incidence of armed attack and of murder , rape and other violations of fundamental rights , as well as refoulement and denial of access to safety .  
The development of the human and technical resources that are indispensable for the improvement of information and communication systems in developing countries and support for the continuation and strengthening of practical training programmes , such as those already operating under both public and private auspices throughout the developing world ;  
The greatest national benefit will be obtained if the exercise is based on the overall principles adopted by in-country preparatory processes , i.e . , the participation of civic leaders , the academic and scientific community , grass-roots community leaders and non-governmental and community-based organizations , the private sector and human settlements professionals .  
For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds , the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including , where applicable , the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights . "  
It follows that the existence of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights in a country does not as such constitute a sufficient ground for determining that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture upon his return to that country ; additional grounds must exist that indicate that the individual concerned would be personally at risk .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , Recalling chapters 7 and 28 of Agenda 21 , dd / adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the main objective of which is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor ,  
Recalling further General Assembly resolution 43 / 181 of 20 December 1988 , by which the Assembly adopted the Global Strategy for Shelter to the Year 2000 oo / and stated that enabling policies , whereby the full potential and resources of all governmental and non-governmental actors in the field of human settlements were utilized , were to be at the heart of national and international efforts ,  
The Assistant Secretary-General then stated that rural human settlements issues should not be neglected , as the overall situation of the urban and rural poor had become worse , with 40 per cent more people living in absolute poverty compared to 15 years ago .  
In its proposed work programme for 1996-1997 , UNEP planned to support the work of the Centre in improving the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people .  Finally , the Executive Director assured the Commission that she would carry out all the extra tasks that would arise out of Habitat II .  
It is the United Nations which , not limiting itself to those classical human rights born of the American and the French revolutions , consecrated the fundamental rights of the second generation and , in particular , economic , social and cultural rights which allowed it to enrich the contribution of liberalism of the century of enlightenment through the contribution of democratic socialism of the nineteenth century .  
Their vision can only be realized through a collective adherence to a common purpose based on the principles of equity , tolerance and social justice , by expanding human capacity and the attainment of human security through equitable development and the achievement of global sustainability .  
The Organization originated in the post-war era with the main objective of consolidating an international order founded on faith in fundamental human rights , the dignity and worth of the human person ; and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; an organization specifically mandated to maintain international peace and security and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
During the past half century the United Nations , as no other international organization , has acquired credibility as a reliable instrument for maintaining peace , as a mediator and active participant in the peaceful settlement of conflicts , and as a champion of human rights .  
At that meeting it was also said that better quality of life for all was the objective of sustainable development , the foundations of which are democracy , human rights , transparent and responsible management of public affairs , investment in the human individual and protection of the environment .  
The problems threatening international peace which arouse natural fears , create anxiety , work against the people 's well-being , cause enormous losses of human life and bring about an immense deterioration of social and economic development are no doubt the gravest problems , and they call for action for peace by all means possible . 
Neither massive economic assistance , nor a huge international presence can make a real difference if the human rights questions are left unaddressed .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
Based on the agreement concluded between the two organizations , we have indeed developed flexible forms of cooperation , not only in the political area , but in our joint efforts on humanitarian issues , human rights , sanctions-monitoring and operational presence .  
In this context , my delegation would like to voice its support for the United Nations ongoing work on initiatives relating to the Agenda for Development , which would help us find more pragmatic approaches to development and address the aforementioned economic , social and human security issues in all their dimensions in a more effective and fruitful manner .  
The deliberate creation of regional trading blocs , the introduction of managed trade and the attempts to link human rights , environmental considerations and labour codes to trade are major threats which , if implemented , would dim the hope of a free environment for trade .  
Nevertheless , the systematic abuse of human rights which tactical allies were allowed to engage in , and which also characterized the Soviet Union and its areas of influence , reduced the ethical quality of the world inherited after the ending of the cold war .  
We also need to reinforce the capacity of the United Nations to assist Member States in their efforts to improve democratic structures , including the holding of free and fair elections , the full observance of human rights , the rights of minorities and fundamental freedoms , the strengthening of the rule of law , the fostering of popular participation and accountability of Governments , and the development of a prosperous civil society .  
Though this sense of equality was repressed for three centuries by pragmatic measures that were respected but not implemented , and by the extreme zeal of monks who consulted no one in imposing a single faith on this immense geographical area , it was imbued with the spaciousness of the land , the rivers , the forests , the gentle climate , the mountains and prairies , whose influence produced a different type of human character .  
The volume of assistance we offered was the highest , in terms of gross national product , because we wanted to live in a world dominated by justice , a world whose hallmark is human compassion , a world in which the privileged will reach out towards the underprivileged without strings attached .  
There is an increasing realization worldwide that in major denials of human rights , which breed antagonisms and deep resentments , there lie the seeds of international discord as surely as in the clashes of economic rivalries and territorial ambitions .  
At the same time , we are convinced that genuine and representative democracy , free from foreign interference , must be the key element in preserving peace and observing the basic principles of respect for the fundamental rights of the human person and of economic and social development .  
After engaging in broad contacts within the system of Asian States , we have once again become convinced of the correctness of the conclusion drawn at the beginning of this century that Asia , with its enormous human , natural and intellectual resources , had every possibility of becoming the most prosperous region in the world .  
No one should rest satisfied while we are faced with the perpetuation of social and economic disparities between and within nations largely the result of parochial interests being pursued at the expense of genuine human concerns .  
It must be built upon and strengthened , recognizing always that the human rights whose universality and indivisibility we assert are about economic and social and cultural rights just as much as about the civil and political rights on which the developed countries tend to focus so much attention .  
The point is that , in such cases , there should be a minimum level of safeguards , through the application of a set of agreed , uniform rules and procedures , in order for the imposing and lifting of sanctions to take place in a manner that strikes a balance between , on the one hand , the interests of the international community and , on the other , the extent of the human suffering endured by peoples on whom the sanctions are imposed .  
Moreover , the selective policies pursued by some developed countries in liberalizing their trade and the disguised protectionist policies which are put in place behind a fa \ x { 84f7 } de of environmental , human rights or other considerations , contradict the spirit and the call for liberalizing international trade and would lead to the worsening and entrenchment of the present imbalances .  We welcome the World Trade Organization as it begins its work .  
Panama , which is today a stable and secure democracy respectful of human rights , with a Government that represents with full legitimacy a people determined to shape for itself a great future of peace and well-being , wishes to remain the cross-roads of international trade , open to all parts of the world , where , in an era of globalization and market integration , the goods and services that are the principal wealth produced by nations can circulate .  
But this is not a time for fear or regrets ; it is a time for new endeavours , a time to promote new forms , ways and means of international cooperation , with a view to generating , by cultivating the complementary development of our national individualities , the cultural , economic and human resources that can enable us to be free of poverty and backwardness and to open an ever-broadening road to understanding , tolerance , peace and prosperity as we enter the third millennium .  
It is precisely its global character which offers us its first and fundamental key and which confirms that there are indeed universal human rights rooted in the nature of the person , rights which reflect the objective and inviolable demands of a universal moral law .  
A decisive factor in the success of those nonviolent revolutions was the experience of social solidarity ; in the face of regimes backed by the power of propaganda and terror , that solidarity was the moral core of the power of the powerless , a beacon of hope and an enduring reminder that it is possible for man 's historical journey to follow a path which is true to the finest aspirations of the human spirit .  
In this wider breakthrough of understanding in the universe , let us be thankful that on this tiny planet there is on the East River in New York a piece of land where people meet to discuss problems some no bigger than an ant-hill and some larger thankful that somewhere there is a little hill called Everest near Kathmandu where lilliputian human ants can crawl up and become heroes !  
The Beijing Conference , along with the other global conferences held at Rio , Barbados , Cairo and Copenhagen , have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development , which must be informed by environmental , social , demographic , gender and human - resource considerations .  
But what would it have been like had the United Nations not existed to channel activities for peace , to oversee the post-war period and the cold war , to give its moral sanction to the emancipation of peoples , to coordinate assistance for economic and social development and to set a moral standard and order relations among nations and human beings ?  
Natural resources restored , revived and protected from continuous and uncoordinated overexploitation must be managed by citizens , families and communities , who shall learn to acquire know-how , to share knowledge , to spread information , and to tap both the vast , exciting stockpile of human knowledge and their own rich national culture .  
Thus , for those who believe that the African is less than human or is incapable of governing himself , the existence for almost a century and a half of a politically stable and peaceful Liberia with strong economic potential is undesirable .  
The international community 's ability to offer a decent and secure existence to all its citizens is called into question by the numerous human tragedies , atrocities of war , terrorism , traffic in illegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of our planet .  It is self-evident that global cooperation and effective action is a sine qua non for effectively combating these and other evils tormenting world society .  
Such developments have been accompanied by a natural yearning for the achievement of development in both its economic and social domains , while developments on the negative side have generated a wider cycle of racial , national and religious disputes in some regions of the world that have led to a noticeable retreat from respect for human rights and basic freedoms of the human individual , as well as regression of development both in the economic and social spheres .  
Perhaps this new humanitarian world order , because of its aims which would make the human being the main focus of international action in such areas as the eradication of poverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gap between the rich and the poor , on both the individual and societal levels , may well furnish the solid foundation upon which we can build the desired new world order whose parameters have not crystallized as yet .  
The United Nations is to be credited with impressive accomplishments in strengthening international peace and security , marshalling the efforts of the international community to put an end to colonialism and apartheid , ensuring the independence and sovereignty of developing countries and supporting their socio-economic development , advocating human rights and fundamental freedoms and protecting and preserving the environment , as well as in promoting education , culture , science and health .  
On the contrary , despite our smallness and our relative lack of resources , we have been a consistent and active contributor of troops to various peace-keeping missions .  Fiji has paid a heavy human and financial price for contributing troops , but it has done so gladly and willingly and will continue to do so .  
At the same time , the General Assembly must always be solicitous of this principal organ when it comes to preserving the dignity of eminent international judges and their staff and when human and material resources are required to enhance the efficacy of this institution and to promote good and diligent administration of international justice .  
Moreover , this initiative fell within a favourable context of human dimension and a framework of values and hopes that were largely shared by sovereign States and Governments linked by their use of the French language , which greatly helped the Agency first to be recognized internationally and then to grow .  
We also applaud the focus the Secretary-General has placed on practical international cooperation for global human security , for example , in the areas of emergency humanitarian assistance , effective governance and the key social issues which formed the agenda of the World Summit on Social Development .  
Regrettably , this great historic victory was attained at a high price : the heavy of loss of human lives , incredible suffering , unprecedented material losses .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
But the Organization now needs to rethink itself in order to devote all its resources human , financial , institutional and technical to the great undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and social imbalances and the related problems of the environment , in the conviction that this is not only a moral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening peace .  
None the less , the United Nations attained important and substantial achievements , outstanding among which were its significant contributions to avoiding another world war with unimaginable consequences , eliminating colonialism and racial discrimination , encouraging the codification of international law , strengthening the international system of human rights protection and promoting international cooperation for the improvement of the political , economic and social conditions of our peoples .  
In fact , many are unprepared to accept that human beings and nations are entitled to move steadily upward on economic , social , political and cultural trajectories which will provide genuine equality . 
At this crucial juncture in human history we are compelled by social and economic imperatives , characterized by growing poverty and marginalization of the powerless and the weak , to choose a course of action that will empower the citizens of the world to develop their full potential in order to enable them to secure their basic needs and improve their livelihood .  
The commitment of resources at both the national and international levels ought to be focused on the development of programmes that place priority on the development of human capacities , and removing institutional and infrastructural impediments in order to facilitate sustained economic growth and sustainable development . 
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
This half century will also be remembered as a time of tremendous waste of human creativity and energy for purposes of destruction , a time of rising disparities between nations , of flagrant abuse of nature and its finite resources and , above all , of unprecedented loss of human lives and human deprivation despite the infinite possibilities opened up by revolutions in science and technology .  
International conflicts have been replaced by internal ones , characterized by political , economic , ethnic and religious tensions that often imply grave humanitarian crises and human rights violations .  
Notwithstanding the impressive achievements of the human race we are forced to live at the same time with unspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritual progress in which we might feel some pride as we approach the new century .  
They also underlined the necessity to reinforce the efforts and the measures directed to safeguarding the observance of human rights , in particular those related to education and work , calling on national , regional and international organizations to support the global development of the young generation under the sign of understanding , progress and friendship .  
The generation that enters the year 2000 faced with a perceptible crisis of ethical and moral values must renew with more vigour than ever its commitment to society , guided always by its convictions and never by considerations of convenience , respecting human rights and struggling with all its force for the perennial principles of justice , freedom and equality for all .  
As rightly observed and recognized , young people in all countries are both a major human resource for development and key agents for social change , economic development and technological innovation .  
Therefore , an overall system of enabling mechanisms is necessary , engaging the human , political , economic , financial and socio-cultural resources necessary for the World Programme of Action to be implemented on the national , regional and international level .  
A top priority of the programme has been the objective of eradicating poverty from the world as well as the commitment , on the national level , to take decisive action and on the international level to cooperate in the common endeavour to achieve that objective by focusing , both in policies and in action , on dealing with the root causes of poverty and on satisfying the human needs of all .  
Since its independence in 1956 , Tunisia has engaged in a comprehensive campaign to free Tunisians from poverty , ignorance and disease , as well as to ensure dignity and to build the basis for a modern national State as part of a complete development strategy based on investment in the human factor , and aimed at building a fully-balanced society that embraces all its segments without distinction .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran , inspired by the divine teachings of Islam and benefiting from national solidarity and the continued participation and efforts of its people , has endeavoured to develop a society on the basis of the dignity and worth of the human person and respect for human values , a society whose ethos includes fairness and social justice as well as cultural , social and economic development .  
These are some of the reasons that justify a rapprochement between Governments and the national olympic committees , and , moreover , that between the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee , with the objective of achieving democratic societies made up of citizens who are active in their defence of close and lasting human relations .  
It is my feeling that the United Nations and the Olympic Movement share a single universal ideal : to promote peace and understanding among nations and among peoples , with all their differences and their complementary features , by contributing to bringing cultures closer together and to promoting friendship among human beings in this world so often battered and torn apart .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations , as enshrined in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Georgiades ( Cyprus ) : In a world faced with unabated turmoil , the ancient Greek spirit that gave rise to the Olympian ideal of athletic achievement and excellence transcends the cultural and political boundaries that divide human communities .  
Throughout the gradual transition , the summit meetings of the Central American Presidents have institutionalized the process of regional integration and have given concrete form to the commitments undertaken in Esquipulas II , in which Central America pledged to struggle for peace and eradicate war , to ensure that dialogue prevailed over violence and reason over rancour , to give impetus to real democratic processes , and to promote justice and respect for human rights . 
The new principles of regional integration are based on respect for life in all its forms ; constant improvements in the quality of life ; respect for the vitality and diversity of our land ; peace , participatory democracy ; respect for and the promotion and protection of human rights , and respect for the multiculturalism and ethnic diversity of our peoples ; the economic integration of our region with the rest of the world ; and a responsibility that spans generations for sustainable development .  
The world community must continue to afford effective assistance to the Central American countries in averting new outbreaks of tension , in ensuring that the processes of national reconciliation in the subregion are irreversible by creating solid democratic bases for State structures , in strengthening the climate of political tolerance , in the strict observance of human rights , and in their economic recovery .  
In this respect , it must be emphasized that a solid democratic and pluralistic system , based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the covenants and international conventions on human rights , is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development , improving the standard of living of the lowest-income segments of society , and promoting civil and political freedoms and equality of opportunities . 
As we see it , the value of democratization is primarily that , having become an integral part of the internal political processes , it provides a basis for reconciliation , tolerance , full application of , respect for and defence of human rights , and the development of social practices based on the peaceful search for constructive solutions .  
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
The increase in the number of Member States to 185 ; the end of the cold war and the concomitant , regrettable radicalization of nationalism and group identity , which cause internal and inter-State conflicts ; and the perverse effects of the economic and financial crisis on the democratization of institutions and on human rights all these events and challenges highlight the urgent need to carry out a reform of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular . 
We are sure that these first 50 years are but the first stage in an unprecedented task that presents no other alternative , given that its chief goal that of assuring that we all live together in peace , as well as the comprehensive development of human beings can be attained only through disinterested cooperation among peoples .  
We do recognize also that there are some legitimate considerations that have to be addressed in the negotiating process , including internal territorial delineations and means to rebuild the confidence of the population in the political processes and mechanisms that are designed to secure respect for human rights .  
The tragic human suffering and the terrible material destruction brought about by more than 20 years of conflict also require that the international community following the round table on Angola being held in Brussels under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme continues to respond generously to the humanitarian aid needs and the challenge of reconstructing the country , particularly in the areas of demining and the social reintegration of the displaced and the demobilized . 
These variable criteria are subject to historical , human , demographic , political , economic , territorial and other changes .  
The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean certainly want such technical cooperation to be increased and more intensified and would like to see the United Nations double or even triple its human and financial efforts in order to fulfil this obligation , which is inscribed in the Charter and in countless resolutions of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies .  
Its contribution to disseminating information about the importance of free and fair elections , the participation of women and men as equal partners in social , economic and political life , and the protection and promotion of human rights and individual freedom has undoubtedly been singular .  
Greater cooperation here would make it possible for many of these challenges democracy and human rights , integration , development , international cooperation , and administrative matters such as the financing of the activities of the United Nations to be faced in optimal conditions and for there to be fluid channels of communication between the United Nations and national parliamentary bodies .  
We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .  
The Acting President : This morning , the General Assembly will , in accordance with the decision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting and pursuant to its resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 , devote a special commemorative plenary meeting at its fiftieth session to mark the United Nations Year for Tolerance , under sub-item ( b ) of agenda item 112 , Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The United Nations must tirelessly continue to demonstrate to the men and women of this era that the prevailing openness in the world offers a formidable opportunity for the future , an unexpected chance to transcend our differences in order to attain what I once referred to as the irreducible human element , that is , the quintessence of the values by which we define ourselves as a single human community .  
May this final celebration of the United Nations Year for Tolerance therefore also serve as the occasion on which we call for the redoubling of our efforts to close the apparent divides between us and overcome our momentary differences , our ideological and cultural barriers .  Let all of us therefore continue together , well beyond this special year , to work within the United Nations to instil the spirit of tolerance in the heart of the human community ( SG / SM / 5814 ) .  
In our view , the increasing awareness of the need to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms is closely and organically linked to and essential for the progress of society and the advancement of its members at the economic , political , cultural and social levels .  
The Charter establishes an important and immediate link between the cooperation necessary in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and the promotion and encouragement of and respect for universal human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Since prejudice denotes an irrational , unfavourable or hostile attitude towards members of other racial , religious or ethnic groups , we must , if we truly desire its defeat , engage ourselves in promoting , enhancing and defending the universal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
To meet the growing need for civilian personnel during crises , Canada will offer the United Nations secondment or the loan of civilian personnel on a short-term urgent basis to help in the development of a fully trained capacity in the areas of human rights , legal advice , humanitarian assistance , and other aspects of a rapid civilian response to crises . 
The national reconstruction plan and the economic and social development plan are based primarily based on sustainable human development through medium - and long-term programmes targeting the population affected by the conflict and the most vulnerable sectors of society in order to improve the quality of life and social mobility by improving the systems of education , of health , of housing and of creating sustainable employment . 
They pointed out that the responsibility of the United Nations in this matter should continue until the Palestinian people are able to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination , until an independent and sovereign State is established within its national territory and until the problem of refugees is settled in conformity with human rights instruments and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations .  
They now face the challenging tasks of reviving and modernizing national institutions , designing and developing both the human and the physical infrastructures , and rebuilding the economy by revitalizing agriculture , industry and trade and social services all with extremely limited resources and formidable impediments . 
We also reaffirm the importance of a continued role by the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the peace process and call upon Israel to honour its commitments under relevant resolutions of international legality in the interests of a better future of peace , tolerance , human development and economic and social development in the region .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
Recognizing that it is primarily responsible for its own development , and in keeping with commitments entered into under UN-NADAF , Africa has recently become involved in far-reaching and difficult reforms designed to accelerate the process of democratization , promote human rights and achieve economic , social and cultural development , in a climate of transparency and with the active participation of all positive forces .  
We should not lose sight of the efforts and activities by Africa to promote , enhance and achieve sustained economic growth and social development by addressing existing structural weaknesses , particularly building and expanding inadequate human , institutional and infrastructural capacities .  
We should resolutely address the endogenous impediments to growth and development , which include political instability , ineffective and inefficient utilization of both human and material resources , inappropriate priority-setting , ill-conceived policy orientation and ill-designed and impractical implementation mechanisms . 
A common agreement was reached in Copenhagen aimed at creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment , based on democracy , full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , equality between men and women , the elimination of all forms of discrimination , solidarity , transparent and accountable governance and administration , and the encouragement of partnership with free and representative organizations of civil society . 
Together , we decided on priorities and goals , and the Social Summit formulated a consensus strategy that generated the political will indispensable to the promotion of the human dimension of development as a priority objective , in particular in order to overcome poverty , increase productive employment and bring about social integration .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
We need to eradicate social and economic inequalities , both nationally and internationally , to create a stable , peaceful and healthy environment conducive to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Consensus in Beijing revolved around these basic principles : violence against women must stop ; girls must be valued equally with boys ; women must have equal access to education , health care and the levers of economic and political power ; family responsibilities should be shared ; and the human rights of women are an integral component of all human rights they are neither separable nor different from those of men .  
Thus , from the outset , CARICOM States have attached the highest importance to achieving the basic goals of the international community , which are reaffirmed in the resolution before us ; in particular , restoration of democratic order in Haiti , including the full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and the promotion of economic and social development .  
In this regard , it is essential for African countries themselves to promote sustainable development and greater political stability through , inter alia , State structures adapted to the new realities , the establishment of democratic political systems , a responsible and transparent management of public affairs , and respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
These figures highlight the fact that this is not a static problem ; it is a recurring humanitarian crisis that is worsening day by day and requires greater efforts and political will if we are to put an end to this inhumane situation in which human lives are destroyed , as is the environment as a whole .  
Our member organizations are situated around the centre of the ideological scale , our main principles being the promotion of civil society , individual human and civil rights , the collective rights of minorities and other endangered peoples and the achievement of peace and security on the basis of sustainable development , environmental protection and free-market economy .  
We urge the Special Committee to take very careful note of the documentation presented to it by Amnesty International , by other human rights groups and by East Timorese in exile , which details the ongoing human rights abuses in East Timor , such as torture , involuntary disappearances , maltreatment of political prisoners and extrajudicial killings .  The recent killing by the Indonesian military of 6 civilians in Liquica is but one example .  
So I ask Member States , when they hear us speaking out about the perils of radiation , to think about these in terms of human suffering and to try to visualize Marshallese children being born faceless , with no bones , or with missing or extra limbs the jellyfish babies , as some have come to call them and the irreparable damage wreaked upon the reproductive health of their mothers .  
In this so-called new era in which bipolar confrontation no longer exists , it is especially regrettable that the international community should be unable to arrive at a firm commitment on nuclear disarmament and on the complete elimination of these weapons of mass destruction , which continue to endanger the very survival of the human race .  
Emphasizing the importance of the integration of documented migrants into the host society , with due respect for their religious and cultural background , and the need to extend to them the same social , economic and legal rights as are enjoyed by citizens , in accordance with national legislation and universally recognized human rights ,  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development [ 4 ] / is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at providing the United Nations system , on a stand-by basis , with specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation , and , in this regard , notes with satisfaction the establishment , in particular in developing countries , of national volunteer corps ;  
Bearing in mind that the Treaty of Chaguaramas , signed at Chaguaramas , Trinidad and Tobago , on 4 July 1973 , 1 / which established the Caribbean Community , created a permanent body for intraregional cooperation , consultation and coordination in order to enhance economic , social and cultural development , including the optimum utilization of available human resources for sustainable development ,  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance and respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted at youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
Given the very low levels of per capita energy consumption in rural households in the developing countries at present , the absolute rise in residential energy consumption needs to be very rapid simply to satisfy basic human needs .  
States Members of the United Nations are invited to develop and implement an integrated national action programme for the development of and transition to an energy system that allows socio-economic development to fulfil basic human needs and improve the quality of life , takes care of environmental concerns , guarantees security of supply and uses finite resources sparingly , in the interest of present and future generations .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-19 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 20 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
" Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
He wished to draw attention to the suffering caused to the Libyan people by the unjust imposition of the sanctions , which had endangered many innocent lives , particularly those of the most vulnerable members of society , in blatant violation of human rights guaranteed under international human rights instruments .  
Japan appreciated the role played by the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in providing advisory services and technical and financial assistance at the request of Governments and the role played by regional human rights machinery in supporting human rights activities and programmes .  
The United States urged China to take further steps to improve the human rights situation in its territory by observing international norms , preserving Tibet 's unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage and releasing persons jailed solely for expressing political beliefs .  
First , it would be very useful if each committee responsible for ensuring the implementation of an international human rights instrument , in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights and the necessary experts , issued a document specifying , on the one hand , those legislative norms which were contrary to the provisions of the instrument in question and , on the other hand , those which were most conducive to its implementation at the national level .  
In the knowledge that sustained economic growth and sustainable development were decisive for the integral realization of human rights , the United Nations should urgently focus on establishing a mechanism to ensure the balanced promotion of civil and political rights , on the one hand , and of economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
Algeria was aware that the promotion and protection of human rights and democratic principles were primarily the responsibility of Governments , and it assigned a prominent place to those rights and principles in its project for the construction of a modern State based on republican principles and on the alternation of political power .  
For that reason they firmly supported the establishment of a global partnership which addressed all human rights and recognized that the universal enjoyment of human rights was hindered by the crushing debt burden and by structural adjustment programmes .  
While the human rights situation had improved in various parts of the world , it had grown much worse in the former Yugoslavia , particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where the policy of ethnic cleansing , accompanied by inhuman practices of unprecedented violence , had led to the exodus of entire populations and caused countless victims .  
Costa Rica was convinced that the fullest possible utilization of the existing machinery for the protection of human rights , which was now better coordinated thanks to the actions of the High Commissioner - together with the political will of States , played a crucial role in achieving the goals set out in the Charter of the United Nations .  
In considering the human rights situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia , it should be understood that the violations of those rights were the result of the political programme of the Belgrade authorities , who were pursuing their objective of territorial expansion or " Greater Serbia " through " ethnic cleansing " .  
To create a focus in national development plans and budgets on investment in human capital , with special policies and programmes directed at rural areas , the urban poor , women and children .  
The overall human settlement objective is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor .  
Developing local strategies for improving the quality of life and the environment , integrating decisions on land use and land management , investing in the public and private sectors and mobilizing human and material resources , thereby promoting employment generation that is environmentally sound and protective of human health .  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
The objective is to provide for the land requirements of human settlement development through environmentally sound physical planning and land use so as to ensure access to land to all households and , where appropriate , the encouragement of communally and collectively owned and managed land .  6 / Particular attention should be paid to the needs of women and indigenous people for economic and cultural reasons .  
Developing industrial and non-industrial planted forests in order to support and promote national ecologically sound afforestation and reforestation / regeneration programmes in suitable sites , including upgrading of existing planted forests of both industrial and non-industrial and commercial purpose to increase their contribution to human needs and to offset pressure on primary / old-growth forests .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
In the light of recent developments including increased international attention to population and development , and shelter and human settlements , as well as questions relating to migrants , refugees , youth , ageing , disabled persons , minorities , women and the family , a large demand for new and enhanced databases is seen emerging around the world . 
The Turkish Grand National Assembly has been closing its eyes to the numerous examples of flagrant violation of human rights in Turkey itself , particularly to the internal war of the Turkish Army against the Kurds , who are denied fundamental national and political rights .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism and criminal acts , as well as illegal drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
The comprehensive and integrated approach to human rights means that those rights are understood to be universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , which enables all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , to be dealt with on an equal footing and in a fair and even-handed manner .  
Since it was established in 1945 , the United Nations has elaborated a comprehensive body of international human rights standards and put into place a complex system of international supervision of national respect for those standards , which provide the High Commissioner with a solid foundation on which to build his own specific activities .  The Office of the High Commissioner was not intended to replace or duplicate the existing mechanisms .  
A number of areas of common interest and joint action in human rights were identified , including the question of minorities , preventive action , fact-finding missions , seminars and training , advisory services and technical assistance , particularly with respect to constitutional and legal reform , democratic elections , the administration of justice and the strengthening of infrastructures for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
Trilateral forms of cooperation between the High Commissioner , CSCE and the Council of Europe will be strengthened in the areas mentioned above through regular yearly meetings , effective and timely sharing of information and the establishment of focal points on human rights issues in each of the respective offices .  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the High Commissioner attaches special importance to the equal status and human rights of women .  
This was a matter dealt with by the World Conference , which recognized the need for a continuing adaptation of the United Nations human rights machinery to the current and future needs in the promotion and protection of human rights , as reflected in the Vienna Declaration and within the framework of balanced and sustainable development .  
She concluded by stressing the need for the strict observance in the occupied territory of international human rights instruments and humanitarian law , particularly as set out in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , since such instruments were the sole guarantee of the promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people and were the instruments on which the Palestinian people relied for justice .  
She referred to the latest report of the Special Rapporteur , which confirmed the persistence of grave human rights violations , the systematic and daily slaughter of innocent people , the odious practice of ethnic cleansing and forced resettlement , even in the so-called " security " zones .  
Now , 20 years later , almost 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus , a sovereign , independent , democratic State and a Member of the United Nations , remained under occupation , and gross and massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be committed there .  
Meanwhile the Greek Cypriots living in the occupied territory ( whose numbers had dropped from 22,000 in 1974 to less than 550 in 1994 ) continued to be the victims of discriminatory measures , harassment and violent acts and to suffer human rights violations ( 1,619 Greek Cypriots had disappeared ) and systematic looting of the cultural heritage of Cyprus .  
At the same time , on the domestic front , Turkey is not prepared even to discuss a multi-ethnic and multicultural concept , hence flagrantly and on a large-scale basis violating the human , national and political rights of the Kurds , waging a real internal war against them .  
In cases where a peace-keeping operation has been necessary , we believe it is legitimate and useful for the United Nations to maintain a presence on the ground after the end of the operation in order to ensure that its action is followed up in such a way as to contribute to a lasting restoration of peace through measures for coordinated consolidation in the economic , social , institutional , electoral , humanitarian and human rights fields .  
This calls for the strengthening of preventive diplomacy , including developing adequate early warning capacities , dispatching field missions , and utilizing the good offices of Governments , international or regional organizations or eminent personalities in order to get to the source of an imminent conflict and safeguard the security , well-being and human rights of the affected civilian population .  
Priorities have to be assigned , using the Programme of Action as a guide , among potential topics - for example , certain aspects of human sexuality , sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS , preparation for family life , promoting the status of women , developing among girls a positive and future-oriented self-image , the dynamics and implications of rapid urbanization , male responsibility and so forth .  
UNFPA regards family planning as a central component of reproductive health care : it allows couples and individuals to meet their reproductive goals ; is essential in reducing maternal mortality and morbidity ; is indispensable in reducing the incidence of abortion ; and contributes to efforts to prevent the transmission of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , including human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .  
Recognizing that the grave suffering of the great majority of human beings who live in conditions of poverty demands the immediate attention of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of relevant forthcoming United Nations conferences , particularly the World Summit for Social Development , and within the context of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty ,  
His report was thus based on the information that he had gathered in those countries , on numerous reports of United Nations bodies and humanitarian organizations active in the southern Sudan and on detailed reports from reliable sources concerning the situation of human rights in the northern and southern regions of the Sudan .  
However , he placed the main emphasis , as in his earlier reports , on the fact that government agents and members of various factions of the parties to the conflict in the south were continuing to commit many serious human rights violations - extrajudicial executions , systematic tortures , arbitrary arrests of individuals suspected of being political opponents , etc . - which affected all categories and strata of the population . 
Demilitarization , the control of small arms , institutional reform , improved police and judicial systems , the monitoring of human rights , electoral reform and social and economic development can be as valuable in preventing conflict as in healing the wounds after conflict has occurred .  
As peace and security are closely interlinked with political , economic and social development , including democracy and the realization of human rights world wide , crisis management should consist of an adequate combination of diplomatic , military , legal , economic , environmental and social measures of stabilization .  
In his 4 November 1994 report ( paras . 79-86 ) , the Special Rapporteur concluded , inter alia , that Bosnian Serb de facto authorities continued to be responsible for large-scale violations of human rights and , both directly and indirectly , for displacement of people from areas under their control , for systematic military attacks on civilians in the " safe areas " and elsewhere , and for grave disruption of humanitarian aid and medical evacuation programmes .  
In the Republic of Croatia , the Zagreb-based field staff through its numerous contacts with non-governmental organizations , its participation in relevant conferences and its exceptional access to top government officials , provided the Special Rapporteur with vital information , enabling him to make timely observations on the changing human rights situation .  
In reply to the question whether human rights education was incorporated in the school curricula , the representatives stated that attempts were under way to develop human rights education based on a national evaluation of the comprehensive school system , which set as basic criteria the respect for human dignity and for life .  
Responding to questions regarding health care plans for prostitutes , the representative emphasized that the authorities focused on the health aspect and instituted mandatory medical visits for prostitutes in order to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) / acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .  
Many crucial steps remain to be taken to achieve the political , economic , social and institutional reconstruction of Haiti and to provide for the Haitian people a peaceful and stable future based on democracy , respect for human rights and the rule of law and on economic and social justice .  
Serious violations of human rights and the mass exodus of a considerable portion of the Haitian population for political or economic reasons called for prompt and resolute action on the part of the international community , the United Nations and the Organization of American States .  
Globalization , which is a consequence of increased human mobility , enhanced communications , greatly increased trade and capital flows and technological developments , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy , particularly in developing countries . 
We , Heads of State and Government , are committed to a political , economic , ethical and spiritual vision for social development based on human dignity , human rights , equality , respect , peace , democracy , mutual responsibility and cooperation , and full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people .  
On the basis of our common pursuit of social development , which aims at social justice , solidarity , harmony and equality within and among countries , in full respect for national sovereignty [ and territorial integrity ] , as well as policy objectives , development priorities and religious and cultural diversity , and full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , we launch a global drive for social progress and development embodied in the following commitments :  
Reaffirm and promote all human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , and strive to ensure that they are respected , protected and observed .  
Promote changes in attitudes , structures , policies , laws and practices in order to eliminate all obstacles to human dignity , equality and equity in the family and society ; and promote full and equal participation of urban and rural women , and women with disabilities , in social , economic and political life , including in the formulation , implementation and follow-up of public policies and programmes ;  
Implement at the national level structural adjustment policies , which should include social development goals , and effective development strategies that establish a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resource development and further promote the development of democratic institutions ;  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It requires democratic institutions , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , increased and equal economic opportunities , the rule of law , promotion of respect for cultural diversity and rights of persons belonging to minorities and an active involvement of the civil society .  
Such an inclusive society must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
According to the Human Development Report 1994 , Chile had ranked eighth out of 97 developing countries in 1992 in the human development index , which took into account such indicators as infant mortality , daily caloric intake , adult literacy and average number of years of schooling .  
Ms . BARYARUHA ( Uganda ) said that prior to 1986 , Uganda 's human rights record had been among the worst in the world , and the country was still recovering from more than two decades of political instability and civil strife which had brought about social disintegration and a total breakdown of infrastructure .  
I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session under the agenda item entitled " Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " . 
Promoting effective enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and access to existing social protection and public services by , in particular , through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of all relevant human rights instruments ;  
They typically possess limited institutional and human resource capacity to assess the implications for sustainable agricultural and rural development of ongoing developmental plans .  
At the same time , many non-governmental organizations note and are concerned that factors such as distance , limited human and financial resources , and unequal access to information are tending to distinguish between those non-governmental organizations that are closely following international processes and those , particularly in the developing world , that are not .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The successful peaceful transition of South Africa to a democratic and non-racial society with human rights safeguarded by an entrenched Charter of Fundamental Rights has nevertheless left cultural , economic and social inequalities reflecting historical deprivation .  
Requests the Secretary-General , without further delay , to provide the Special Rapporteur with all the necessary human and financial assistance in carrying out his mandate and enabling him to submit in a timely manner an interim report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session under the item entitled " Elimination of racism and racial discrimination " .  [ 1 ] / A / 49 / 677 , annex .  
Considerable resources , both human and financial , have been devoted to the process over the past two years , in relation to support to the ad hoc secretariat , to Governments in affected countries , to the definition of the technical , scientific and political issues involved and to the formulation of the texts of the Convention and the regional annexes .  
Taking into account the positive developments in the process , which to some extent allay the concerns of the Council as expressed in its resolution 966 ( 1994 ) , my Government considers that the conditions have been created for the speedy constitution of a UNAVEM III with a specific mandate as set forth in the Lusaka Protocol , including technical , material and human resources sufficient for it to carry out its mandate .  
Indeed , despite the precarious situation and the difficulties inherent in moving from confrontation to cooperation on the path to national reconciliation , the steps taken by both parties and the stages that have already been passed have greatly helped to meet the conditions for the systematic implementation of the Lusaka Protocol , with a United Nations presence , whose human and material resources can measure up to its tasks . 
Invites the international development agencies and organizations , including the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations Development Programme , to take account of the potential of elderly women as a human resource for development and to include older women in their development strategies and programmes , and encourages Governments to ensure the inclusion of women , regardless of age , in development projects covered by national and multilateral financial institutions ;  
The three main objectives of the conference would be ( a ) to mobilize a political and economic " mountain lobby " capable of demonstrating to Governments , policy makers and planners the potential contribution of mountain areas to national and regional development ; ( b ) to introduce the financial and planning instruments needed to incorporate mountain development into national plans and budgets ; and ( c ) to examine the specific human , social and technological characteristics of mountain areas .  
Broad parliamentary support would be required to change the legal situation , especially in view of strong opposition from the Catholic Church , whose moral authority had been enhanced by its defence of human rights under the military dictatorship .  
Many non-governmental organizations feel that progress could be faster , pointing to continued forest damage and the apparently low levels of grass-roots involvement , and calling for the implementation of the FAO Peasants Charter to correct skewed land ownership or access patterns , which concentrate human pressure on the few forests that are accessible to the poor , thereby contributing to their degradation and loss .  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The criteria ( attached as annex II ) reflect the following top sustainable human development priorities for UNDP cooperation with Bangladesh : relevance to country programme objectives ; institutional and social sustainability ; environmental sensitivity ; targeting of the chronically poor ; affirmative action for women ; public management ; participation of beneficiaries and private organizations ; and national execution .  
The Committee suggests that the State party take steps to ensure the effective coordination between the existing institutions involved in the areas of human rights and children 's rights with a view to establishing a monitoring mechanism for the implementation of the Convention at the national , regional and local levels , which may assess the actual situation of children and narrow the gap between the law and its practice .  
The Committee recommends that the State party strengthen the coordination between the different governmental mechanisms involved in human rights and children 's rights , at both the national and local levels , and ensure a closer cooperation with non-governmental organizations , with a view to developing a comprehensive policy on children and ensuring an effective evaluation of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the country .  
Such an assessment was confirmed by the final document of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that the human rights of women and of the girl child were an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights ; that they should form an integral part of the United Nations human rights activities and be regularly and systematically addressed . 
In the area of poverty alleviation , sustainable human development will have to be promoted at the local level through support of the decentralization process and a strengthening of the technical , managerial and administrative capacity of local bodies , particularly departmental development councils and municipalities .  
The longer this situation continues , the more likely it is that we will be faced with a genuine structural public-service problem leading to inefficient use of national human capacities and a waste of resources .  
To summarize , the exact content and quantitative objectives of a Tunisian policy on sustainable human development , which will be reflected in the country strategy note , will emerge from the process of formulating Tunisia 's Agenda 21 and strategic studies conducted in the context of preparations for the ninth plan .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production of , traffic in and distribution of drugs , arms and precursors and essential chemicals , which at times places them beyond the reach of the law , corrupting institutions , undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Expressing deep concern at the immense human suffering and loss of life which have accompanied recent crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements , as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems , which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissioner 's crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight ,  
For those States that carried a large burden of foreign debt , structural adjustment programmes forced cuts in basic services and in investments in human development , shifting the responsibilities of basic social services from Governments to women without compensation .  In some developing nations , especially in Africa , the situation was further aggravated by a decline in commodity prices .  
Women , particularly through non-governmental organizations , participated in global , regional , national and community forums and strongly influenced the international debates on environmental management and conservation , human rights , violence against women , population and sustainable development , economic expansion and science and technology .  
Unless women 's human rights , as defined by international conventions and standards , are fully applied , interpreted and enforced in civil , penal and commercial codes and administrative rules and regulations , they will exist only in name .  
Unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women undermine women 's access to full and equal rights .  
Complete national law reviews by 2000 in order to incorporate the principles and provisions of accepted international norms and standards into national legislation and to revoke any remaining discriminatory laws ; ( d ) Provide gender sensitivity and women 's human rights training for all public officials , including law enforcement officers , legal and medical personnel , members of parliament and social workers , so that they may better exercise their public responsibilities ;  
Azerbaijan has repeatedly given tangible proof of its commitment to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and has based its approach to the solution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on the generally accepted international norms of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and respect for human rights .  
Also encourages the above-mentioned organizations to contribute fully to increasing world awareness of the problems and potential of human settlements as important inputs to social progress and economic growth , and world leaders to commit themselves to making cities , towns and villages in their countries healthy , safe , just and sustainable ;  
The main institution officially entrusted with the maintenance of public security is the National Police , which , according to a December 1994 study carried out by a Multinational Commission on Public Security , 2 / is seriously lacking in human and material resources , and is involved chiefly in administrative and protection functions in urban areas .  
With regard to the possibility that special laws or exclusive jurisdictions could be invoked to uphold impunity in respect of human rights violations , a careful study has begun of Guatemalan domestic legislation , with special reference to the military criminal justice system and the identification of cases in which the functioning of this special system could promote impunity .  
Other objectives reached have been : the establishment and regular functioning of bilateral working mechanisms with the Government and URNG ; the signing of agreements on security arrangements with each of the parties ; the establishment of close relations with the competent State organs in the area of human rights ; and permanent , flexible contacts with other human rights bodies and non-governmental organizations .  
The vast majority of cases involving death have not been adequately investigated or resolved by the competent authorities , and this increases levels of impunity , promoting a widespread feeling of insecurity among the public , and makes it more difficult to distinguish violations of the right to life which could be classified as human rights violations from common crimes without a political motive .  
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
These confidence-building measures , which could lead to an informal suspension of offensive military operations , would constitute a demonstration of good will aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population in areas affected by the armed confrontation , protecting human rights and facilitating the work of MINUGUA as well as all national entities devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights . 
The comprehensive agreement is the only agreement that has been in full force and subject to specific verification for almost a year now , yet the current status of compliance with it - the practical expression of which would be a marked improvement in respect for human rights in Guatemala - stands in stark contrast to and falls far short of what was agreed .  
With regard to military operations , until such time as a cease-fire is agreed to and takes effect , URNG insists on the commitment to respect the provisions of the comprehensive agreement on human rights intended to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population , protect human rights and facilitate the work of MINUGUA and of all national bodies devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights and the rights deriving from international humanitarian law .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
In this way , countries are part of coherent synergistic international programmes and networks that not only advance knowledge in the interests of all but also utilize more efficiently scarce human and financial resources , keeping duplication to a minimum .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards : 
Supported by a relatively strong foundation in science and technology and a critical mass of skilled human resources in the field of biological sciences , many countries , especially those in Central and Eastern Europe , can , with appropriate and timely support from the international community , move forward rapidly in biotechnology development and its safe applications .  
Action is urgently needed to facilitate the effective participation of developing countries in the process directed towards adopting realistic and up-to-date standards for intellectual property rights on biotechnology , taking into consideration new advances in and the understanding of biotechnology , as well as its crucial role in sustainable development , its potential impact on human society , and opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration and cooperation .  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Recalling that in the Charter of the United Nations the peoples of the United Nations declared their determination to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples ,  
Recalling also that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights , and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean ,  
Reiterating its profound conviction that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil and political rights and of economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Affirms that a primary aim of international cooperation in the field of human rights is a life of freedom , dignity and peace for all peoples and for every human being , that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interrelated and that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never exempt or excuse States from promoting and protecting the others ;  
Expresses its grave concern at attacks upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto , of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
Noting that , following the cease-fire of 18 July 1994 , a new Government of Rwanda has been established and has made efforts to restore the rule of law and reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , physical , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda after the extensive damage inflicted by the civil conflict ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , stresses the need to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and to the return by refugees and displaced persons to their homes , and welcomes in this regard the commitments made by the Government of Rwanda ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , physical , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to take appropriate steps to ensure adequate financial and human resources and logistical support for the speedy deployment of a sufficient number of human rights field officers and for the delivery of programmes of technical assistance and advisory services ;  
Deeply concerned about the recurring violations of human rights specific to or primarily directed against women by some members of warring factions in Afghanistan , and about the lack of respect towards them and their physical integrity and dignity , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ,  
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .  
Mindful of the dismay and condemnation expressed by the World Conference on Human Rights , held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 , at the continuing occurrence of gross and systematic violations of human rights , including summary and arbitrary executions ,  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , [ 3 ] / and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
Gravely concerned also at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , in particular summary and arbitrary executions , torture , forced labour and forced relocations , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detentions , restrictions on fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of expression and assembly , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Recalling the pertinent resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights condemning the flagrant violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , including its most recent resolution , 1994 / 74 of 9 March 1994 , [ 4 ] / in which the Commission decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a further year and requested him to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session and a final report to the Commission at its fifty-first session ,  
Deeply concerned by the deterioration of the overall human rights situation in Iraq and the continued massive and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , such as summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , enforced or involuntary disappearances , arbitrary arrests and detentions , lack of due process and the rule of law , and of freedom of thought , of expression , of association and of access to food and health care ,  
Deeply concerned further by the increasingly severe and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq against the civilian population in southern Iraq , in particular in the southern marshes , where the combination of massive drainage projects and wide-ranging military operations on the part of the Government of Iraq has forced residents of the marshes to flee in large numbers , many of whom have sought refuge on the border between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran ,  
Also expresses special alarm at the grave violations of human rights in southern Iraq , and urges the Government of Iraq to implement without further delay the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur , including , inter alia , the immediate halting and reversal of the draining of the marshes and the cessation of its military activities against the marsh Arabs , whose survival as a community is endangered ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ;  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by women of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights attaches special importance to the promotion of the equal status and human rights of women .  
The chairpersons stressed that all human rights contained in the international instruments applied fully to women , and that the equal enjoyment of those rights should be closely monitored by each treaty body within the competence of its mandate and that a common strategy should be developed by the treaty bodies in that regard .  
The major areas identified in the Plan are human rights and the promotion of equality ; employment promotion including improving the situation of women in the labour market , women workers in the formal and informal sectors ; training ; working conditions and environment ; social security ; labour legislation , labour relations , labour administration , workers ' and employers ' activities ; women in specific industrial sectors ; and in the different regions .  
The Conference also took a position against violations of the human rights of women in armed conflicts and considered , inter alia , that systematic rape , sexual slavery or forced pregnancy are violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
In many countries , the values of society are still strongly influenced by customary or religious practices and regulations that are sometimes in direct conflict with international human rights standards , as well as with national statutory laws where civil law differs from the customary or religious practices .  
The progress report focused on prerequisites of learning from experience with United Nations peace-keeping operations , and on the status of a ready capacity to act for six substantive components of complex missions : information , electoral , repatriation , human rights , civilian police and military .  
The exceptional cases of the alleged limitations of the human rights and freedoms of individual members of the Albanian national minority in Kosovo and Metohija are the exclusive consequence of the endangering of the constitutional order of the country and the breach of public peace and order through decades-long aggressive activities of the separatist movement in this autonomous province .  
A permanent international criminal court has been eagerly awaited by human rights advocates and Governments alike for more than half a century , and the document prepared by the Commission is a milestone in this direction .  
Undoubtedly the establishment by the Security Council of ad hoc tribunals such as those for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda marks a momentous progress in the fight against human rights abuses and fleshes out the basic demand for international justice as a means of contributing to real and lasting peace in countries torn by armed conflict and beset by large-scale disregard of human dignity .  
Other types of policies are needed for promoting economic growth and trade , changing demographic behaviour , developing human resources , alleviating poverty , promoting the transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound technology and financial resources , and managing natural resources .  
The major common economic characteristic of the poor is that they lack productive assets , either in terms of physical or human capital .  
Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
It is estimated that an amount of $ 100,000 would be required for human rights education and public information in Guatemala to educate and keep the public civic organizations and the mass media , both national and international , informed of the Mission 's activities and findings .  
A society for all is seen as an inclusive society which must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
In view of the evolving mandate of the United Nations in the fields of economic and social development , peace-keeping and peacemaking , human rights and humanitarian assistance , the availability of print materials for public information is an increasingly crucial aspect of the promotion of an informed understanding and effective support for the work of the United Nations .  
As part of its primary responsibility for public information activities built around the World Public Information Campaign for Human Rights and the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights held at Vienna in 1993 , the Department reprinted and distributed essential publications on human rights , including backgrounders on human rights and culture and on indigenous people .  
Decisions regarding the relevance of the proposals in the blueprint and responsibility for taking specific actions would rest with each country , organization or other entity , as appropriate , taking into account the diversity of economic , social , cultural and political conditions , while respecting duly approved international instruments and standards in the field of human rights .  
The possibility of reducing the huge financial , material and human resources devoted to the military sector and reallocating part of them to the civilian sector of national economies has been the object of deliberations within the framework of the United Nations for over three decades .  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ; 
In addition to its introduction and my concluding observations , the report includes seven sections , devoted respectively to military aspects ; public security aspects ; human rights , the judicial system and the Commission on the Truth ; electoral matters ; economic and social issues ; financial aspects ; and administrative aspects .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] : [ - The persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women ;  
Pursue and implement sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies , designed with the full and equal participation of women , that encourage broad-based sustained economic growth [ in the context of people-centred sustainable development ] [ sustainable development centred on human beings ] , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality ;  
A representative of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) emphasized that violence against women was a major public health issue , since it led to psychological trauma , depression , substance abuse , injuries , sexually transmitted diseases , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , suicide and death ; however , the victims rarely received rehabilitative care , or the compensation received by the victims of other injury-causing trauma .  
One organization asserted that this recommendation was unfortunately silent on existing mechanisms for inter-agency meetings on public information issues covering high-priority agenda items such as social and economic development , crime prevention and criminal justice , human rights , environment and sustainable development , women and development , population and refugees .  
Investing in formal and non-formal education and training for girls and women , with its exceptionally high social and economic return , has proved to be one of the best means of achieving [ sustained economic growth and ] [ sustainable development ] [ centred on the human person ] and for eradicating poverty . tertiary education has increased considerably . 
The establishment of an international criminal court to try individuals charged with crimes that pose a threat to international peace and security , violate basic human rights and forcibly subject others to torture in all its forms is a worthy objective sought by the international community .  
In connection with article 6 , paragraph 5 , we are of the view that , in assuring the representation of the principal legal systems of the world , the representation of Islamic penal legislation as a comprehensive and independent system that is rich in human experience and is authoritative for a large number of countries should not be overlooked .  
Within the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) emphasized the relationship between the economic and social aspects of development and the use of resources , considering the environment as a " sink " , absorbing negative impacts of human activities , and as a " source " , providing resource inputs into productive processes or providing final environmental services directly .  
During its special session ( 6-17 February 1995 ) on energy for rural development , the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development noted that adequate energy inputs were required for increased standards of living and productivity of human labour and for income generation in rural areas in developing countries where , on the eve of the twenty-first century , 2.5-billion people still have little or no access to commercial energy supplies and electricity .  
Despite numerous reminders about the Geneva Conventions and calls upon Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue as cited by your report of 22 March 1995 , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims . 
It was appreciated that the report of the Secretary-General on sustainable mountain development ( E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 5 ) , in addition to technical aspects , also covered the social , economic and cultural aspects of human development in mountain areas .  
While we are truly thankful for every single life that has been saved , we must be bitter about all the lives that have not been reached to be rescued and , most critically today , about all the lives that , after three years of systematic human rights abuses , deprivation and sieges , continue to be endangered and subject to the whims of those who have proven their disregard for human life .  
Despite the numerous reminders citing the Geneva Conventions and the calls upon the Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims as is , in fact , pointed out in the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report of 22 March 1995 .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the [ universal ] human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Implement sound macroeconomic and sectoral policies , designed and monitored with the full participation of women , that encourage broad-based sustained economic growth in the context of [ people-centred ] sustainable development [ centred on human beings ] , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality . 
international humanitarian and international human rights instruments to prevent all forms of violence against women in situations of armed and other types of conflict and undertake full investigations of all acts of violence against women committed during war , in particular [ systematic rape ] and sexual slavery , prosecute all criminals responsible for war crimes against women and provide full redress to women victims ;  
At its fiftieth session , the Commission established as the theme topic for its fifty-first session , to be held in April 1995 , " Strengthening regional cooperation in human resources development , with special reference to the social implications of sustainable economic growth in Asia and the Pacific " .  
The 1994 ECA " Economic report " confirms the continued deterioration in social and human conditions and the escalating absolute and relative poverty by pointing out that about 220-million Africans - almost half of the population in sub-Saharan Africa - now live in absolute poverty , unable to meet their most basic needs .  
At the regional and international levels , mechanisms and institutions to promote the advancement of women as an integral part of mainstream political , economic , social and cultural development , and of initiatives on development and human rights , encounter similar problems emanating from a lack of commitment at the highest levels .  
We came to this Summit , rightly called the " People 's Summit " , convinced that the only genuine path towards a new civilization must be one centred on the human person , on the vigour of human dignity and the freedom of the human spirit , and on the inalienable right of the individual to live a full life guaranteed by the existence of universal social justice .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , should enhance the relevance of vocational and technical training to both current and prospective employment conditions by applying a broad and flexible approach to human resources development for youth that fosters the capacity of skilled labour to adjust to changes in labour demand .  
Systematic violation of human rights and freedoms : mass arrests , abductions and murders , pent-up political trials , forcible mobilizations , evictions and ethnic cleansing , plunder , disrespect of religious freedoms , not acknowledging of national and religious institutions of the Bosniac-Moslems .  
As a result of this most irresponsible approach to the fate of their country and its people on the part of the leaders of the armed groups , the peace process in Liberia remains deadlocked : the cease-fire has been broken , and an increase in hostilities has been reported , accompanied by human rights violations on a massive scale .  
At the same time , since ONUSAL will be withdrawing on 30 April 1995 , the Human Rights Division has been emphasizing the urgent need to implement those parts of the peace agreements concerning human rights which are still pending , a matter which is of the utmost importance if El Salvador is to complete the framework of legal and institutional safeguards required in order to achieve democracy and lasting peace .  
The main purpose will be to establish a system of coordination and operation which , within the existing level of institutional management capacity , would lead to better planning and operational management by the United Nations system as a whole , with the result that scarce human and material resources are utilized more appropriately in the provision and coordination of humanitarian assistance in the context of the overall work of the United Nations system .  
The extraordinary ferocity of the war , the physical devastation , the deliberate massacre of civilians and the wanton indifference to human suffering have continued unabated for three years now .  
Taking into account the main development objectives established by the Territory 's Executive Council , namely , the improved management of the economy through a more efficient public sector , the strategic development of human resources through the reform of the educational and training systems , and the development of integrated policies of physical infrastructural improvements , as well as the preservation of the natural environment ,  
The subprogramme will address the need to protect the atmospheric environment from adverse change induced by human intervention and the requirement for accurate and timely assessments of the impact of climate variability and change on socio-economic systems ; ozone layer depletion and its effects ; and ambient air quality .  
ACC noted that while issues relating to economic reforms and growth were being pursued with vigour and financial support , mainly from the Bretton Woods institutions , the pursuit of the social and environmental dimensions of development , including the protection of human rights , was lagging , owing to a lack of adequate resources and a proper appreciation of the linkages among the various dimensions of development .  
An international symposium on sources of innovation in multilateralism was held , in cooperation with the University of Lausanne , Switzerland , in May to re-examine the nature of global changes and the challenges posed to the United Nations , including its reform proposals , as well as emerging new social forces such as women 's movements , endogenous peoples , human rights activists and others . 
The symposium , held in April and attended by more than 300 scholars , diplomats , NGO representatives , religious leaders , and journalists , addressed issues of peace and security , development , environment , and shared universal human values and norms that go beyond the concept of international cooperation in the " global neighbourhood " .  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
A second programme : " Applications of biotechnology for development " is presently a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life . 
The sectoral advisory services cover programmes relating to human rights , global development issues and policies , energy , human settlements , trade and development , population , natural resources , social development , public administration and finance , crime prevention and criminal justice , statistics and emergency humanitarian assistance .  
These activities include basic statistical and methodological work in national accounts , international merchandise trade , commodity production , energy , population and human settlements , the environment , prices , the role of women , social indicators and special population groups , and general integrated databases .  
In this context , technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments will seek to ensure an integrated and effective approach to economic and social development within the framework of the overall economic and social development priorities , policies and plans of the developing countries and within the orientations of sustainable human development , as well as , where appropriate , within the context of the peace-to-development continuum .  
The exercise analysed the current state of human development in the countries and identified broad development strategies that take into account the specific socio-economic characteristics , fragile ecosystems and limited natural resource base of these island economies .  
As a result , the Governments of Belarus , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Lithuania , Poland , the Russian Federation and the Slovak Republic have requested UNDP and ILO to assist them in the development of institutions and human resources , and the strengthening of various skills such as managerial , educational , entrepreneurial , human and institutional structures at the local level .  
In an era of financial stringency , the limited resources available to assist developing countries must be directed prudently towards those investments with the highest payoff ; experience in country after country demonstrates that water and sanitation improvements are vital to economic progress and , more broadly , provide the very foundations for sustainable human development .  
Welcomes the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ;  
At the same time , the practical activities of IAEA in implementing the safeguards should not hamper scientific and technical development or international cooperation by States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and should be based on optimum utilization of the Agency 's human and material resources .  
Article 1 ( c ) of the ECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents refers to the adverse consequences of industrial accidents on " ( i ) human beings , flora and fauna ; ( ii ) soil , water , air and landscape ; ( iii ) the interaction between the factors in ( i ) and ( ii ) ; material assets and cultural heritage , including historical monuments " .  
This latter definition is the real meaning of " intrinsic " as used in these legal instruments , and in any case the words " essential " and " inherent " do not mean that the adverse effects on the environment per se constitute a form of harm which is independent of human beings .  
The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
From activities scattered over a wide spectrum of disparate fields in the form of a plethora of relatively small projects , UNDP has moved steadily to concentrate its scarce human and financial resources on a small number of priority thematic goals .  
Executive Board decision 94 / 14 synthesized and built on a decade of gradual reform , 1 / providing UNDP with the three principal goals of ( a ) strengthening international cooperation for sustainable human development ; ( b ) helping the United Nations family to become a unified and powerful force for human development ; and ( c ) focusing UNDP resources on making the maximum contribution in its programme countries to key SHD dimensions .  
In the Seychelles , the national human resource development programme has as its objective increasing labour productivity through the creation of an enabling environment and incentives to the private sector and through reforms leading to greater capacity and increased efficiency in the public sector .  
The envisaged cooperation aims at supporting efforts of the member States of the two organizations to promote regional cooperation and sustainable human development through programmes and activities designed to mobilize and enhance human resources , to promote the environmentally sound use of natural and mineral resources and raise the living standards of the peoples in the countries concerned .  
Particularly in recommendation 9 , it has stressed the urgent need to gather data and disaggregated information on a gender basis , in a comprehensive and integrated manner , at the international , regional , national and local levels with a view to assessing the current reality of women , identifying persistent problems and challenging the invisibility of women 's human rights .  
That community must reaffirm that the human rights of women form an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and that the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international level , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex , are priority objectives of the international community .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
The World Summit for Social Development was remarkable in its scope : it gave a comprehensive meaning to social development , encompassing the functioning of society and all institutions for the overall objective of the betterment of the human condition and it placed people at the centre of all concerns and policies for sustainable development , proclaiming that all human beings are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with the environment .  
The Counsel for Human Rights expressed concern at the increase in political and social violence and the ineffectiveness of the State institutions responsible for investigating and punishing human rights violations , and pointed to the many unsolved cases of extrajudicial execution .  
Consequently , in the Agreement , URNG undertook " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " and , like the Government , it recognized the need to end the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants . 
During the period covered by this report , the Mission verified complaints of alleged violations by both parties of the commitment to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , as well as to end the suffering of the civilian population .  
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
The Committee was also informed that the distribution of resources had been guided by the priority areas as identified in the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised , 2 / and also by those reflected in the budget outline , namely , political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal oversight .  
Despite the constant attention devoted to this issue by a number of international and human rights organizations , and notwithstanding various statements from the Estonian authorities about their good intentions , legislative and administrative norms which basically discriminate against the Russian-speaking population are being reinforced and enacted into law in the country .  
The Acting Director emphasized that that situation limited the Institute 's capacity to provide the corresponding General Assembly committees with substantive contributions and research findings in critical areas of economic and social development processes , such as : water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , poverty alleviation , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
There is no doubt , as we indicated in our previous letter , that the Iraqi regime is unaware of the scale of the human suffering caused by the illegal imprisonment of the Kuwaiti and other prisoners because that regime is itself responsible for the suffering of its own people , about which it is totally unconcerned , as is proved by the following facts :  
Social justice at the national and international levels is an imperative , for only under an elevated form of social justice can the full potential of human resources development be realized .  
" human resources development is a broad concept . . . requiring integrated and concerted strategies , policies , plans and programmes to ensure the development of the full potential of human beings . . . so that they may , individually and collectively , be capable of improving their standard of living " .  
The second model , the information initiative approach , requires a series of basic steps that generate high quality of information , which then can be utilized to identify ( a ) shortcomings in the current human resources capacities of the public sector ; ( b ) types of professional development programmes needed in order to upgrade the quality of the staff ; and ( c ) the knowledge and skills needed for those who will be recruited into the public sector .  
The increased importance of transparency in the transfer and possession of conventional arms and the growing international interest in such transparency are justified by the fact that such weapons are virtually untouched by existing legislation and can cause serious human suffering .  
" Despite all our technological breakthroughs , we still live in a world where a fifth of the developing world 's population goes hungry every night , a quarter lacks access to even a basic necessity like safe drinking water , and a third lives in a state of abject poverty - at such a margin of human existence that words simply fail to describe it .  
It is possible clearly to visualize the possibility of identifying , within a social network , joint projects in such critical areas as , for example , the production of strategic information , the cooperative search for financing sources and collective negotiation of financing , the training of specialized human resources and the setting of quality standards in the evaluation of social programmes .  
Those who not only advocate but brutally carry out the policy of ethnic cleansing , national and religious superiority and the physical elimination of a people combined with the destruction of the traces of their centuries-old existence and the expropriation of their land and all other belongings , must not be treated in the same way as those who fight for religious equality , tolerance , coexistence , human rights and freedom .  
As if the Indonesian authorities were taking revenge for the restraint they had had to exercise before the international press correspondents gathered in Jakarta and Dili for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council ( APEC ) summit meeting held last November , East Timor has been swept since that occasion by a wave of new repressive and intimidating actions , leading to a serious deterioration of the human rights situation .  
This year , the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations which coincides with the twentieth anniversary of the illegal invasion of East Timor the question of East Timor is increasingly attracting worldwide attention , not only as a basic human rights issue but also , first and foremost , as a question of restoring the rights of a small colonial people , allowing it freely to choose its future political status .  
Economic and social development , democratic consolidation and the promotion and protection of human rights all require a strong , rational and predictable legal system for their effective implementation .  
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
In the short time that has elapsed since the Esquipulas I agreement , Central Americans have almost completely succeeded in containing the political violence that had ravaged several countries in the region ; democracies have been established and transformed ; respect for human rights has been strengthened , and the new regional integration system has been defined . "  
In addition , it could serve as a mechanism for political dialogue among the participating States in order to define common principles and interests with respect to both their internal stability ( State subject to the rule of law , human rights ) and external stability ( fundamental principles of good-neighbourliness among States , including general security questions ) .  
That high level of attrition at a stage when continuing learning is both optimal and desirable represents , from an educational and manpower planning perspective , a wasted national opportunity to expand and strengthen the human resource pool for the enhancement of national productivity .  
Furthermore , all the reports prepared in connection with acts of violence that have swept through the country since then indicate that serious , systematic and widespread violations of human rights have been committed and that international law has been violated .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The mandate included the following : all violations of human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , and in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; all forms of sexual harassment , exploitation and trafficking in women ; the elimination of gender bias in the administration of justice ; and the eradication of harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices , cultural prejudice and religious extremism . 
The guidelines suggest numerous preventive measures that may be taken such as practical improvements in camp organization , location and design ; human resources management measures including the hiring of more female staff ; measures aimed at encouraging the host Government to take effective legal and other action ; and preventive measures involving education and training .  
The 1994 World Development Report of the World Bank has documented substantial intra-national differences in performance between key infrastructural sectors critical to sustaining social development .  20 / The " human " aspects of sustained economic development are now considered central to successful social progress as specified in the documentation surrounding the preparation for , and completion of the World Summit .  
Sustenance of human resources through the necessary statutory , regulatory , legislative and participatory governance mechanisms that express the ongoing social will to support human resource development ;  
Ensuring the backstopping of essential human freedoms such as acceptably peaceful and equitable political , economic and social environments that promote individual , local and national security .  
In particular , better understanding is beginning to emerge of linkages between the supply process on the one hand ( population , education , health ) , and the diverse and dynamic activity of fluctuating demand for human resources ( in public and private sector employing establishments , as well as self-employment and a growing variety of less formal ways of making a living ) on the other .  
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
UNIDO offers a demand-oriented , integrated human resource development programme in three primary areas interlocking at three levels of support intervention : ( a ) policy advice based on analysis and assessment of requirements ; ( b ) institutional capacity-building and catalytic learning systems , including training , at subsector levels and in specialized fields ; and ( c ) communication networks to facilitate coordination and synergy of efforts .  
To be effective , intervention in this cycle must be multisectoral and comprehensive , and where possible focused on and supportive of the family / household as the critical socio-economic and cultural unit for sustainable human development .  
A strategy for transformation of education and training institutions is proposed , which reduces their isolation from the cutting edges of scientific and technological change , improves articulation between the supply of and demand for human resources through better understanding of systems of production , and acknowledges the crucial intersectoral links between the economy and society at both individual and collective levels .  
Major changes have included strengthening the overarching theoretical framework to identify and refine its major human resource development components more clearly , a narrowing of focus to key practical and high-priority activities , and updating implementing arrangements to reflect changing regional circumstances .  
In assessing costs for example of human resource development investments , the family decision-making structure will take into account inhibiting as well as motivating factors affecting their decisions to invest time in the schooling of girls , the opportunity costs of lost household or other ( e.g . agricultural , smallholding or commercial ) labour , or cultural / psychological stress on individuals as a consequence of non-traditional occupational or " career " choices .  
In paragraph 12 ( g ) , making economic growth and the interaction of market forces more conducive to social development requires " ensuring substantial public and private investment in human resource development and in capacity-building in health and education , as well as in empowerment and participation , especially for people living in poverty or suffering from social exclusion " .  
Paragraph 40 ( c ) of chapter II , section D , on enhanced social protection , points to the potential resourcefulness of older persons , suggesting that particular efforts should be made towards " ensuring that older persons are able to meet their basic human needs through access to social services and social security , that those in need are assisted , that older persons are protected from abuse and violence and are treated as a resource and not a burden " .  
The United Nations system can support these regional efforts , both by improving linkages , in terms of direct relevance , down to country strategies , as well as providing global communication of the commonalities and differences across regions , thus providing useful contextual and comparative information to those charged with human resource development planning .  
Its main functions include : ( a ) processing the dissemination of human rights as an effective means of guaranteeing their observance and consolidating the democratic system , ( b ) cooperating with relevant institutions to promote the teaching of human rights at the primary , secondary and university levels and in non-formal education and ( c ) promoting the alignment of domestic legislation with international agreements and treaties on human rights .  
It is important to demonstrate that surviving internal resources - physical , financial and human ( including displaced professionals ) are being drawn on to the maximum extent possible and geared to the rebuilding of the country .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
We call upon the authorities in Zagreb to hold inviolate the civil and human rights of the local Serb population and to treat all prisoners of war in accordance with accepted standards of international law governing the rights of military personnel in conflict situations .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
The Government of the Republic of Croatia is concerned that the magnitude of the human rights abuses against ethnic Croats in the " Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) " as well as in the remaining occupied territories of Croatia and in the parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by Serbs will increase and that this can only raise tensions and hinder the establishment of a lasting peace in the region .  
[ They are often subjected to [ various forms of ] sexual and economic exploitation , [ paedophilia , prostitution , forced prostitution and trafficking in human organs and tissues ] , violence and harmful practices such as [ prenatal sex selection foeticide ] infanticide , incest , female genital mutilation and [ forced ] early marriage . ] "  Paragraph 44 , last sentence .  
Overly complex administrative procedures , lack of awareness within the judicial process and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of all women , coupled with the underrepresentation of women in justice systems , insufficient information on existing rights and persistent attitudes and practices , perpetuate women 's de facto inequality . ]  
" [ All forms of gender-based violence , including those resulting from all forms of sexual harassment , prostitution , pornography , sexual slavery and exploitation , including those violations resulting from cultural prejudice , racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia , ethnic cleansing , religious and anti-religious extremism and international trafficking in women and children , are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and must be eliminated . ] "  Fifth sentence .  
" The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made at the meeting of the States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
However , even according to sparse reports of the relevant organizations , including the United Nations , it is more than evident that the atrocities of the Croatian army were abundant - indiscriminate shelling of columns of refugees , total destruction of entire Serb villages , looting and gross violations of human rights .  
Indeed , discussion of the issue has never been so extensive : the chairpersons stressed that all human rights contained in the international instruments applied fully to women ; that the equal enjoyment of those rights should be closely monitored by each treaty body within the competence of its mandate ; and that a common strategy should be developed by the treaty bodies in that regard .  
Their recommendations are largely general rather than focused on specific rights : it has generally been felt necessary and urgent to call for the respect of the non-discrimination principle , the conformity of national legislation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , accession to international human rights instruments , the elimination of discriminatory practices and the abrogation of laws that discriminate against women . 
The Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) , adopted by the General Assembly in 1989 and since ratified by 177 States , is an international instrument that promotes and protects the human rights of children in different areas ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ) .  
Intensify and coordinate international support for education and health programmes based on respect for human dignity and focused on the protection of all women and children , especially against exploitation , trafficking and harmful practices , such as child prostitution , female genital mutilation and child marriages . "  
In this regard , Earthwatch is exploring the potential to use schools , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , the media and other groups in building a more complete picture of the status of species , land uses , development activities , pollution problems and other characteristics of the human and natural environment as inputs for state-of-the-environment reporting and as a basis for selective continued monitoring of national and global trends and for filling data gaps .  
It should be noted that , had the total estimated requirement for substantive activities been approved , including training and human resources development , information and documentation services , joint activities and advisory services amounting to $ 434,858.44 , the budgetary distribution in the form of percentages of both administrative expenditure and substantive services would have been meaningful and well distributed .  
The Working Group also noted that these workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including forcing them to live separately from their spouse and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and strongly condemned practices of unequal treatment of migrant workers and the denial to them of minimum human consideration and dignity .  
While mercenaries are typically present in situations of armed conflict , it would be incorrect to limit the description to those cases alone , since it applies to any situation in which the sovereignty of States , the self-determination of peoples , political stability and the human rights of populations are affected in a premeditated fashion by operations in which the active agent is a foreign mercenary specially hired to carry out unlawful criminal acts .  
The content of the reports was similar to that of others reviewed by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and by the thematic rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights on the right to life and the physical integrity of persons , as well as by other United Nations organs and agencies that are attempting to devise a peaceful , just and lasting solution to the conflict and that are engaged in human rights or humanitarian relief activities .  
The presence of foreigners and alleged mercenaries in the 1991 war in Croatia and in the war in progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1992 coincided with serious violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights of the peoples affected , and psychological warfare played a fundamental role in the development of the armed conflict . 
This has facilitated the monitoring of borders , coastlines , territorial and international waters , space and natural resources by means of powerful , ultra-precise radar networks , instead of by land , sea and air patrols , thereby freeing up human , material and temporal resources so as to secure borders against enemy infiltration and guaranteeing the repulsion of any violation of the integrity , security and stability of States or entire regions .  
Total arms expenditure , including money spent on developing advanced technologies for military purposes , has absorbed considerable human , material and financial resources .  
The United Nations system continues to play an important role in many traditional areas of operational activities in several countries : nearly all developing countries cited technical and technological assistance , social development , poverty alleviation , health and education , and the improvement of human resources as continuing priorities for the United Nations system .  
My delegation is confident that a termination of the brutal hostilities and human carnage that Rwanda has endured for a good part of this century can most effectively be pursued through political means that emphasize peaceful solutions while being cognizant of the regional dimensions of the issues that confront Rwanda and impact its internal and external security .  
Cooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
A seminar was held in Indonesia ( December 1994 ) which identified concrete opportunities for Asian-African cooperation in such areas as improved agricultural productivity , human capital formation and institutional development .  
In view of the above , the XXth Postal Congress launched an appeal to Governments to provide the postal service with a statute and a modern management system that would guarantee it proper autonomy and adequate human and financial resources based on the notion of profitability .  
For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
However , in an increasing number of developing countries , with the accumulation of physical and human capital , technology and management know-how , the domestic base for more sophisticated services is being developed . 
At the regional and international levels , mechanisms and institutions to promote the advancement of women as an integral part of mainstream political , economic , social and cultural development , and of initiatives on development and human rights , encounter similar problems emanating from a lack of commitment at the highest levels .  
The Platform for Action reaffirms that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development - are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , as expressed in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights .  
Unless the human rights of women , as defined by international human rights instruments , are fully recognized and effectively protected , applied , implemented and enforced in national law as well as in national practice in family , civil , penal , labour and commercial codes and administrative rules and regulations , they will exist in name only .  
Overly complex administrative procedures , lack of awareness within the judicial process and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of all women , coupled with the underrepresentation of women in justice systems , insufficient information on existing rights and persistent attitudes and practices perpetuate women 's de facto inequality .  
Review national laws , including customary laws and legal practices in the areas of family , civil , penal , labour and commercial law in order to ensure the implementation of the principles and procedures of all relevant international human rights instruments by means of national legislation , and revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in the administration of justice ;  
Include information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected ;  
The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made by the meeting of States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] :  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
Considering that the ultimate purpose of the State is none other than to create more equitable societies in which all members can realize their full human potential in terms of the material satisfaction of their basic needs and their intellectual and spiritual development in conditions of freedom , dignity , equality of opportunity and full respect for fundamental human rights ,  
It requested States and relevant international organizations to coordinate their law enforcement activities and otherwise cooperate to pursue those engaged in the smuggling and transport of such human cargo ; to provide technical assistance to countries in developing and implementing policies to prevent and criminalize clandestine traffic in illegal migrants , and to punish its organizers , enhancing the professional skills of the personnel concerned .  
With regard to item 114 ( b ) of the draft agenda ( Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms ) , the Secretary-General wishes to recall resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 whereby the General Assembly , inter alia , decided to mark the end of the United Nations Year for Tolerance at a special commemorative plenary meeting of its fiftieth session .  
Massive violations of human rights , especially in the form of genocide , " ethnic cleansing " as a strategy of war and its consequences , rape , including systematic rape of women in war situations , creating mass exodus of refugees and displaced persons , are abhorrent practices that are strongly condemned and must be immediately stopped , while perpetrators of such crimes must be punished .  
The Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice .  
The humanitarian situation , which is particularly difficult , the observance of human rights , which can neither be renounced nor evaded , and the capacity of the local police to be effective , impartial and professional , are all important issues which must be addressed , on a priority basis , and for which we will also support efforts to show the commitment and the support of the international community .  
In their search for new opportunities and markets , organized criminal groups were ready to make sizeable investments in both equipment and human resources and were willing to bring their huge financial power to bear , in addition to using other more violent methods , for eliminating competition .  
The Government of Iraq noted that , in believing firmly in the right of States to the exercise of complete sovereignty and equality and respect for human rights , it strongly opposes the use by some developed countries of arbitrary economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against the peoples of the world with the aim of humiliating them and depriving them of their basic right to development and economic well-being .  
The Government of Iraq stresses that the coercive economic measures taken by some developed countries against developing countries constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law , the principles of human rights and the divine prescriptions of religious law .  
The use of unilateral coercive economic measures as a means of exercising political and economic pressure against developing countries constitutes a grave violation of the human rights of individuals , groups and people recognized in the Charter of the United Nations and in all international human rights instruments . 
A key component of its work is to see to it that national institutions play an effective role in the promotion and protection of human rights at the national level and forge close links with international bodies pursuing the same goal .  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .  
ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .  
Implicit in this approach is that women 's ability to compensate at the household level for the decline in output and for changes in the composition and level of aggregate demand is treated as infinitely elastic , obscuring the impact of macroeconomic policy on the human resource base of economic activity .  
This in turn is likely to have a negative impact on international economic competitiveness , balance of payments and economic growth , as the shortfall in human skills resulting from the adverse impact of macroeconomic policy remains unaccounted for and unplanned for in terms of appropriate supportive measures and resources , thus rendering the policy unsustainable .  
The complete embargo which has been imposed on the people of Iraq for the last five years , depriving the Iraqi people , including women , children and elderly , of their most basic legitimate right , which is the right to life , is not considered as a violation of human rights , since it was the wish of the forces hostile to Iraq , with which Mr . van der Stoel is cooperating .  
The Government of Iraq , guided by paragraph 31 of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights , which states that food and medicine should not be used as a tool for political pressure , looks to the United Nations and its humanitarian organizations to study the grave political , legal and humanitarian consequences of the imposition of the economic embargo , requesting that a mechanism should be sought to minimize those consequences and their dangerous repercussions on all human rights . 
It is clear to any impartial observer of the manner in which the Special Rapporteur deals with the human rights situation in Iraq and his activity in this area that Iraq 's position on him is correct and why Iraq accuses him of bias and lack of objectivity and of being an instrument for the implementation of the schemes of States and parties hostile to Iraq that aim at overthrowing its national regime , rending asunder its territory and fragmenting its population .  
Although true , Mr . van der Stoel 's words are intentionally misleading in that he claims to feel sorry for the children of Iraq , yet at the same time fails to request the lifting of the embargo against them ; on the contrary , he holds the Government of Iraq responsible for such human suffering on account of its non-implementation of Security Council resolutions 706 ( 1991 ) and 712 ( 1991 ) , despite being satisfied as to their political objectives .  
The mass media must also be mobilized with the support of non-governmental organizations , at the level of both States and regional organizations , in order to ensure the periodic dissemination of human rights information .  In addition , greater efforts must be made by the mass media to avoid propagating racist prejudice and stereotypes and to help the general public to form responsible critical opinions on the increasingly tragic events which tend to be trivialized in some circles .  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .

The United Nations symbolizes the constant aspiration of men who , with a vision of the future , enshrined in the Preamble of the Charter the purpose of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war ; reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human being , and embodied among its purposes the maintenance of international peace and security . 
We must assume the historic commitment to accept the challenge and to devote ourselves with enthusiasm to the shaping of a new world , which will do away with political , religious and racial intolerance , which will eliminate inequality and social backwardness , which will establish human fraternity and solidarity , a new world in which the beacon of freedom and democracy will light its path . 
Today , we recall that almost visionary determination , and we are fortunate to do so in an organization that is vibrant with issues to address and problems to solve , and that is deeply involved in finding solutions to major international crises and increasingly committed to economic development , human rights and social and environmental problems .  
They called for the speedy establishment of a permanent international criminal court that would prosecute perpetrators of massive violations of human rights , including perpetrators of egregious acts of racial discrimination .  
NULLIn its resolution 1995 / 52 of 3 March 1995 on the situation of human rights in Togo , the Commission , inter alia , welcomed the fact that Togo had set out on the road to democratic political change , and urged all Togolese to respect the outcome of the parliamentary elections held in February 1994 and to ensure the effective functioning of the democratically elected parliament .  
Department staff held meetings with the senior representatives of the League to discuss joint actions to organize a regional seminar on a new integrated approach for sustainable human development : spatial / sectoral development strategy for Arab countries .  
NULLWithin the framework of the ILO / ALO joint programme agreed upon at the beginning of 1994 , five Arab regional seminars / expert group meetings were organized on the following topics : employment and labour market policies ; small enterprises development ( for employers ' organizations ) ; employment and labour market programmes in the context of sustainable human development ; and Arab and international labour standards .  
NULLCooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the League of Arab States continued during 1994-1995 in technical fields of mutual interest in the areas of agriculture and rural development , natural resources and environment protection , human resources training and global economic and social development .  
NULLThe Programme of Work had divided the remaining accords into six areas ( public security , land transfer , human settlements , reintegration programmes , Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and Disabled and legislative reforms ) and established dates by which specific provisions in each area must be completed .  
The employment-generating capacity of growth can be enhanced by investing in the more labour-intensive sectors of the economy , especially agriculture ; by increasing investments in human capital , i.e . , basic education , primary health care , nutrition and population programmes ; and by reducing or removing distortions in relative factor prices that arise from a malfunctioning of the labour market or of the market for credit . 
However , the coexistence of different groups is not always peaceful , and problems relating to minorities are today one of the major sources of international and internal conflicts involving widespread and at times massive human rights violations with severe repercussions for the peace and stability of the community of nations .  
In this multidimensional context , the question of the protection and promotion of the human rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities is of overriding importance for the respect of human rights generally and central to the promotion of understanding , tolerance and solidarity between and among communities and Governments .  
NULLIn a number of cases , special rapporteurs appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries and on thematic issues have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
NULLPursuant to General Assembly resolution 36 / 151 , voluntary contributions to the Fund from Governments , non-governmental organizations and private individuals are to be distributed through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of torture and to relatives of such victims .  
It is administered , in accordance with the Financial Regulations of the United Nations , by the Secretary-General , assisted by a Board of Trustees composed of five members who possess wide experience in the field of human rights , serve in a personal capacity and are appointed by the Secretary-General for a renewable three-year term of office on the basis of equitable geographical distribution and in consultation with their Governments .  
NULLThe programme of work had divided the remaining accords into six areas ( public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and Disabled , and legislative reforms ) and established dates by which specific provisions in each area must be completed .  
Besides the introduction and my concluding observations , the report is divided into six sections , related to : public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative aspects .  
The complex social and political circumstances of the rural human settlements indicates that the transfer of their productive , social and habitational infrastructure will remain an issue of particular delicacy , with a potential for aggravated social tension within the regions where they are situated .  
It was also agreed that funds reserved for the civilian component of the Mission should be increased to enable it to deploy constitutional legal experts , human rights monitors and mediators , and to facilitate the process of dialogue and national reconciliation in Burundi .  
The alleged perpetrators include clandestine organizations which , while claiming to be fighting against crime and impunity , have been responsible for threats of this kind , have thwarted investigations of crimes against human rights , caused the resignation of public prosecutors in high-profile cases and intimidated relatives and prospective new victims . 
NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
NULLThe process of investigating individual cases takes into account the rights of indigenous peoples as set forth in the Guatemalan Constitution and in international human rights instruments to which Guatemala is a party , particularly the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , and therefore emphasizes discrimination with respect to cultural , civil and political rights .  
NULLCooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
Promotion of effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
The United Nations General Assembly , by its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , considering , inter alia , that the promotion and the protection of all human rights is one of the priorities of the international community , and aware that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , decided to create the post of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights .  
NULLIn the meantime , human suffering of considerable gravity persists in the form of murder , disappearances and infliction of conditions that cause physical destruction , thus depriving people of fundamental human rights such as the right to life , the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .  
Factors such as deprivation of education , limited meaningful human contact and easy access to sophisticated weapons , coupled with the experience of the cruelties of war , destroy the value system of many young people , resulting in a failure to discourage them from participating in violent activities .  
Since the fall of KNU bases at Manerplaw in January 1995 and following the split in KNU in December 1994 , several reliable sources have reported that DKBO has committed widespread human rights abuses , e.g . , reprisals against civilians following insurgent ambushes , looting and forced relocations .  
NULLIt is worth noting that during the past two years the Government of the Sudan in its extensive written replies to the Special Rapporteur 's reports did not put forward one single argument supporting the consistency of the analysed provisions of its State legislation with applicable international human rights norms and standards .  
The Special Rapporteur believes that the racial dimension of the violations and abuses against children living in northern Sudan , or , in the case of children in southern Sudan , those who are abducted and sold into slavery constitutes a particularly grave and alarming circumstance , which should be of particular concern from a human rights perspective .  
In practical terms , the campaign against racism and xenophobia must be carried out by developing educational programmes , punishing those responsible for such practices , opening up new opportunities for members of racial and ethnic minorities and ensuring , at all levels , respect for human dignity .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
Assistance to human resources development totalled $ 64-million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Throughout 1995 , field officers have continued to travel from commune to commune meeting with civil , judicial and military authorities and local populations to learn about the general conditions of each commune , including security , access to property , the material needs and the functioning of the judiciary , conditions of detention centres and alleged human rights violations .  
The main purpose of the definition is not to create a new category of persons having special rights , but to ensure that protections recognized as the rights of persons in certain situations are extended to others in analogous situations and thereby promote a more harmonious and coherent approach to human rights .  
If , however , the country is unable or unwilling to meet the minimum standards required by humanitarian or human rights law , then these guarantees may have to be met through international assistance .  
As such , the programme has been unable to provide any substantial financial assistance to meet capital assistance needs which have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries which are committed to these ends but which face economic hardship due to economic problems , crisis or transition .  
While , for example , the value of training prison guards in human rights standards and techniques and providing expert assistance in the drafting of humane prison regulations remain clear priorities of the programme , such inputs lose substantial potential for positive impact if the guards , however well trained , and the regulations , however humane , are set in the context of substandard facilities and inhumane physical conditions .  
Such support might be facilitated by , inter alia , the substantial supplementing of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights ; the establishment of a separate , complementary fund for capital assistance in the field of human rights ; or encouraging increased support from development agencies and funds and financial institutions for financial and capital assistance for human rights and the rule of law .  
NULLIn recent years , the frequency and magnitude of major disasters , whether of a natural , technological or ecological origin , have made the world community aware of the immense loss of human life and economic resources that are regularly caused by such calamities .  
Accordingly , special attention had been paid to strengthening the Organization 's capacity to deal with political and peace-keeping activities , reinforcing international and regional cooperation for development , enhancing support for human rights and humanitarian activities , and increasing internal oversight capacity .  
NULLThe estimates relating to human resources covered staff on permanent and fixed-term contracts , temporary staff hired for varying durations of time , consultants , contractual personnel and expert groups .  
NULLWhile the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
During 1995 , the UNICEF Regional Office continued to work with the secretariat in developing analytical materials on major issues affecting southern African children , including human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and is exploring possible collaboration with the human resource development sector in the area of basic education .  
His delegation was therefore pleased that the Commission had decided to refer to the Drafting Committee only the articles concerned with aggression , genocide , systematic or mass violations of human rights , and exceptionally serious war crimes ; that decision demonstrated that the Commission was directing its work towards a realistic , rather than a political concept of crimes against the peace and security of mankind .  
Consequently , the United States could not accept the Human Rights Committee 's views in its General Comment No . 24 ( 52 ) , since it did not believe that the classic rules on reservations were inadequate for human rights treaties .  On the contrary , they had helped to advance the fundamental objective of broad participation by States .  
It should be obvious from the above that the Greek Cypriots are among the least qualified people to talk of respect for " human rights " when successive reports of the Secretary-General and international press reports attest to the fact that during the period 1963-1974 there was a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people by the Greek Cypriot side .  
They noted that this dangerous situation has led to tremendous losses in human lives , considerable material damage and unspeakable suffering among the population , including the massive movement of refugees .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
It involves the transmission of knowledge and the affirmation of values that emphasize peaceful coexistence , responsibility , tolerance , solidarity and justice and that promote the development of individuals who show social solidarity and who are active and tolerant in the political sphere , productive in the economic sphere , respectful of human rights and aware of the value of the natural environment .  
That a key element of reform is the selection of members with the requisite technical skills and broad managerial capabilities to enable the Commission to take bold initiatives to keep pace with global trends in human resources management and the changing needs of the organizations .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
If the level of women 's representation of between 30 and 35 per cent and above is considered to form a critical mass , the Secretariat can be considered to have achieved that status in such occupational groups as political affairs , legal affairs , public information , administration , social affairs , economic affairs , human resources and human rights .  
The High Commissioner also sought support for establishing national committees for human rights education , as focal points for Decade activities ; he asked that achievable goals be set and that the intellectual and material resources necessary to reach them be provided .  
It also welcomed the call in the Plan of Action for more systematic coordination among specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions and NGOs , and the assignment of that responsibility to the High Commissioner ; coordinated international action in the area of human rights education would result in more effective assistance to individual countries without weakening their sense of " ownership " of curricula reforms .  
The Committee was not provided with adequate justification for the posts being requested in relation to the programme of work for the completion of all outstanding areas of the peace accords mentioned in paragraph 3 ( i.e . , public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , protection of the wounded and disabled and legislative reform ) .  
Among the key issues which should be addressed were poverty eradication , global macroeconomic policy coordination , industrial development , economic diversification and the development of infrastructures , improved resource flows , including debt relief ; commodities policy ; human resource development and capacity-building .  
During the preceding six years his country had irreversibly embarked on the road to democracy , the rule of law and the protection of universal human rights and it attached the utmost importance to matters relating to minorities , a basic prerequisite for building a genuine democracy that would contribute to regional and international security and cooperation .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Welcomes the ongoing peace efforts and notes with satisfaction that fundamental humanitarian and human rights principles are to be included in the comprehensive peace agreements as indispensable elements to achieve a lasting peace ;  
The continued gross violations of human rights , the ethnic cleansing and the forcible return of refugees and displaced persons underline the importance of a firm commitment by all parties to human rights and humanitarian principles , and of international monitoring to ensure their compliance .  
International legal and related efforts in the field of environment continue to see rapid development , constituting a substantial framework of legal , administrative , economic , financial and technical measures to prevent , control and reduce the adverse impact of human activities on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems .  
His delegation therefore considered that the Commission 's decision to link the notion of proportionality to the regime of prohibited countermeasures envisaged in part two , article 14 was correct , but felt that it was inappropriate to prohibit any conduct which derogated from basic human rights , since neither the text nor the commentary indicated specific criteria for determining which human rights were " basic " .  
With regard to the new text of draft article 21 , Slovenia felt that the original intention to include in a single group both crimes against humanity as recognized by customary law on the basis of the Charter of the N \ x { e16c } nberg Tribunal , which applied only in time of war , and systematic and massive violations of human rights , represented an attempt to further the progressive development of international law .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
The coordination of human rights activities throughout the United Nations system was the subject of debate in the framework of the coordination segment of the Economic and Social Council ( 26-30 June 1995 ) which had on its agenda coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields . 
In line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , measures are being taken to make the human rights machinery : ( a ) more effective and cost efficient ; ( b ) able to act swiftly and to respond appropriately to human rights situations ; ( c ) stronger , through international cooperation in the field of human rights , based on mutual confidence ; and ( d ) more transparent and understandable to the outside world .  
The main focus of the country programmes , as determined during the missions , will be on the strategic management of industrial development , human resources development , quality control and standardization , the environment , private sector development , with emphasis on small and medium industries , and the implications of the Uruguay Round agreements for the industrialization of Africa .  
It was necessary to acknowledge once and for all that atomic radiation was capable of causing considerable damage , but such damage could take on catastrophic proportions in small States and manifest itself in heavy loss of human life and industrial and economic collapse .  
During the last half of March 1995 , a high-level team of three experts , including specialists in architectural , construction management , project scheduling , human resource monitoring and time extension analysis , accompanied by a representative of senior management from Headquarters , travelled to Addis Ababa to review and evaluate the situation , and to establish a course of action to ensure the timely completion of the project .  
The Croatian aggression resulted in major and forcible demographic displacement in the areas under the protection of the United Nations forces , i.e . , in mass resettlement and exodus of the Serbian population , violation of human rights , burning and destruction of their property including the Orthodox places of worship and Serbian cultural and historical monuments .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
The primary aim of the Special Rapporteur is to present an objective and impartial assessment of the human rights situation in all countries covered by the mandate on the basis of first-hand information gathered during her missions to the region , as well as information collected by the field operation established by the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat in the former Yugoslavia .  
Certainly , the human tragedy of this continuing matter is enormous both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship and in terms of the relatives of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .  
To the contrary , in the prevailing legal and political order in Iraq with life-threatening laws applicable to persons expressing any opposition to the Government , the conduct of the referendum made a mockery of relevant international human rights standards .  
The United Nations system 's operational activities for rehabilitation during the past year have focused on assisting local communities in rural infrastructure , food production , health improvement , animal health services , rehabilitation of disabled people and human settlements .  The main underlying purpose of these activities is poverty alleviation and human development .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ;  
Ad hoc tribunals could not be a substitute for a permanent international criminal court with the ability to prosecute persons accused of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law wherever the crimes were committed .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
But let me not be misunderstood : while we are deeply worried about the situation in Croatia , we are fully aware of the different qualitative and quantitative dimensions of the violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights violations committed by Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica , Zepa and the wider Banja Luka area .  
The Indonesian delegation shares the deep concern expressed in the draft resolution regarding the continuing violation of international humanitarian law and human rights in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia , as well as the potential consequences for the peace process if this terrible and tragic situation is not expeditiously dealt with .  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
An important area of activity of the Chair shall be the progressive development of a nationwide system of permanent education for democracy and peace through human rights , including the elaboration of special educational programmes for members of such services as the army , the police , penitentiary personnel , the teaching profession , public administration , the judiciary , etc .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in chapter V .  
The policy agenda agreed at the meeting had a strong accent on the following areas : ( a ) a greater external orientation of the least developed countries ' economies ; ( b ) development of a dynamic private enterprise sector ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) eradication of poverty ; and ( e ) a renewed commitment to provide external support .  
Review current global trends in economic and social development as they relate to human settlements , and include recommendations for future actions at the national and international levels .  
As demonstrated by the preparatory process , the implementation of innovative approaches for strengthening institutions and capacity-building do not necessarily require new institutional arrangements , but rather a reorientation of largely existing human , technical and financial resources within a coherent and internally consistent framework .  
Calling on the Secretary-General of the Conference to make appropriate arrangements for convening a regionally representative , independent and prestigious jury to review the best practice submissions and to provide special recognition to the most deserving initiatives promoting sustainable human settlements development in the form of awards to those organizations directly involved in the best practice .  
Given the fact that Rwanda has been ravaged by the genocide and armed conflict in which systematic and gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were perpetrated , the challenges of the rehabilitation effort remain daunting .  
Such a body , linked to the United Nations system and established on a solid legal basis accepted by all States , would be a useful tool which would allow the international community to prosecute and punish those guilty of particularly serious crimes whose hateful nature constituted an insult to the human conscience .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
A political consensus in the international community on the right to development was achieved for the first time at the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of the fundamental rights of the human person , the human person being the central subject of development .  
the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights " .  
In 1968 the interdependence of human rights and development was reiterated more explicitly in the Proclamation of Tehran , 5 / which provides that the achievement of lasting progress in the implementation of human rights is dependent upon sound and effective national and international policies of economic and social development .  
" an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
The right to development combines a comprehensive conception of development in its economic , social , cultural and political dimensions and a requirement of whole and entire realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the self-determination of peoples .  
It goes beyond the traditional conception of economic , social and cultural development by integrating in it the political dimension , basing it on popular participation and social justice , and focusing it on the human being , who is both its artisan and its chief beneficiary .  
As soon afterwards as 1968 the Proclamation of Tehran drew attention to the danger of this dissociation of human rights by proclaiming that : " Since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development points out that " All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development proclaims in its article 1 that " the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
It is one of the purposes of the United Nations , in virtue of the Charter , " to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion " ( Art . 1 , para .  NULL  
States , as the principal actors in the realization of the right to development , should guarantee the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms , strengthen democracy and ensure an honest and transparent public administration and an efficient and impartial administration of justice .  
During the transitional period , civilian tasks include ensuring that refugees and displaced persons can return , supervising property matters , monitoring human rights , re-establishing the normal functioning of all public services , coordinating international support and assistance and organizing and monitoring the conduct of elections .  
Cyprus supported a concerted preventive strategy encompassing preventive diplomacy , human rights , democracy-building , social and sustained economic development , an early-warning system and disaster prevention .  
Member and observer States of IOM were using a newly devised process of strategic planning to affirm and strengthen the organization 's role in dealing with the operational challenges of migration , increasing emphasis on better understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development , and working to ensure the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  
" Distressed at the continued suffering of refugees for whom a solution has yet to be found , and noting with deep concern that refugee protection continues to be jeopardized in many situations as a result of denial of admission , unlawful expulsion , refoulement , unjustified detention , other threats to their physical security , dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights ,  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
The United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , which was the core of the system of operational activities , had provided assistance in such crucial areas as national capacity-building in management , governance and democratization , private sector development and economic reforms , human resources , the social sector and the development of environmentally sound energy sources .  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The assignment of additional resources to a number of priority areas ( political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal monitoring ) was an important practical step , because the focusing of resources should make it easier to achieve the targets which had been set , while taking account of the financial situation of the United Nations .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to cooperate more closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Mr . TRAORE ( Guinea ) said that the five major conferences organized by the United Nations in recent years on questions relating to social development and the conference on human settlements to be held in Istanbul bore witness to the renewed interest and intensive mobilization of the international community in connection with those issues .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
had set up a national committee on human settlements that was coordinating joint efforts among Government organs , local authorities and non-governmental organizations with a view to effective participation in the preparatory process and in the Conference .  
argument was not worth entertaining because the problems of the shelterless , the slum dwellers and the inhabitants of urban areas with deficient civic amenities were so severe and caused such acute human misery , that they needed to be addressed with the utmost urgency .  
Mr . RUDENSKY ( Russian Federation ) said that the problem of human settlements , which encompassed social , economic , industrial , technological , administrative and environmental aspects , had taken on a global dimension .  
Zealand would continue to support the development of practical , flexible and equitable measures to enable the international community to achieve the Convention 's objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations at levels that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system .  
that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Condemns further violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian Armed Forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious , and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
Looks forward to the finalization of the interim report of the independent expert on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 7 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-second session ;  
that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
fact that UNHCR had been required to deal with increasingly frequent emergency situations and large-scale repatriations demonstrated that , if a lasting solution was to be found , root causes of the refugee problem had to be addressed , whether they be armed conflict , economic and social deprivation or gross violations of human rights .  
pointed out that the resolution mentioned above had been adopted on an initiative of the Sudan , motivated by its concern for the situation of more than 20,000 children who had been sequestered by the insurgent movement in the south of the country , which used them as explosives carriers , human shields in minefields and as a military reserve , a situation which was intolerable since it violated religious and humane principles .  
stark contrast between the forceful abduction and subsequent torture of a Turkish Cypriot by the Greek Cypriot police and the humane manner in which the above-mentioned Greek Cypriot offender was treated by the Turkish Cypriot authorities , fully in accordance with the legal procedures , illustrates which side in Cyprus respects human rights and the rule of law and which side is responsible for gross violations .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to increase its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
invoking the data from the reports of the previous Special Rapporteur , with whom the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia severed all relations because of his proven partiality , the authors of draft resolution A / C . 3 / 50 / L . 46 wish to portray that in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia there are " massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law " .  
unsubstantiated and generalized charges of alleged violations of the human rights of the Albanian minority in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are aimed at shifting attention from the open tendencies of the extreme political leadership of the Albanian minority in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija towards the secession of this integral part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights field operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
the global level , it was pushing for a ban on anti-personnel land-mines , an optional protocol to the Convention raising to 18 the minimum age of recruitment into armed forces , and a reordering of priorities away from military spending towards investment in human development .  
addition to ratification , however , there was a need for more decisive action at the national and international level , at a time when certain ultra-conservative and racist groups were seeking to impose discriminatory legislation that denied access to basic educational and health services to children of immigrants , in flagrant violation of their most basic human rights . 
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ;  
that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
the geographic coverage of operational activities had been extended to the CIS countries and their scope now also included administrative reform , the defence of human rights and elections , and financial resources therefore should have been increased accordingly .

Reaffirms that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ;

the geographic coverage of operational activities had been extended to the CIS countries and their scope now also included administrative reform , the defence of human rights and elections , and financial resources therefore should have been increased accordingly .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in General Assembly resolution 48 / 141 ,  
In view of the obvious link between human rights violations , the mass displacement of persons and the emergence of threats to international peace and security , Russia agreed with UNHCR that human rights monitoring must be one of the preventive measures included in plans for United Nations peace-keeping activities and in negotiations on peaceful settlement of disputes , and that safeguarding human rights was closely linked to the protection of refugees .  
The solution should also be a comprehensive one based on prevention , mitigation of damage to the environment and the search for sustainable solutions , which should be based on the political will to protect , defend and promote human rights , guarantee the participation of citizens in government and create an enabling environment for economic and social progress .  
achievement of sustainable solutions required national , regional and international solidarity , which meant that financial and human resources exceeding the capacity of a single country or small group of countries had to be mobilized .  
the meeting of heads of State of the subregion held in Addis Ababa in 1992 with a view to seeking a lasting solution to that human tragedy , it had been recognized that the only way of finally resolving the problem was not simply through achieving a peaceful solution of conflicts but also , and above all , through improving the economic situation of the countries concerned . 
Mr . AYALA LASSO ( United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ) said that the collective vision of the United Nations of the future was that of an Organization reflecting the fact that all human beings were the true participants in the historical process and should be the direct beneficiaries of national and international policies and actions .  
was unacceptable that many were unable to enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms , and it was essential that the international community should be aware of that , in order to make every effort to secure the enjoyment of those rights for indigenous people .  
Solutions to the problems faced by indigenous people must be worked out with their full participation and on the basis of full respect for their human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and identity .  
part of the enhancement of " the capacity of the Organization and of the United Nations system to support the ongoing follow-up to the Conference in the most integrated and effective way , including human and financial requirements " ( para . 32 ) , the Secretary-General is requested to ensure the more effective functioning of the Division for the Advancement of Women in order to carry out all the tasks foreseen for it in the Platform for Action by , inter alia , providing sufficient human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations .  
Looks forward to the finalization of the interim report of the independent expert on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 7 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-second session ;  
Encourages the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to request the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 23 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-second session ;  
that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
situation was critical in certain border provinces , which , overburdened by the provision of enormous financial , material and human resources in the fight against such criminal activities , should receive the support of the international community .  
At its 3rd plenary meeting , on 22 September 1995 , the General Assembly , on the recommendation of the General Committee , decided to include in the agenda of its fiftieth session the item entitled : " Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " and to allocate it to the Third Committee .  
its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , particularly resolution 1995 / 88 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people , and the need for a comprehensive approach by the international community to address root causes and effects of movements of refugees and other displaced persons and the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to make available additional human and financial resources to enhance the capability of the High Commissioner and of the Centre to fulfil effectively their respective mandates and their ability to carry out mandated operational activities and to coordinate efficiently with other relevant parts of the United Nations system on logistical and administrative questions , having due regard to the need to finance and implement activities of the United Nations related to development ;  
convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;  
that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
further that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
note of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , in which they describe the situation in Kosovo , the various discriminatory measures taken in the legislative , administrative and judicial areas , acts of violence and arbitrary arrests perpetrated against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Kosovo , including :  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
further the pertinent resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights condemning the flagrant violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , including the most recent , resolution 1995 / 76 of 8 March 1995 , [ 31 ] / by which the Commission extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a further year and requested him to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session and a final report to the Commission at its fifty-second session ,  
concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
gravely concerned at reports , including by the Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations , and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedoms of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial and forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; forced displacement of persons ; enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; and denial of the freedoms of expression , association and peaceful assembly ;  
concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
further that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
therefore welcomed the opportunity provided by the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to determine how best to make use of the changes at the international level with a view to enhancing respect for the generally accepted norms and principles of international law , for which purpose collective and sustained efforts towards the development and codification of the law in the areas of disarmament , the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts , the protection of human rights and the promotion of development would be required .  
that had to be complemented by action aimed at improving the terms of trade for the least developed countries , channelling foreign direct investment in a meaningful way and providing financial and technical assistance to develop human resources and build economic and social institutions .  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
fact , through the draft resolution before us , members of the Council have the opportunity to express , in a united voice and in the strongest possible terms , their condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights committed in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia , demanding that all concerned , particularly the Serbs , comply fully with their obligations in this regard .  
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
considered the question of capital punishment as a very sensitive human rights issue , and had always requested that it should be considered in international forums in a constructive and cooperative spirit .  
Government looked to the Chinese Government to take specific steps to conform to international human rights norms , including releasing persons detained solely for the peaceful expression of their opinions and preserving the unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage of Tibet .  
to observe basic civil rights to a fair trial and freedom of expression , as had been the case in Nigeria recently with the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other prominent human rights activists , destroyed confidence in the judiciary , frightened people and impeded their empowerment .  
With respect to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the conversion of some temporary posts to permanent posts should be deferred , he said it was difficult to demand a high level of efficiency from the Centre when significant new mandates had been assigned to it without commensurate human and financial resources .  
programme had been mentioned in two General Assembly resolutions , resolutions 48 / 132 and 49 / 194 , and represented not only an initiative designed to help Member States to build and strengthen their national capacities , but also an aspect of international action in the field of human rights which deserved recognition as being equal in importance to the monitoring mechanisms . 
MEKDAD ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action had stated that all human rights were universal , interdependent and interconnected and that the international community should deal with human rights in a comprehensive , equitable and even-handed manner , while taking regional and cultural specificities into consideration .  
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
he said that States were currently faced with a choice : to be part of a harmonious international system whose regional and international efforts were based on human morality , or to remain indifferent to sedition , ethnic cleansing and ideological hostility .  NULL AMOR ( Tunisia ) reaffirmed Tunisia 's commitment to provide all necessary assistance to United Nations refugee-related activities .  
It was essential for the international community to define and implement a global approach to refugee problems , based on prevention , the reduction of the negative effects of the presence of refugees on the host country and the search for durable solutions , in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of human beings and prevent other humanitarian crises .  
delegation was fully convinced that economic development alone was not enough to prevent humanitarian crises , and that political efforts were required to promote respect for human rights , the rule of law and responsible management of public affairs .  
VOLSKI ( Georgia ) said that his country 's traditions and culture were a clear example of the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic groups and religions and that the current obstacle to ensuring fundamental human rights was the grave economic and social situation .  
NAJEM ( Lebanon ) said that Israel was responsible for flagrant and persistent violations of human rights in the occupied territories of southern Lebanon , the western Bekaa and surrounding areas .  
the light of his findings , the Special Rapporteur puts forward a number of recommendations ranging from the consolidation of democratic institutions and the reform of the judicial system to the establishment of a national police force accepted by both communities and the deployment of human rights observers .  
It is equally important for Governments to facilitate the development of productive sectors ; mobilize national energies and resources for the provision of human capital and institution-building , infrastructure and basic social services ; develop long-term analysis , planning and evaluation ; promote sustainable development and equitable distribution of growth benefits ; and ensure the coordination of all development activities .  
A stable legal framework , fair and efficient law enforcement and equal access to public services and justice , in accordance with international standards of human rights , are essential conditions for the creation of transparent and accountable institutions , for the promotion of a public administration that is responsive to the needs of the population and for the prevention of and fight against all forms of corruption .  
We have also implemented educational reform , whose main challenges are to ensure reliable , ongoing training for our human resources by dynamic means , through an educational system that can be constantly renewed and improved in order to meet training and development needs .  
These included the rethinking of existing organizational structures and the introduction of role delineation ; the revision of existing legislation and the introduction of new legislation to reflect subsidiarity ; the introduction of an information technology infrastructure ; sustained development initiatives in management of change and business re-engineering ; the setting up of local Government to enhance citizen empowerment ; the revamping of human resources practices and procedures ; the new salary structure , which reduced 96 pay scales to 20 ; and the introduction of a code of ethics for all public officers .  
Among the objectives of the audit are the necessary refocusing of the administration on its essential tasks ; the organization and establishment of well-adapted structures and flexible procedures to carry out these tasks ; and the establishment of adequate resources , both material and human , for the effective and efficient functioning of the administration .  
Untiring efforts have also been made in the promotion of human rights , particularly in respect of information , democratic participation and the administrative and legal functions of democratic institutions guaranteeing the civil and political rights of the population , including documentation , the local administration of justice and civic education .  
The destruction , massacres and immeasurable suffering in Lebanon reported by the mass media , which show human bodies that have been cut up and mutilated , is unequivocal proof of the barbaric nature of the aggression taking place at the hands of the Israelis .  
The failure of the Security Council to act at the appropriate time , in response to Lebanon 's request , makes the Council responsible for the heavy human toll , the severe human suffering and the substantial physical damage sustained by Lebanon .  
It is our hope that the international community , represented by the General Assembly , will fulfil its collective responsibility and put an immediate end to the ongoing aggression , prevail upon Israel to implement United Nations resolutions , especially Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , and pay adequate compensation for human losses and the physical damage to Lebanese institutions , historical sites and service facilities .  
The new Mission was able adequately to ensure the presence of the international community and the direct support of the United Nations for the peace process , especially in the areas that proved to be most critical to the implementation of the Chapultepec Agreement : public security , constitutional and legislative reform , the land-transfer programme and the transfer of rural human settlements .  
At the same time , in operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution , the General Assembly welcomes the recommendation contained in the Secretary-General 's report to renew the mandate of the joint participation of the United Nations with the Organization of American States in the International Civilian Mission to Haiti , with the task of verifying full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to establish a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the consolidation of democratic institutions .  
In addition to paying tribute to the people of Haiti in its ongoing search for a strong and lasting democracy , justice and economic prosperity , the General Assembly reaffirms the international community 's commitment to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , with a view to supporting social and economic development efforts and to strengthening Haitian institutions that must administer justice and ensure democracy , the observance of human rights , political stability and economic development .  
International peace and security , free trade , social development based on growth with equity , environmental protection , democracy and human rights are the basic components of the future work of our multilateral system . 
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .  
Other pressing issues include the population explosion , environmental degradation , the water shortage , desertification , the food deficit , the growing gap between the North and the South , the regional arms race , the threat posed by nuclear weapons , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , development concerns , barriers to economic and trade cooperation , the removal of restrictions on free trade and , last but not least , human rights .  
In considering the architecture for United Nations renewal , we should shape an Organization better prepared to respond to the following four priority needs : first , restraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructive weaponry ; secondly , bolstering United Nations capabilities for effective peacekeeping and peace-building ; thirdly , assisting economic and social development while enhancing protection of the environment ; and fourthly , improving mechanisms for ensuring respect for international law and human rights .  
Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities of stemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction , bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building capabilities , advancing sustainable economic and social development , and reinforcing our joint commitment to international law and human rights ? 
One person less going to bed with an empty stomach , one person less torn with pain , one person less denied shelter small pragmatic steps inspired by the innate dignity of each human being ; acts of caring solidarity which each individual , each family , each community is capable of ; commitment to others generates hope .  
Portugal has repeatedly stated and I do so here once again that its sole objective , apart from the immediate concern of defending the human rights and identity of the people of East Timor in their different aspects , is to find a just , comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor , in accordance with international law and the full respect for the rights of its people , namely its right to self-determination .  
The consolidation of democratic Governments , growing respect for human rights and economic and social progress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for the future of Latin America , a continent to which Spain is linked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship and confidence .  
Despite the magnitude of the obstacles that have to be overcome in order to ensure that human beings are educated for peace , Mexico maintains a profound faith in the United Nations , whose structures must be strengthened if we truly wish to give it the necessary capacity to discharge the complex and lofty tasks entrusted to it half a century ago , as well as those additional tasks it is charged with almost daily . 
Any government , institution or individual seeking to promote human rights should bear in mind the significance of national and regional peculiarities as well as historical , cultural and religious backgrounds and the stage of economic development .  
We should be happy to do so without repeating any of the recent tired , uncharitable and inaccurate nostrums about the death of the obligation to accord economic preferences to poor countries , even as we clamour that human rights and humanitarianism have now been elevated to a place of honour in the international pantheon .  
The various protagonists must understand that only a new political agreement , based on ordinary common sense , with respect for the intangible principles of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , will contribute to an acceptable solution to all .  
This endeavour includes the aspiration to receive fair treatment in international economic relations ; to try to save children from starvation and disease ; to promote emergency assistance to refugees and disaster victims ; to attempt to combat crime , drug addiction and disease ; to promote education and the development of human resources ; and to tackle the enormous task of halting or slowing the progressive ecological deterioration of our planet .  
Tunisia 's steadfast efforts to consolidate the foundations of the country 's political institutions and the rule of law and to promote and protect human rights in their global dimension flow from a civilized , irreversible choice made in accordance with universal values .  
Eager to ensure respect for human dignity and to encourage ongoing development efforts to secure the well-being of all citizens , Tunisia has been able to reconcile , in a balanced manner , economic growth with the preservation of political , economic and social rights , the requisite foundations of democracy .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
If it is first and foremost up to the African countries to demonstrate that their marginalization is determined only by fate and that their current situation is merely one of those tragic aftermaths with which history has frequently sprinkled the course of human events , then it is also up to the international community as a whole , in active solidarity , to make a special commitment to supporting the efforts of the African countries to deal with the challenges before them .  
With regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms , I would underline the specific , dynamic and publicly visible results of some recent United Nations decisions , such as the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights , the establishment and effective functioning of International Tribunals to prosecute and judge persons accused of serious violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , and measures taken , or scheduled to be taken , in combating terrorism and organized crime .  
One can not talk simultaneously about the existence of universal values , such as democracy or human rights , and still feel satisfied with a situation in which poverty and the AIDS epidemic are steadily gaining ground , thus exacerbating the divisions within the international community and thwarting national efforts .  
The consolidation of democracy and the construction of a State based on the rule of law and respect for human rights are positive results of the activities of the international community , as reflected in the resolutions of the United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as in the decisions and recommendations handed down by several conferences organized under United Nations auspices or with its support . 
Since the beginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated and organized a number of world summit conferences on a set of global issues ranging from environment to social development , from population to human rights , from women to children and coming up we have the World Food Summit , the aim of which is to find and implement coordinated measures at all levels national , regional , and international to solve problems of importance for the future of all nations .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
The qualitative developments that have taken place in Mali 's northern regions show clearly the determination of Mali 's young democracy to tackle and resolve all problems in a concerted and peaceful way , with the active participation of all players and with scrupulous respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
We are therefore encouraged to think that the time has come for the establishment of a new global human order that would be based on respect for national sovereignty , participatory democracy , socio-economic equality , people-centred development and the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
If we were to agree that the chain connecting home , primary school , secondary school , university , and life broke down some time ago , and that it is missing its first link , without which all else is pointless and without foundation , we would invest at the very roots of human life the economic and scientific resources needed to form human beings from the start , enabling them to grow , endowed with the values that would make them citizens .  
Nevertheless , just as we understand that the world has changed , that there is a new international agenda governed by the common concerns of all peoples over environment preservation , population growth , respect for human rights , strengthening of democratic systems , recognition of women 's rights , and the social and economic development of nations , we also understand that this Organization must be renewed and readapted to the new world circumstances . 
Furthermore , these leaders unanimously called for in-depth reflection so that we might enter the twenty-first century with a restructured , reinvigorated Organization , equipped with the necessary human , material and financial resources to more effectively accomplish the lofty mission of an Organization that harmonizes the complementary efforts of Member States in order to achieve new goals in a context of freedom and active solidarity . 
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
We therefore share the anguish of the international community for those countries where internal strife and regional conflict , and their attendant human suffering , continue to deny economic and social progress to millions of their people . 
Despite these efforts , which have continued for several years , this twofold response has proved woefully inadequate to alleviate the ills that have slowed the progress and political , economic and social development of the human race .  
Despite this association and the new intellectual , political and economic trends brought about by the changes , the structural notions of the international system have not developed in tandem with the requirements of human development , as manifested by the communications revolution , the exchange of ideas , the flow of information and the technological applications that have influenced international relations in various ways . 
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It is a human , social , political and economic imperative for the international community and for all the actors and partners in development , in their own specific actions , to work responsibly for a more just and equitable framework for international trade , favouring a free and democratic economic partnership .  
The human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic is another scourge of our time and a serious threat to humanity .  The socio-economic consequences of the disease are a matter of grave concern , and the international community should make concerted efforts to address this human tragedy which affects the young and the productive sectors of our societies in particular before it is too late .  
There is evidence the world over that continuing poverty , if not addressed adequately , will result in social disharmony and in economic and political disorder , and will become a threat to national and international peace and stability , thereby negatively affecting the growth and consolidation of democracy and human rights .  
It has played a significant , discernible and indispensable role in human affairs , from the peaceful resolution of conflicts and peacekeeping to economic development and social progress , from food and agriculture to employment and labour standards , from helping the children of our world to fostering human rights and justice .  
The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States , the tragedy of refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the consequent destruction of the environment , the spread of disease , the degeneration of moral values , the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur .  
Its objectives responsible management , food security , development of human resources , the proper and effective use of natural resources , cooperation and economic regional integration are ambitious but feasible .  
It is already clear today that the conflict imposed on the Tajik people an enormous human tragedy was aimed at undermining the newly emerging foundations of the State and interfering with economic growth and market reforms and hence the country 's independent development along a general democratic course .  
Not only is this new Constitution the best we have ever had , but it also embraces the people 's political expectations for the advent of a true sense of justice and fair play as well as their deep love of freedom , respect for human rights , and a strong nationalistic feeling predicated on a desire to associate with the rest of the world on a free and equitable basis . 
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
Moreover , it will be in the cities and towns of this urban world that growing social tensions and conflict , rooted in poverty and the maldistribution of resources , will be resolved , and where the key to true human security will be found .  
The Government , in partnership with other sectors of society , is playing a multiple role in improving living and working conditions on an equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoy adequate shelter , affordable basic services and sustainable human settlements .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
The predictable result has been an explosion in the number of armed conflicts , accompanied by widespread devastation , both human and physical , gross violations of human rights , and ethnic cleansing .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
My Government has set itself specific goals including balanced and integrated sectoral growth , a relevant and adaptive education system , health for all , and strategic human resource planning and development .  
Given the proliferation of internal conflicts and regional tensions , the harmful effects of economic disorder , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the rise of crime and terrorism , violations of human rights , the ever-widening international character of drug-trafficking networks and the deterioration of the environment , there is no single area of international relations that does not require a collective effort on the part of States if it is to be mastered . 
Baali ( Algeria ) ( interpretation from French ) : Allow me , before making a few general comments on the report and role of the International Court of Justice , to perform the very pleasant duty of paying a well-deserved tribute to the President of the International Court of Justice , Mr . Mohammed Bedjaoui , a diplomat , jurist and statesman with exceptional professional , moral and human qualities , who has left a very clear stamp on the history of international relations over the last four decades .  
Chowdhury ( Bangladesh ) : At its fiftieth session the General Assembly reaffirmed the commitments made by the Heads of the State or Government at Copenhagen and decided to give highest priority to the national , regional and international policies and actions for the promotion of social progress , justice and the betterment of the human condition , based on full participation by all .  
It is focusing on strengthening the institutional capacities of government , at both the central and local levels , with regard to policy management and poverty monitoring ; promoting human resources development by providing better access to health and education opportunities ; alleviating rural poverty ; and developing and strengthening the basic social-safety net , among other issues .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation 's sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help to generate renewed political will at the national and international levels to attain the objectives of sustainable human development .  
Society must be firmly rooted in the rule of law , democratic participation , gender equality , the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all , social justice , tolerance , respect for ethnic , religious and cultural diversity , and meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs , such as young and older people , as well as people with disabilities .  
We in Japan believe that such genuine development can only be achieved on the basis of a comprehensive approach to development which would involve activities ranging over the economic and social fields , such as financial resource mobilization through official development assistance , investment and trade , and human resource mobilization through social integration of people by means of ensuring basic education , primary health care and empowerment of all groups of people in society .  
It is gratifying to see that the United Nations can be the international forum that enables the formulation and adoption , by the highest representatives of States , of such ambitious commitments as the commitment to eradicate absolute poverty by a target date to be set by each country , or the pursuit of the objective of full employment and the protection of social integration based on the enhancement and protection of human rights for all . .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
My country has assumed the responsibility to diminish poverty in the short term through social and economic strategies geared not only towards meeting basic physical needs such as health , nutrition , education and work , but which are also aimed at defending human rights and promoting the equitable distribution of income and wealth .  
There is a widespread feeling of dissatisfaction sometimes veiled and sometimes explicit with an Organization that still embodies the loftiest ideals ever conceived by the human spirit in the search for peace and understanding among peoples .  Brazil is committed to the United Nations Charter and to the Organization 's political , legal and diplomatic legacy of the past 50 years .  
In accordance with article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which Andorra signed and ratified less than a year ago , thus contributing to the universal process of ratification so desired by the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , it is vital that Governments ensure that tolerance and human rights are taught freely and comprehensively at school in order to rear new generations that are much more sensitive to the universality and relevance of these rights . 
Indeed , concurrent with the expansion of participatory democracy in many countries , a complex movement has emerged towards autocracy or even totalitarianism at the international level , a trend which is founded on hegemony and flouts justice , freedom , participation , the rule of law , tolerance , human rights , pluralism and democracy in a dangerous and unprecedented manner .  
Honduras is a firm believer in the fact that cooperation between the two organizations constitutes positive progress towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region , allowing the countries there to have a broader forum for discussion and negotiation in the search for solutions to economic , social , cultural , political and humanitarian problems and respect for human rights .  
We also consider very encouraging the progress made in the areas of human rights ; police training ; cooperation in regional human resources training through the United Nations University fellowships programme ; improved cooperation with the Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , as well as the joint programmes for international drug control aimed at harmonization at the local level of legislation and the work of the agencies responsible for this problem ; the improvement of the condition of women ;  
As this is based on a harmonious cultural hegemony that serves as a solid foundation for the defense of human rights , it is clear that there is a strong political will , public opinion and social awareness in favour of positive action .  
Turbay ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : As stated in the draft resolution before us today , the United Nations must be the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends such as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
This is a major responsibility of our territorial sovereignty and brings with it an inheritance of advances in technology , human labour and rapid interocean transportation in sum , the successful development of a valuable resource for worthy joint activities of benefit above all to the people of Panama and in general to all the peoples of the Earth .  
It is no secret that the North Korean regime relies for its survival on a totalitarian system of control and an anachronistic personality cult , sustained by subjecting its people to a virtual state of slavery , by denying them the most fundamental human rights , by supporting international terrorism and by all the other accompaniments of a failed , rogue State .  
We are committed to supporting the implementation of the recommendations , which we hope will lead to real progress in fostering human and social capacity , in strengthening economic performance and in protecting the environment , thus laying firm foundations for a better future for all African people .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) has focused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating progress in agricultural development , food security , human resources development , rural and urban development , the establishment and maintenance of infrastructures , the creation of the appropriate social environment , and the enhancement of regional economic cooperation .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
For their part , African people and their leaders need to continue to apply themselves to the immense task of bettering their prospects of recovery through ongoing programmes of political and economic reform , releasing the energies both physical and intellectual of the citizenry through the protection and promotion of civil liberties and fundamental human rights , and through the empowerment of women and youth , who are the underutilized agents of economic endeavour .  
It has been acknowledged by the United Nations , by the specialized agencies and by the entire international community as a whole as exceptional in terms of urgencies and opportunities , which calls for an exceptional mobilization of political will , and of human , technological and financial resources in order to speed up implementation of the New Agenda for the remainder of the decade and beyond , in later years , in line with the draft resolution recommended in section IV of document A / 51 / 48 .  
The external environment must be supportive of the identified critical interventions for African development and recovery in such areas as the diversification of their export products , intensification of regional integration , human resource development , the provision of adequate resource flows and durable solutions to their external debts .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
The report of the Secretary-General on this item ( A / 51 / 381 ) is especially helpful in that it recalls the need to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States . 
a more practical , attainable peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interests of all concerned .  
El Salvador finds itself today on the road to becoming an open participatory society in full development , thanks , among other factors , to its enormous efforts in implementing an ambitious agenda of change and achieving the agreed commitments related to the transfer of land and human settlements , the strengthening of the National Civilian Police , the modernization of the judicial and electoral systems , and the ratification of international instruments on human rights . 
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
The incorporation of international human rights standards into national laws and policies and the building or strengthening of national institutions capable of protecting and promoting human rights and democracy under the rule of law are an inseparable , essential part of the democratic reform process and hence should be supported .  
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa , now so dramatically changed in the space of a few days , underlines the importance of being prepared to respond in a timely , coordinated and effective manner to humanitarian crises in order to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
One can not but conclude that the progressive development and codification of international law would benefit from the recognition of the primacy of national laws in their interaction with applicable international law in the conduct of States ; in the preservation of the environment and ecological balance ; in respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms ; in the need to contain and eradicate the inordinate and indiscriminate bite of terrorism ; and in the espousal of the democratic ideal .  
The application of the kind of measures referred to in the draft resolution introduced today by the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya not only represents an attack on the identity of the State concerned and on its political , economic and cultural elements , but also affects other sensitive areas such as the ability of the peoples suffering from those unilateral policies fully to enjoy their human rights .  
Furthermore , pursuant to resolution 1994 / 47 of the Commission on Human Rights , the Secretary-General informed that body , in his report contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 43 , that application of unilateral coercive measures is incompatible with the principle of international cooperation , has an adverse impact on the economies of developing countries suffering under the measures and constitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the individuals , groups and peoples affected .  
Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
Given the progress made to date , we can not forget that we must move towards prohibiting and completely eliminating this kind of weapon , because of its mass , indiscriminate and devastating effects , its long-term threat , its tragic human consequences and its widespread hindrance of the productive use of broad areas , particularly affecting those most in need and seriously jeopardizing the living conditions of many peoples .  
The current international political and security situation is burdened with many crises , cases of blatant violation of international law , the uncontrolled hoarding of arms , upsets of the ecological balance , disrespect for human rights , widespread international terrorism , and tensions in economic and social development .  
Operative paragraph 1 reaffirms the work to be done by the joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States : monitoring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Haiti , providing technical assistance for institutional development in police training and in the establishment of an impartial judicial system and supporting the development of programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights to ensure coexistence and the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
It also recognizes the following essential bases for social development : democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , responsible governance and the participation of civil society , as well as peace , freedom , stability and national and international security .  
As I have stated before , Japan , which has experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently hopes that nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , will never again be used and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
During this time , Member States that have participated in the deliberations have spoken on a wide range of issues surrounding that continent , especially its role and influence on the atmosphere , oceans , biological conditions of the entire global system and the fragility of its environment , which is vulnerable to the impact of human activities .  
The systematic efforts to annihilate 20-million Iraqis were contrary to all international instruments , which must lead the international community to consider economic sanctions as an internationally prohibited weapon of mass destruction , since the application of sanctions against Iraq had caused significantly more victims than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima , which was ironic in the extreme given the degree of interest currently evinced in human rights . 
The long-standing bipolar nuclear confrontation has been replaced by mostly regional , subregional and intra-State conflicts arising from political , economic and social difficulties , and by massive violations of human rights , including those of ethnic minorities .  
Stresses that Governments , in partnership with civil society and all other development actors , including non-governmental organizations and people living in poverty and their organizations should cooperate to meet the basic human needs of all - inter alia , income , resources , education , health care , nutrition , shelter , sanitation and safe water - in particular of people living in poverty and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups ;  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
Stresses the need for Governments and relevant international institutions or organizations to examine how the rapid globalization of the world economy and the increased liberalization of trade is affecting the ability of States to design and implement effective strategies for eradicating poverty and to provide a stable legal framework that creates an enabling environment to achieve social development and to meet the basic human needs of all , in order to prevent greater inequality between different sectors of society ;  
Invites all relevant specialized agencies , funds , programmes and related organizations of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , to strengthen and adjust their activities , programmes and strategies , as appropriate , with a view to achieving the overall goal of eradicating poverty , meeting the basic human needs of all and promoting self-reliance and community-based initiatives , through , inter alia , financial and technical support to developing countries in their efforts to translate all measures , recommendations and commitments into operational and concrete programmes , projects and activities ;  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
The definition of basic human needs is broader in scope and extends to essential aspects of life , including employment , shelter and personal freedom .  Discussion focused on the provision of basic social services as an effective and cost-efficient way to reduce poverty and a fundamental contribution to the satisfaction of basic human needs .  
The occupation itself constituted the primary violation of the human rights of the civilian population and was the source of other violations and harsh practices by the occupying Israeli authorities , including closure and sealing of the occupied territories , land confiscation , the demolition of Palestinian homes , the detention of Palestinians , and the killing of Palestinians by military and undercover security forces .  
The violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by Croatian forces which were mentioned in the Secretary-General 's report on the situation in the occupied territories of Croatia ( A / 50 / 648 ) were a cause of deep concern , and Canada called upon the Croatian Government to prosecute those responsible , to do everything in its power to protect fundamental human freedoms in the territories under its control , and to permit the safe return of refugees and displaced persons .  
The Security Council strongly condemns the violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in the former sectors North and South in the Republic of Croatia , as described in the report of the Secretary-General , including killings of several hundreds of civilians , systematic and widespread looting and arson and other forms of destruction of property .  The Council expresses its deep concern that there is a considerable discrepancy between the number of perpetrators that have so far been brought to justice and the number of reported violations of international humanitarian law and human rights .  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Most of these countries were pursuing the following similar paths to increase or improve the quality of reproductive health services : ( a ) developing human resources , including training of medical and / or paramedical staff in reproductive health ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ; ( c ) developing medical protocols for RH / FP services ; and ( d ) increasing the availability of reproductive health services .  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
Themes found in both the guidelines and the common advocacy statement include putting people first ; promoting sustainable human development ; reducing gender inequality and inequity ; fostering accountability and transparency ; developing common indicators that are critical to the monitoring of programme impact ; strengthening country-level collaboration ; enhancing national capacity-building ; and facilitating dialogue between and among the United Nations resident coordinator system , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society . 
KODELLAS ( Greece ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that for the past 21 years it had been indisputable that the Cyprus problem was a clear case of the violation of the territorial integrity , unity and sovereignty of an independent State , of massive human rights violations and of the artificial division of a country by military force . 
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
The promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people could be guaranteed only by strict observance of the international human rights instruments and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , particularly as set forth in the fourth Geneva Convention .  
The most obvious case of grave violations of human rights in an industrialized country , however , was that of the United States , where the " American dream " was a tragic nightmare for vast sectors of its population in a society that was unable to conceal the situation of extreme inequality and open discrimination that affected tens of millions of African Americans , Latin Americans , Asians and indigenous people .  
Perhaps the most accurate picture of the true human rights situation in the United States was to be found in its judicial and penitentiary system , where 1.5-million persons filled the prisons of that country , which had the highest rate of imprisonment and the largest juvenile penal system in the world .  
The full realization of human rights , however , remained fragile , as was apparent not only from the tragedies in Rwanda and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , but also from the continuing violations in all parts of the world , which took the form of summary executions , arbitrary detention , disappearances and torture and manifestations of new forms of racism and xenophobia in disregard of the fundamental principles of humanitarian law .  
Other initiatives which his delegation was presenting to the General Assembly at the current session concerned the protection of minorities , which called for enhanced international cooperation to defuse conflict situations ; attention to the specific needs of children and juveniles in conflict with the law in the context of human rights in the administration of justice ; and the plight of internally displaced persons , in respect of which the work of the Secretary-General 's representative on that question had been crucial .  
The entire programme for the Decade should be aimed at a genuine democratization of international relations based on law through the creation of an atmosphere in which all States observed such fundamental principles as respect for the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of States , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of international disputes and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The human rights approach to women 's health implied that international and national policies must be based on recognition of women 's rights , including the right to reproductive and sexual health and family planning , and demanded full commitment to the removal of economic , social and legal disadvantages that denied women their right to health .  
The Government of Cyprus was committed to ensuring that women enjoyed all their human rights and that they were equal partners in shaping the economic , political , social and cultural development of their country .  
PAIK ( Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan ) said that Afghanistan was in a desperate situation on account of the continued armed conflict with its attendant massacres , disappearances and violations of human rights , and that the land mines which were still widely scattered throughout the country , despite the heroic operations of the demining programmes conducted by United Nations agencies and numerous non-governmental organizations still posed a danger .  
The collapse of the central authority also posed extreme difficulties for the protection of human rights , while the administration of justice continued to be arbitrary and local authorities were unable to prevent some sections of the population from engaging in arms dealing and trafficking in narcotics and cultural artifacts .  
It was also essential to create conditions for the reconstruction of civil society , particularly for the holding of free and fair elections and for building democratic institutions which would guarantee the rule of law and foster deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It must never be forgotten that behind the statistics , concepts and operational schemes were individuals caught in tragic situations whose only hope was a universal respect for the notion of human dignity , even if that was limited to the minimum for life , namely safety , food , shelter , water , medicine and basic education .  
In short , the enjoyment of human rights was closely linked to the international community 's ability to ensure the universal ratification and implementation of instruments that dealt with the rights that all States represented in Vienna had pledged to protect .  The meeting rose at 1.25 p.m .  
Taking into account the foregoing evaluation of institutions charged with protecting human rights and the radically changed political and human rights situation , the responsibilities of MICIVIH during a next phase would consist of two main elements : ( a ) technical assistance in the field of institution-building based on the observation and evaluation of institutional performance and reforms with reference to human rights ; and ( b ) the development of a programme for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
The training programme for trainers in civic and human rights education begun by MICIVIH would be expanded substantially to involve non-governmental organizations working in adult education , elected government officials at all levels , popular and peasant organizations , women 's associations , religious institutions and the formal education sector .  
To that end , the Ministry of State responsible for women 's status and problems , in cooperation with other State agencies , had undertaken the collection of gender-based statistics , developed programmes of vocational and technical education for girls and a policy of credit for women entrepreneurs , incorporated women 's human rights in the curricula of human rights education in secondary schools , launched public awareness campaigns and developed measures to eliminate violence against women .  
Thirdly and finally , the international community , through UNOMIL , humanitarian cooperation , support for the needs of economic and social development and the monitoring of human rights and the electoral process , inter alia , is strengthening national and regional efforts .  
If all those conditions , which were currently unacceptable and flouted the dignity of the human being , were to be eradicated , it was essential to create a framework for social development founded on a spirit of cooperation and participation which would take into account the cultural , historical , religious and economic characteristics and the priorities for social development of each country . 
Convinced that democracy was a prerequisite for respect for human dignity and socio-economic development , the Sudan had held popular congresses at the national , regional , provincial and local levels .  
Furthermore , as the participants at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen had underscored , the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms as well the strengthening of democracy within the framework of equitable economic relations and a favourable international economic environment were an integral part of social development .  
With regard to the human rights of women , particularly the right to equal status , which was dealt with in the Beijing Platform for Action , he stressed that the first woman prime minister in the world had been elected in Sri Lanka and that the election of Mrs . Kumaratunga to the office of President by an overwhelming popular vote indicated that Sri Lankans accepted the role of women in political and social life and their holding the highest public offices .  
He deplored the continuing flagrant mass violations of human rights taking place throughout the world , and concluded that the protection and promotion of human rights was a long and exacting task which required the undivided attention and vigilance of all members of the international community , from United Nations bodies and national Governments to non-governmental organizations and individuals .  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
In his report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the Secretary-General had stated that the lives of millions of Iraqis were threatened by hunger , which had not deterred the Power that currently dominated the world from deliberately ignoring the humanitarian and legal aspects of such threats or from using the pretext of human rights to serve its political purposes and seeking to overthrow the current legitimate Government of Iraq .  
Had the Special Rapporteur behaved in a neutral or objective manner , he would have called , without any hesitation and for purely humanitarian , legal and moral reasons , for the lifting of sanctions , at least in part on the grounds that human rights must be respected not only by individual countries but also by international organizations , particularly the Security Council .  
Of the initiatives taken by the High Commissioner , her delegation wished to mention , in particular , the machinery established in respect of special procedures , monitoring organs and non-governmental organizations , and especially the dialogue with Governments , since it considered that direct contacts with senior officials of Member States could only promote a better understanding of local realities and a fair appreciation of the development of the situation regarding human rights in Member States .  
The promotion of democracy , the strengthening of the protection of human rights and economic and social development formed an interdependent whole , as the World Conference on Human Rights had already stated ; democracy opened the way for the promotion and protection of fundamental freedoms but was able to sustain and consolidate itself only if it was able to respond to the individual and collective needs of citizens .  
In that connection , it should be underlined that the protection and international promotion of human rights would be effective only if they were based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social ) .  
Referring to paragraph 25 of the report concerning communications in which individuals or non-governmental organizations reported human rights violations , she said that her delegation insisted on the need to make judicious use of those procedures in order to avoid giving free rein to partisan judgements , and considered that , in order to preserve the credibility of the United Nations , the Organization should make every effort to prevent the machinery and procedures from being exploited for unacknowledged purposes .  
A strengthened Centre could not only mobilize public awareness but also provide vital assistance to Governments and non-governmental organizations in the field of advisory services and training with a view to facilitating implementation and understanding of human rights instruments at the national level .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
A particular weakness relates to understanding the interlinkages between economic activities and their social and environmental impacts , which can be distant in space and time ( though the knowledge base concerning the relationship between human activities and climate change has improved significantly in recent years ( see the report of the Secretary-General on chapter 9 of Agenda 21 ( Protection of the atmosphere ) ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 2 ) ) ) .  
It was in the best interests of all States to support genuine efforts devoid of any hidden political interest and to that end , to enter into a frank dialogue and to emphasize crisis prevention rather than simply reacting to human rights violations which usually accompanied crises .  It was in that spirit that his delegation supported the appeal for new human and financial resources launched by the High Commissioner for Human Rights .  
At the Vienna Conference on human rights , the international community had recognized that human rights were universal , indivisible and interdependent and had charted a course of action in the field of human rights into the next century ; however , its attention and efforts must be focused on the implementation of all existing human rights instruments , not only so that the perpetrators of human rights violations could be condemned but so that the rule of law should be respected in the future . 
There had been great progress in the human rights field since the establishment of the Organization , but , as the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights had stressed , the relevant instruments must be strengthened in order to make them more effective and so as to establish a better balance between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights , on the other .  
Aware of the importance of a human rights culture and of the need to strengthen the democratic process , her Government had implemented a series of legislative , administrative and educational measures recommended by the advisory committee on human rights , a national body established in 1990 , which was composed of representatives of the entire political , social and religious spectrum of Moroccan society .  
KAMAL ( Pakistan ) , speaking on agenda item 112 ( c ) , said that , while there were many types of human rights violations , the primary concern of the United Nations was the systematic violation of human rights committed by States and persons in authority and that the United Nations could influence Member States to take legislative , administrative and judicial measures to promote and protect human rights .  
SHAH ( India ) said that India , a pluralistic nation with well-established humanistic traditions of tolerance , harmony and non-violence , guaranteed fundamental human rights to all its citizens ; those rights were enforced by an independent judiciary and jealously guarded by a free and vigilant press , an articulate public opinion and a vast network of non-governmental organizations .  
India was encouraged that the international community had adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which underlined the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights , civil , political , economic , social and cultural , identified new forms of intolerance and violence and defined particularly vulnerable groups ( children and minorities ) who deserved special consideration .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
We reaffirm our commitment to South-South cooperation as a necessary and viable strategy for greater collective self-reliance for national , regional and global development and as a major mechanism for the promotion of growth and accelerated development , including human resource development , and affirm the importance of holding the ninth session of IFCC during 1995 , and our full support for the convening of a United Nations Conference on south-south cooperation in 1997 .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
The following questions , among others , were considered : protection of aboriginal people , including land claims and self-government ; protection against discrimination with respect to race and sex ; assistance programmes for minorities ; incorporation in human rights legislation of more explicit reference to economic , social and cultural rights ; judicial control over administrative decisions ; and differences between provincial and federal legislation in the field of human rights .  
The High Commissioner raised such matters as : arbitrary and preventive detention ; the treatment of detainees , including cases of custodial rape by members of the police and security forces ; cases of enforced disappearance ; failure to take judicial action against police officers accused of violations of human rights ; the partial application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to disturbed areas of the country ; social inequalities relating to the caste system ; and policies adopted to eliminate the caste of untouchable .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
The coordination of human rights activities throughout the United Nations system was the subject of debate in the framework of the coordination segment of the Economic and Social Council ( 26-30 June 1995 ) which had on its agenda coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields . 
The treaty bodies , based on six human rights conventions , have not only become effective structures monitoring the compliance by States with the human rights obligations resulting from those treaties : their impact in the field of human rights goes far beyond this function and extends , inter alia , to clarification of the content of human rights ; the functioning of the human rights machinery , including early warning and preventive measures ; cooperation of Governments with the United Nations ; protection of individuals in the framework of optional communications procedures ; and human rights education .  
In line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , measures are being taken to make the human rights machinery : ( a ) more effective and cost efficient ; ( b ) able to act swiftly and to respond appropriately to human rights situations ; ( c ) stronger , through international cooperation in the field of human rights , based on mutual confidence ; and ( d ) more transparent and understandable to the outside world .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Acknowledging the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , and its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
Lightly armed peace-keepers and unarmed civilians were sent into areas of active warfare , where their courageous efforts helped to save untold human lives and to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population .  
In addition , we are very concerned about the continued UNITA military activity in some regions of the country , in a pattern of military movement without prior notification to UNAVEM III and of isolated attacks and ambushes against civilian and military targets alike , almost always resulting in a loss of human life . 
The text was based on General Assembly resolution 49 / 194 , with a few new provisions incorporated in the light of the Secretary-General 's proposals contained in his report on strengthening the rule of law ( A / 50 / 653 ) , including a provision on the need to mobilize additional resources for the Centre for Human Rights and , in particular , one relating to the Centre 's programme of advisory services and technical assistance , which had a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law . 
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production of , traffic in and distribution of drugs , arms and precursors and essential chemicals , which at times places them beyond the reach of the law , corrupting institutions , undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Genocide , aggression , systematic or mass violations of human rights , exceptionally serious war crimes , international terrorism and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs were covered in the draft ; those crimes represented the most serious breaches of the peace and security of mankind .  
In Habitat II , Governments at all levels , the community and the private sector considered how the achievement of the two principal goals of " Adequate shelter for all " and " Sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world " can be furthered at the local level through an enabling process in which individuals , families and their communities play a central role .  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
It will provide the basis for national and international action to reduce pollution of the oceans from land-based activities , contributing , inter alia , to : ( i ) improvement of coastal habitats and productivity ; ( ii ) reduction of threats to food security and safety ; ( iii ) reduction of hazards to human health ; and ( iv ) increased control over coastal activities to stop and reverse the process of alteration of the coastal zone .  
Calling the attention of the international community to the role of oceans and coastal areas as a major governing force of the planetary ecosystem , as well as a determining factor of human life , recommend that greater priority be accorded at national , regional and international levels to the action set out in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 ;  
To demonstrate to the world its capacity to act as a force for improving social and economic conditions and for promoting global development and human prosperity , the United Nations system should direct its efforts towards implementing the action-oriented recommendations of the Secretary-General , as outlined by him in An Agenda for Peace 19951 and An Agenda for Development 1995,2 as well as those of recent major international conferences .  
The sooner communities , local governments , partnerships among the public , and private and community sectors join efforts to create comprehensive , bold and innovative strategies for shelter and human settlements , the better the prospects will be for the safety , health and well-being of people and the brighter the outlook for solutions to global environment and social problems .  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
Moreover , not content with falsely accusing Iraq in the tenth preambular paragraph of summary executions , arbitrary detention and torture , with the sole aim of tarnishing the country 's reputation , the sponsors had neglected to mention the positive developments that had occurred in Iraq , including amnesties granted to prisoners and initiatives to strengthen democracy , pluralism and respect for human rights , such as the right to free speech .  
His delegation rejected the draft resolution , particularly the provisions concerning the deployment of human rights monitors throughout Iraqi territory , since those provisions violated the principles of national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States and might set an alarming precedent for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
Establish and implement consultative mechanisms among the governmental authorities that are responsible for economic , environmental , social , human settlements and shelter policies , and the organization of civil society and the private sector so as to coordinate the shelter sector in a coherent manner , which should include identifying the market and precise criteria for allocations , subsidies and other forms of assistance ;  
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
The empowerment of women and their full and equal participation in political , social and economic life , the improvement of health , and the alleviation of poverty are essential to achieving sustainable human settlements .  Paragraphs 10 and 10 bis should be joined as a single paragraph .  
These resolutions , inter alia , demanded that the Government of the Republic of Croatia respect fully the rights of the local Serb population in the former Sectors following Croatia 's military operations , including their rights to remain , leave or return in safety , take urgent measures to put an end to all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights and investigate all reports of such violations so that those responsible for such acts be judged and punished .  
We , the States participating in the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , [ , are committed to a political , economic , environmental , ethical and spiritual vision of human settlements based on the principles of equality , solidarity , partnership , human dignity , respect and cooperation .  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
We reaffirm that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social - are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated .  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
Sustainability of human settlements entails their balanced geographical distribution or other appropriate distribution in keeping with national conditions , the maintenance of biodiversity and cultural diversity , promotion of economic and social development , and human health and education , as well as air , water , vegetation and soil qualities at standards sufficient to sustain human life and well-being for all time .  NULL  
Partnerships among countries and among all actors within countries from public , private , voluntary , and community-based organizations , the cooperative sector , non-governmental organizations , and individuals are essential to the achievement of sustainable human settlements development and the provision of adequate shelter for all and basic services .  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
The living and working conditions in all human settlements , including regional urban centres , rural service centres , rural hamlets , rural communities , market towns and villages , must be improved , with particular emphasis on shelter , social and physical infrastructure , and services .  
Consistent with local needs and conditions , such efforts should include improving human settlements management , encouraging the sustainable development of intermediate cities that create employment opportunities for unemployed rural labour , and providing environmental infrastructure .  
Other key elements of a poverty reduction strategy include policies geared to [ reducing inequalities , increasing opportunities , and providing access to resources and income ; ] providing social protection for those who can not support themselves ; recognizing the special needs and skills of women ; developing human resource ; improving accessible infrastructure including communication facilities ; and [ taking comprehensive national responsibility for meeting ] the basic needs of all .  
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Ensure that clean water is available and accessible to all human settlements by the year 2000 through , inter alia , the adoption and improvement of technology , and ensure that environmental protection and conservation plans are designed and implemented to restore polluted water systems and rebuild damaged watersheds ;  
It combines the challenge of security for all the basic human need of a reliable supply of safe drinking water and meeting the competing demands from industry and agriculture , which are crucial to economic development and food security , without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their water needs .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
Promoting construction methods , materials and technologies that are affordable , safe , efficient and accessible and that emphasize greater use of local materials and human resources , that encourage and support design efficiency and energy-saving methods , and that are environmentally sound and protective of human health ;  
We commit ourselves to the goal of sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world by developing economies that will make efficient use of resources within the carrying capacity of ecosystems and by providing all people with equal opportunities for a healthy , safe and productive life in harmony with nature and their cultural heritage and spiritual and cultural values , thereby ensuring social progress .  
We commit ourselves to the strategy of enabling all key actors in the public , private and community sectors to play an effective role - at national , state / provincial , metropolitan , and local levels - in human settlements and shelter development .  
Stimulating national and local economies , through enabling competitive and sustainable economic development that will attract public and international financial resources and private investments , generate employment and increase revenues , providing a stronger financial base to support shelter and human settlements development ;  
The international community , including multilateral financial institutions , has an important role to play in providing additional resources to reinforce national efforts to foster an enabling environment so as to achieve the objectives of adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of human settlements .  
These approaches and frameworks should also include new and improved forms of cooperation and coordination between and among multilateral financial institutions , international organizations , and various organs and bodies of the United Nations system , including South-South , North-South and South-North exchanges of best practices , and the continuous development of tools and instruments for policy , planning and management such as the application of shelter and urban indicators , human resources development and institutional capacity-building . 145 bis .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support sustainable human settlements development .  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development among multilateral and bilateral donors and mobilizing their support for national , subregional and regional plans of action of developing countries , especially for interested beneficiary countries ;  
Achieving the agreed targets of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance , and 0.15 per cent of gross national product for assistance to the least developed countries , as soon as possible , and not later than the year 2000 , and increasing the share of funding for adequate shelter and human settlement development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Encouraging multilateral development institutions and donors to support nations in their effort to pursue enabling strategies through which national and local governments , communities and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in shelter and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Inviting multilateral and bilateral donors to support countries , particularly developing countries , in their efforts to pursue enabling strategies through which governments , local authorities , communities , and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in the provision of adequate shelter , including social housing and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Striving to enhance the effectiveness of existing official development assistance and other external financial flows through improving coordination between and among donors and the United Nations operational activities , and through better coherence between those flows and internal sustainable human settlements strategies ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
Developing innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for human settlements development and creating a supportive environment for the mobilization of resources by civil society , including beneficiary and individual voluntary contributions ;  
Implementing the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of human settlements in the small island developing States , in particular by providing effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for human settlements programmes , in accordance with the Declaration of Barbados and on the basis of relevant provisions of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
There is a need for a better coordinated institutional approach to provide comprehensive scientific , technical and economic assessments of the major human activities contributing to atmospheric modification .  
The resources available for applied climate science are already far from adequate and the increased involvement of the socio-economic research community in developing and understanding human influences on atmospheric processes is expected to call for substantial increase in funding over the next decade .  
Harvesting of priority products , especially in developed countries , was frequently combined with the provision of selected environmental services ( notably maintenance of the biological resource base , including the wildlife and the conservation of soil and water ) and , with efforts to enhance recreation and aesthetic values of forests and woodlands for an increasingly urbanized human population .  
The FAO / ITTO Expert Meeting noted that , among others , arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and the Near East had not received attention under the international initiatives related to the identification of criteria and indicators ; and that the environmental conditions and socio-economic needs governing forest management in these areas in which forestry played an essential role in the survival and sustenance of local human populations , was likely to require special , complementary or additional considerations not evident in ongoing initiatives .  
The low priority assigned to forestry in national development plans results in low budget allocations in comparison to needs , and is reflected in lack of technical capability , human resources , extension facilities , basic data / information , and administrative efficiency . 
Unique or rare forest ecosystems that are not comprised of significant numbers of endemic species are more likely to be found in areas that previously had more continuous forest cover but in which forest cover has been fragmented and reduced relatively recently ( in evolutionary terms ) by climatic change , human influence or a combination of the two .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
In obtaining evidence for the verification of this commitment , the Mission faces the persistence , characteristic of Guatemala , of large numbers of homicides , death threats , kidnappings and other serious crimes which , because they are committed by ordinary criminals or unidentified persons , are not recorded as human rights violations which are directly attributable to agents of the State or politically motivated , but are nevertheless a result of the State 's failure in its duty to provide guarantees and to prevent , investigate and punish crime . 
Experience has served to design a comprehensive project for the dissemination of and education in human and indigenous rights , through integrated mass public information campaigns that use media and messages tailored to the population 's socio-economic and cultural context and give particular importance to the multi-ethnic nature of Guatemala .  
Threats and intimidation continued to be directed against individuals and entities working for the protection of human rights by CVDC members and former military commissioners in rural areas and by unidentified groups operating in urban areas .  
Although only the Government can put most of these commitments into effect , URNG , in addition to recognizing the need to put an end to the suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , also undertook , inter alia , " to respect the inherent attributes of the human person and to contribute to the effective enjoyment of human rights " ( Comprehensive Agreement , fourth preambular paragraph ) .  
Encourages the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to request the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 8 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-second session ;  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to ensure , from within existing resources , that the revision of the United Nations Manual on Human Rights Reporting is completed as soon as possible , that the revised manual is available in all official languages at the earliest opportunity and that due regard is paid to the recommendations concerning the manual made by the fifth meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies ;  
Considering that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;  
Now , after the incidents , we hear expressions of regret for the loss of human lives , but the painful reality is that , at a time when the pirate air incursions could have been discouraged , prohibited and stopped by those capable of doing so , the repeated warnings were ignored , and some quarters even applauded these irresponsible adventures .  
Welcoming the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
They reflect a recognition of the need to move away from the treatment of fields of international law ( relating , for example , to human rights , economic relations , environmental protection ) as being self-contained , towards the development of general rules of international law in which those separate fields retain their distinct character but are subject to an interconnected approach .  
This continuing rise in anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases poses potentially substantial risks to global physical and ecological systems , human health and socio-economic sectors .  
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in section V .  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
The Centre is developing a technical assistance and advisory programme aimed at assisting China in building the necessary administrative and legal structures in the area of criminal law and criminal justice in accordance with democratic principles and respect for human rights .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and , in some cases , inadequate access to technologies , may all hinder implementation and compliance .  
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
The Assembly , concerned by the continuing reports of grave abuses committed against these women migrant workers , which impair or nullify their enjoyment of their human rights , requested the inter-agency meeting preceding the regular session of the Commission on the Status of Women to consider this problem .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Recalling further that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Also urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Recalling further the pertinent resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights condemning the flagrant violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , including its most recent , resolution 1995 / 76 of 8 March 1995 , [ 4 ] / by which the Commission extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq for a further year and requested him to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session and a final report to the Commission at its fifty-second session ,  
In this programme the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa ( UNU / INRA ) addresses the continent 's urgent needs for human resources development and institutional capacity-building in order to achieve more effective conservation , management and rational utilization of natural resources for sustainable development .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
The report will highlight important findings announced at the London meeting , viz . , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominantly cereal diets of most developing countries .  
Welcoming the results of the first Round-Table Conference of Donors , held at Brussels from 25 to 27 September 1995 , conducted in a spirit of reconciliation and intended to mobilize funds for the Community Rehabilitation and National Reconciliation Programme , and aware of the important role to be played by the international community in assisting Angola in rehabilitating its economy and its basic and social infrastructures , as well as the development of human resources ,  
Considering that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
The specific topics under the theme " Capacity-building in public administration " were the enhancement of policy development capacity , organizational strengthening , improved civil service systems , the strengthening of financial management for development , human resource development for the public sector , and the development of administrative capacities for post-conflict and crisis conditions .  
For nearly 50 years , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has actively supported technical cooperation areas of administrative restructuring and reform , human resource development , institutional building in training areas , resource mobilization , financial management and the improved performance of public enterprises .  
From 1980 emphasis has been placed on the role of the public sector in promoting the economic development of developing countries , with auxiliary activities concentrating on the role of qualified national personnel in the social and economic development of developing countries , and specialized topics such as the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade , the development of human resources , or United Nations programmes of action for African economic recovery and development .  
In seeking a common standard of achievement for all people and all countries in the area of human rights , the World Conference on Human Rights , held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 , called upon all nations , regions and the international community to create favourable conditions for and effective enjoyment of basic human rights .  
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .  
In order to strengthen institutional capacity-building and human resource development in the public sector , developing countries and countries with economies in transition should avail themselves of the mechanisms of technical cooperation among developing countries and of triangular cooperation , in which developed countries and international organizations should play a catalytic role .  
The immediate strategy would include the assessment of national absorptive capacities , human and capital ; the definition of policy issues and drafting of national policies ; the restructuring and operation of key ministries for implementation of the defined policies ; the restoration of management systems and tools ( e.g . , personnel , audit , information ) ; the restoration and management of justice and public safety systems ; the retention and enlistment of professional human resources ; and the provision of crash training and retraining programmes .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
Also gravely concerned at reports , including by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; forced displacement of persons ; enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; and denial of the freedoms of expression , association and peaceful assembly ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Recognizing further that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
13 Insufficient human and financial resources and limited administrative capacities and logistical infrastructure contributed to the low absorptive capacity characteristic of several States of the region , and to a level of activities lower than that envisaged by UNDCP .  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
As the Mission approaches full deployment and with the operations of the logistic support service contract , emphasis was given to the strengthening of selected areas of administration and integrated support services to ensure optimum efficiency in the utilization of human resources and the timely provision of services to military and civilian personnel .  
The course covers the protection of the human rights of women in all pertinent areas , encompassing civil , political , economic and social rights , as well as relevant issues of humanitarian law .  
The Council recognized that it continued to be a widespread international activity frequently involving highly organized international syndicates that trafficked in human cargo without regard to the dangerous and inhumane conditions to which they were subjected , and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards .  
Reaffirming General Assembly resolutions 50 / 173 of 22 December 1995 on the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education , 1995-2004 , and 49 / 184 of 23 December 1994 , in which the Assembly expressed the conviction that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social [ and of the right to development ] , 5 ter preambular paragraph .  
The Commission should be provided with a mandate under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations enabling it to carry out a thorough investigation and receive the full cooperation of members of the international community implicated in alleged violations of the embargo , so as to send a strong signal to all arms dealers of the world and their governmental supporters that they can not supply arms to a genocidal organization benefiting from the abuse of human rights with impunity ;  
The Governments recognized the sovereign right and legitimate interest of each country to safeguard its boundaries and to enforce its own immigration laws , always observing strict respect for the human rights of the migrants , as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and other relevant international instruments , irrespective of their nationality , race , age , religion , sex or immigration status . 
Using the vision of sustainable human development contained in the Five Goals of the National Constitution as the framework for its work , the mission analysed the major environment and development issues facing Papua New Guinea under the three broad headings of enabling government , managing Papua New Guinea 's resources and empowering people for effective participation and integral human development .  
The Governing Council of UNDP , at its thirty-eighth session ( 1991 ) , adopted comprehensive legislation , in keeping with General Assembly resolution 44 / 211 on the comprehensive triennial policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , that put forth new initiatives relating to the national execution of technical cooperation activities , and the development of projects according to an integrated and prioritized national programme , and placed renewed emphasis on human development and capacity-building in development activities .  
It is understandable that the restoration of such confidence may be impeded by the deep wounds and distrust left by the conflict at the individual human level as well as by current political calculations .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
We consider such blockade and closure as tantamount to the declaration of a state of war against the Palestinian people , a people that have chosen the road of peace but that for more than a month have been subjected to the worst and most unjust form of collective punishment , to say nothing of the starvation of children , women and the elderly and contempt for basic rights that should be respected in the same manner as human rights in all countries of the world . 
In conveying to you once again our pride in and deep appreciation for your dedicated and constructive efforts and the conspicuous and honourable positions you have taken in support of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people , I am hopeful that your worthy endeavours will be crowned with success so that we may achieve the desired peace based on justice , equality and respect for human rights . 
These policy options will endeavour to link land and water management issues ; water for food security ; and safe drinking water supply , sanitation and sewerage and human health in the context of economic and social development .  NULLThe report will be supplemented by commissioned studies on the economic aspects of sustainable water resources development and use and gender issues , as well as a study on the relationship between water resources and growing urbanization and a study on cooperative approaches to the development of shared river basins .  
The two strategies followed by Mexico in this field were as follows : ( a ) establishing channels for communication of intelligence and information that would make it possible to expand the knowledge base in each country and to enhance the process of communication with countries that possessed more advanced techniques ; and ( b ) international cooperation in combating criminal activities that frustrated the efforts of Governments to fulfil their commitment to promote human rights , fundamental freedoms and democratic decision-making .  
The transportation sector is of considerable interest not only because of its importance as a source of greenhouse gas emissions but also because of the effects on human health and the environment associated with other pollutants and a number of other issues , such as traffic accidents , congestion , noise , impeded access to cities , competition for land use and restricted access of the poor to basic services - problems that are of increasing importance in developing countries .  
Full account had to be taken of economic conditions ; social , ethnic , cultural , religious or legal situations ; conjugal circumstances ; the nature and type of relations characterized by violence ; and conditions of political persecution , social oppression , racial discrimination and unequal economic development , as well as violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
50 To this definition , the Platform for Action additionally includes the violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , in particular , murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; forced sterilization and forced abortion , coercive / forced use of contraceptives , female infanticide and prenatal sex selection .  
To the extent that hazardous wastes exported to developing countries result in the contamination of soil and adjacent waters , they may reduce future productivity and economic uses of those natural resources , besides endangering human , animal and plant life .  
Stressing the importance of an efficient and effective public sector as the basic framework for stable and sustainable institutional and human development in all countries ,  
Invites the international community to recognize the importance of the role of public administration and governance in sustainable human development and the maintenance of peace and stability , and to provide adequate resources for programmes of assistance for improving public administration in developing countries , countries with economies in transition and countries facing special circumstances ;  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 137 on human rights in the administration of justice , called attention to such standards and norms , and recommended that the establishment of a comprehensive programme within the system of advisory services and technical assistance be considered in order to help States in the task of building and strengthening adequate national structures that had a direct impact on the overall observance of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law .  
The proper functioning of the law enforcement agencies is essential not only to an effective criminal justice policy , but also to the underlying premise of the protection of the fundamental human rights of individuals .  
Member States were invited to accord priority to the practical implementation of standards relating to human rights in the administration of justice , to incorporate into their national legislation and practice existing standards in this field , to design realistic and effective mechanisms for the full implementation of those standards , and to provide the necessary administrative and judicial structures for their continuous monitoring .  
The Police Congress , which was attended by representatives of 33 police agencies from 27 countries , included debates on the following topics : ( a ) human resources , a competitive advantage in modern police operations ; ( b ) economic crime ; ( c ) terrorism : a strategy for its neutralization ; ( d ) information : its positive and / or negative effect on security and crime ; and ( e ) drug abuse and its incidence among children and youth .  
It stressed the need to assist States in the task of building and strengthening adequate structures through technical assistance to national projects in reforming penal and correctional establishments , in education and training of lawyers , judges and security forces in human rights , and in other specific spheres of activity relevant to the good functioning of the rule of law .  
96 Paragraph 233 ( d ) calls upon Governments and non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and other institutional organizations , to include , as appropriate , " information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected " .  
According to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , the term " discrimination against women " is used to denote all forms of discrimination , deprivation and restriction that prevents or eliminates or aims to prevent or eliminate the recognition , utilization and benefiting of women from all political , economic , social , cultural , civil and other fundamental rights and freedoms of human beings as based on the equality of the sexes and regardless of their civil status .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Unless a new agricultural revolution is envisaged in the near future that would radically reduce the amount of water consumed in food production in hot countries ( currently about 3,000 cubic metres per ton of grain produced ) , it must be acknowledged as an urgent matter that there seems to be a definite limit to the human population that can be supported by the available water-supply . 
The mission further recommended that Member States should be encouraged to support intensive and sustained efforts to develop a broad-based and independent media in Burundi as an essential complement to diplomatic , humanitarian , human rights and development efforts already under way .  
The Board recognizes that the transportation and provision of controlled drugs needed for humanitarian aid in acute emergencies of natural or human origin constitute a genuine justification for non-application of the normal , regular control requirements .  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .  The above included reports on population , urbanization and quality of life ; strengthening of regional activities ; urban and housing indicators ; building materials and health ; and human settlements and environmental strategies .  
Special attention was given to the building and effective utilization of critical human , institutional and infrastructural capacities , particularly in the production , trade , monetary and financial , and physical infrastructure fields , as well as for the enhancement of public and private sector development and management .  
A reorientation of the activities of the human settlements sector , which resulted in major changes leading to the consolidation and reduction of activities relating to technical aspects of human settlements , which were addressed in the past , in favour of activities that better complement other activities undertaken by the three other leading sections responsible for the implementation of activities that focus more on improving the quality of life from several angles ;  
To create awareness of emerging human settlement policy issues arising from major global economic , social and environmental trends , in particular those arising from urbanization through the dissemination of successful and promising practices ;  
To strengthen international cooperation in the development and implementation of human settlement policies striving towards environmental , economic and social soundness and sustainable development ; monitor and analyse results in the implementation process ; coordinate those policies with overall national sustainable development objectives ; and build institutional capacity and professional know-how ;  
To identify new and emerging trends in the ecological , economic , social , technical and legislative spheres that influence sustainable human settlements development in the ECE region ;  
Notwithstanding the fact that issues pertaining to the improvement of the quality of life are indivisible and interdependent and will , therefore , be addressed in an interdisciplinary manner in so far as possible , the subprogramme , which is implemented by the Social Development Issues and Policies Division , will seek to achieve objectives related to four specific yet complementary areas pertaining to the improvement of the quality of life : population , human development , advancement of women and human settlements .  
While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
The abuse of drugs and alcohol is an intrinsic threat to such basic goals as economic and social well-being , fundamental human rights and social justice , constructive development , adequate employment and satisfactory conditions of work and pay .  
Society 's assigned roles and perceptions also play a part in the way men and women are involved in illicit trafficking ; are vulnerable to punitive actions from the law enforcement sectors ; are subject to human rights violations ; and are perceived in the community .  
Promoting effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
To that end , the objective is to enhance the capability of the Governments of the region to formulate and implement policies and actions to strengthen the technological dimension of productive activities , increase competitiveness , eliminate bottlenecks in the key factor markets - mainly in the area of human resources , physical capital and export promotion policies - and stimulate entrepreneurial development ;  
The objective is to contribute towards a better understanding of the conditions and trends in human settlements in the region and to support countries in establishing balanced and integrated human settlement systems , improving housing , infrastructure and services and instituting proper management of the urban process .  
The tasks identified by the Secretary-General included availability and management of water , sustainable food security , capacity - building for governance , social and human development and mobilization of external and internal financial resources for African development .  
For the underprivileged of the world , there is greater awareness of the situation in the developed countries , resulting in raised aspirations and calls in global forums for goals and standards regarding increased prosperity , a secure and healthy life , human rights , social justice and gender equality . 
An appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies , a well-developed infrastructure , strengthened institutions and capacity , as well as meeting basic human needs such as shelter , and providing social welfare , were recognized as key factors for addressing the poverty problem .  
The representative of the Centre explained the primary goal and objectives of the five-year project : to help the organization better meet the current and diverse demands placed on it in matters relating to peace and security and humanitarian and human rights affairs ; to help the United Nations system to meet the new and dramatic challenges of the future ; to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the system partners ; and to help the United Nations organization to meet the calls for reform , accountability and flexibility .  
The Acting Director noted that this limited the Institute 's ability to provide the other main committees of the General Assembly with substantive contributions and conclusions derived from its research in crucial areas of economic and social development , such as water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , alleviation of poverty , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
The overall orientation of the programme , which is under the responsibility of the Department for Development Support and Management Services , is to enhance and support , through technical cooperation , the national efforts of Member States , in particular developing countries and the least developed among them , as well as economies in transition , to build their human and institutional capabilities and infrastructures to formulate and effectively implement economic and social policies that will contribute to sustainable , people-centred development and the eradication of poverty .  
To assist Governments , at their request , in strengthening their capacity for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , human resources development and public administration training ; improving performance in the public sector ; increasing public / private sector interaction ; managing development programmes ; and enhancing government legal capacity ;  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
The organization shall be concerned with matters falling within the competence of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies with respect to international economic , social , environmental , cultural , educational , health , scientific , technological and related matters and to humanitarian and human rights questions .

Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
The programme is based on the principles of the Vienna Declaration , including the principle that democracy , development and respect for human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated and must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , universally , objectively and non-selectively .  
A significant enhancement and strengthening of international cooperation in the field of human rights leading to increased effectiveness of international machinery , improved respect of human rights at the national level , through , inter alia , universal ratification of basic international human rights treaties and the incorporation of those standards into the domestic legislation of States ;  
At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that the concept of development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional undertaking with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition .  
We , the Heads of State or Government and the official delegations of countries assembled at the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in Istanbul , Turkey from 3 to 14 June 1996 , take this opportunity to endorse the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more livable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
Our deliberations on the two major themes of the Conference - adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world - have been inspired by the Charter of the United Nations and are aimed at reaffirming existing and forging new partnerships for action at the international , national and local levels to improve our living environment .  
To this end , we commit ourselves to improving the living conditions in human settlements in ways that are consonant with local needs and realities , and we acknowledge the need to address the global , economic , social and environmental trends to ensure the creation of better living environments for all people . 
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .  
The agreement represents a model for national reconciliation ; it offers the prospect of building a pluralistic democratic society with high standards in the sphere of the human rights and equal participation of all political and regional forces in the public life of the country .  
In order to support the new global and integrated approach to human rights based on the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which emphasized the interrelated and interdependent nature of all human rights , it will be necessary to organize both short-term and long-term training in the various dimensions of human rights to ensure that all staff and those joining the Programme enjoy a broad knowledge of human rights from the United Nations perspective .  
Technical advisory services were provided by the Group on a variety of development issues , covering such areas as : inland water transport ; subregional cooperation for lake basin development ; implementation of the African Platform for Action on Women ; formulation of development priorities , programmes and projects ; economic cooperation and integration ; human resources development and utilization , and energy development ; criminal justice and crime prevention ; mineral resources and development ; agricultural development ; rural development ; industrial development ; and science and technology development . 
Furthermore , ESCWA published the biennial demographic and related socio-economic indicators on human development and socio-cultural specificity - the case of the Arab world ; the social dimensions of human development ; the situation of disabled women , their marginalization , and measures for social integration in the ESCWA region ; changing values in the Arab family ; and regional perspectives of human settlements in ESCWA countries .  
A more systematic and sustained process of building and nurturing national human and institutional capacities is required , tailored to each country 's strengths and weaknesses , to help integrate the different dimensions of development , including that of economic and social rights , and to design , manage and execute complex programmes and projects .  
In the first half of 1996 , more than 550 policemen received training in the following areas : advanced driving , basic forensic science , drug law enforcement , human rights , maintenance of public order , management development and training , and management training for traffic police and women police management .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
The humanitarian community will have to consider how it will relate in the future to global economic and social adjustments , to environmental and ecological concerns , and to human rights .  
According to both foreign observers and residents , the leading causes of continuing lawlessness in the region are the lack of an adequate professional police presence and the Croatian authorities ' unwillingness to take firm preventive action against human rights violators .  
The figures provided by the Government are thus unclear on the specific issue raised by the Security Council in its presidential statement of 23 February 1996 , namely , the issue of prosecutions against those suspected of past violations of international humanitarian law and human rights against the local Serb minority . 
This high level of attrition at a stage when continuing learning is both optimal and desirable represents , from an educational and manpower planning perspective , a wasted national opportunity to expand and strengthen the human resource pool for the enhancement of national productivity .  
The Counsel for Human Rights , with support from the Mission , has elaborated a work plan for his programme on behalf of indigenous peoples which seeks to : ( a ) put an end to discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples and individuals ; ( b ) guarantee the practical enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and ( c ) promote respect for and recognition and promotion of the historical and specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
Notwithstanding the above , the Government 's compliance with the commitment to supporting and strengthening institutions for the protection of human rights is still highly inadequate , as shown by the absence or weak presence of such institutions in wide areas of the country and the fact that the bodies responsible for implementing this commitment lack a comprehensive policy in criminal matters .  
The Mission is deeply concerned at the continuation of this practice , which , given the army 's historic influence over such committees , undermines the primacy of civilian authority and also affects the human rights situation , in that members of the voluntary civil defence committees and former military commissioners are implicated in numerous complaints of human rights violations .  
The Mission considers that the deterioration of the conditions in which defendants are held pending trial , and the lengthening of sentences , could have a generalized adverse impact on the protection of individuals against the arbitrary use of State power , while paradoxically failing to achieve the declared aim of protecting the human rights of crime victims .  
Adopt , within its sphere of competence , a set of measures to enable the Public Prosecutor 's Office to play the role assigned to it , with a view to : ( i ) establishing hierarchical supervision over the National Police and other security forces ; ( ii ) preventing interference from other State entities in the Office 's work ; ( iii ) providing the necessary institutional support to prosecutors who are responsible for cases involving human rights violations ; and ( iv ) protecting the physical integrity of the Office 's personnel ;

With regard to the religious and ethnic violence prompted by the failure of the Indonesian Government to resolve the social , political and economic issues that lay at the heart of the human rights problems , three major riots had taken place in 1995 .  The first and last had been sparked by deliberate acts of incitement against Catholicism , the dominant religion in East Timor .  
The attending Heads of State and Government had received a delegation of the Coordinating Committee of the Diplomatic Front for Timorese Resistance and had reiterated that they were ready to promote concerted action to guarantee respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in East Timor and a just , comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution that would achieve respect for the legitimate rights and aspirations of its people in conformity with international law .  
The European Union is of the view that these objectives are attainable through a strengthened political dialogue to be held on a regular basis , through the development of financial and economic cooperation and by granting a more important role to the social , human and cultural dimensions of this dialogue .  
When confronted with the task of placing the importance of the two questions in proper perspective , it is obvious to us that human life is the supreme value which we must protect , just as we must protect the security of civil aviation in this case , by defending and reiterating the applicable norms of international law .  
These incursive and cruel activities which resulted in numerous human casualties and material damages to civilian population constitute a grave violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran .  
This inspiring philosophy required a holistic institution : an organization mandated with responsibility for distinct yet interconnected areas of human activity and the safeguard of agreed and fundamental principles of international behaviour .  
In view of the small size constraint faced by many island developing countries , special efforts should be made to promote regional cooperation arrangements that offer a viable framework for realizing economies of scale in various economic activities , particularly with regard to resource exploitation , protection and policing of coast lines and exclusive economic zones , environmental protection , market access , development and sharing of human resources , expansion of inter-island feeder services , tourism development and exchange of information on successes and failures in various areas of development .

It includes information on women and human rights , women and political participation , gender-based violence , women and armed conflict , reproductive rights and sexual rights , culture and traditional practices , the girl child , women 's rights in relation to children 's rights , and legal status versus legal reality . 
The report highlights important findings announced at the London meeting , namely , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominately cereal diets of most developing countries .  
A training programme for members of human rights organizations included short seminars on human rights investigation , forensic anthropology and judicial reform , as well as a two-week intensive course on various aspects of human rights work .  Seminars for journalists were held in all Haiti 's principal towns .  
A major regional project covering 26 countries in eastern Europe and CIS was launched in 1995 and executed by ECE to assist national statistical offices in developing the human resources necessary for building self-sustainable capabilities for the collection , processing and analysis of reliable social and demographic statistics , and enabling the appropriate governmental institutions and agencies of these countries to monitor the social aspects of development .

Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
The human rights situation in Burundi is characterized by large-scale massacres involving both State agents and rebels ; selective murders of intellectuals , political leaders , provincial officials and Hutu merchants , as well as certain Tutsi military officers alleged to be moderates ; arbitrary arrests ; and enforced disappearances .  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious intercommunity relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , [ in the framework of their beliefs ] * Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women and the girl child . 
We agree to support ongoing and new creative partnerships , recognizing that indigenous people , youth and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups possess in common the potential for diverse realization of full human development .  
In the spirit of cooperative linkages for joint exploration of human potentials , we agree to focus on partnership actions that clarify , interpret , create , protect and promote socio-legal , political , economic , educational , cultural , moral and spiritual processes affecting the abilities of indigenous people and youth to choose , maintain , access , encourage , manage and actualize their diverse ways of achieving just and humane growth and development .  
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
No one fully knows how deep and friendly are the relations that link the Egyptian people with the Sudanese people : their ties are as old as the Nile , are enhanced by geographical proximity , neighbourly relations , a common language , the similarity of their social customs and the human relations between the two peoples in the Nile valley since time immemorial .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Massive or persistent violations of human rights , often the result of ethnic , racial or religious tensions or unequal access to power and basic necessities of life will continue to endanger international peace and security and to hamper economic and social development .  
Although Africa is faced with enormous problems , it also has a great potential , both in human and natural resources , for sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
The accords , commitments and internationally agreed targets reached at United Nations global conferences and United Nations organs , in the multifaceted and interrelated issues of the environment , population , social development , crime , the advancement of women , human settlements , trade and development and public administration should be fully implemented by all States and international organizations .  
In the United Nations human rights programme of assistance , priority will be given to establishing criteria and implementing procedures for promoting economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , to exploring the root causes of human rights violations , to protecting the rights of persons who can be particularly vulnerable to abuse or neglect , including youth , persons with disabilities , the elderly and migrant workers .  
The United Nations will promote necessary measures to strengthen laws , policies and programmes that would ensure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life as equal partners and the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all women .  
The objectives of the review were to determine whether the management structure of the civilian component was appropriate in providing the necessary support service to UNPF , to assess the adequacy of management systems and internal controls and to ascertain whether the use of United Nations resources ( human , physical and financial ) was adequately planned , organized , directed and monitored , and whether value for money was achieved .  
Welcoming also the continued efforts by States to provide humanitarian assistance and technical cooperation to the people of Haiti , Supporting fully the contribution of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti and the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti in the establishment of a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the full observance of human rights and the full restoration of the constitutional democracy of Haiti , and encouraging the International Civilian Mission to continue to cooperate with the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti and others participating in institution-building , including police training activities ,

In the face of this paralysing economic strangulation , decreed unilaterally by our neighbours , which should be cultivating natural human solidarity more than ever with a Burundi immersed in a state of distress , we are once again threatened with genocide , the causes of which everyone is seeking to eradicate , but which could re-emerge owing to those measures that run counter to legal and humanitarian principles .  
Likewise , it is essential to study , starting now , all the necessary modalities for resuming development aid once peace , national reconciliation , democracy and strict respect for human rights have become established and have finally triumphed , both in the thinking and in the conduct of all the citizens of Burundi , who will finally be brought together and will coalesce into a single , unified nation .  
In this regard , on Friday , 23 August , the Government published a statement in which it invites the entire international community , starting with Amnesty International , to immediately begin investigations of this monstrous allegation by the representative of Amnesty International in Burundi .  Today I received a copy of a message sent by the Government of Burundi to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , inviting them to increase the number of human rights observers , since the current Government ,  
During its sixteenth session , in January 1996 , the Council decided to give priority , in its future activities , to regional and subregional projects , and reaffirmed its support of projects aiming , in particular at improving the quality of communication for development ; promoting freedom of the press , pluralism and independence of the media ; promoting democracy and human rights ; supporting activities for broader participation of women in the media ; and developing community media etc .  
In another sense , however , the distinction between relief and rehabilitation assistance in Somalia is becoming increasingly blurred , as the main underlying causes of human suffering and emergency needs remain the population 's lack of purchasing power and employment opportunities combined with the absence of civil and social infrastructure and institutions of governance .  
Drug abuse has devastating social effects , including its harmful impact on youth , families , other social groups and the workplace , and adverse health consequences as well , including those resulting from the relationship between substance abuse and a number of major diseases and disorders and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) .  
The Conference also decided that in the area of international trade , the UNCTAD technical cooperation programme should focus , inter alia , on enhancing institutional and human capacities in order for developing countries to analyse new and emerging issues and to benefit from the opportunities arising from participation in the multilateral trading system and to comply with the obligations in this respect .  
The programme on education for peace , human rights , democracy and international understanding provided a meaningful contribution to the struggle against terrorism inasmuch as it promoted thinking and behaviour based on common humanistic and cultural values .  
Difficulties developed and delays again occurred in a number of areas , including the institutional consolidation of the public security sector ; the adoption of legal and constitutional reforms ; the reform of the judicial and electoral systems ; the transfer of land to former combatants ; and the transfer of rural human settlements to their current occupants .

In view of the politico-economic environment in which well over half the 1995 expenditure was incurred , it is still considered that the additional resources , both human and financial , which would be required to analyse and forecast the inflation and exchange rate variation factors with any degree of reliability would be costly to UNHCR , the degree of reliability would most probably not be reached , and the added value to UNHCR would most probably be minimal .  
It has maintained close relations with the administrative , judicial and military authorities at local and national levels , and has reported its assessment of the human rights situation to the Government on a regular basis .  
In recent experience , some peacekeeping operations have been mandated to include different combinations of the following tasks : monitoring of cease-fires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , demining , establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
" The use of chemicals is essential to protect public health and increase food production , but unregulated use of toxic chemicals or uncontrolled disposal of hazardous wastes threaten the environment and human health " In the second sentence , before the words " monitor and assess global trends " insert the words " through the work of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal , " ;  
Some delegations felt that the development of new norms and new standards and instruments mentioned in paragraphs 19.2 and 19.3 ( n ) was not an appropriate goal , and that the universal ratification of basic international human rights treaties mentioned in paragraph 19.3 ( a ) represented goals which were too ambitious and difficult to be realized during the plan period .  
The objective of eradicating absolute poverty required a broad range of policies and actions at all levels : an appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies ; a well-developed infrastructure ; strengthened institutions and capacity ; as well as programmes designed to meet basic human needs ;  
The project will assist Governments and regional institutions in strengthening capability for monitoring and analysing climate and sea level trends ; identify areas vulnerable to the effects of climate change and sea level rise ; develop an integrated management and planning framework ; enhance regional and national capabilities through human resource development and institutional strengthening ; identify and assess policy operations and instruments ; and collect information for preparing national communications .  
This series of global conferences have proved invaluable in raising awareness of human and environmental conditions around the world and in enjoining national Governments and the international community to act to improve those conditions .  
Having set out , in a number of principles and commitments , guidelines for making settlements healthier , safer , more humane and sustainable , the Habitat Agenda then proposes a comprehensive set of objectives and actions , based on two themes : ( a ) adequate shelter for all and ( b ) sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
On the basis of an analysis of existing national plans , the broadest demand for technical assistance and cooperation in the follow-up to Habitat II is likely to be in institutional development , capacity-building and facilitation / enablement , with emphasis on the following components of effective governance for sustainable human settlements : legal frameworks and institutional structures , consultative and participatory processes , research and policy development , planning processes , management systems , financing modalities , training systems , information systems , communication networks , and technology transfer processes .  
It will be recalled that , following the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements , held in Vancouver , British Columbia , in 1976 , and deriving from its recommendations , a consensus developed on the need for institutional arrangements to provide a focal point within the United Nations system to promote and support a concerted and systematic effort by the international community for human settlements development .  
Noting the intention of the Secretary-General to ensure effective coordination of the implementation of the Habitat Agenda and adequate consideration of human settlements needs in all activities of the United Nations system , and to include the implementation of the Habitat Agenda in the agenda of the ACC machinery , and in the mandates of the thematic task forces that are promoting an integrated and coordinated follow-up , at the inter-agency level , of the outcomes of recent global conferences .  I , resolution 1 , annex II .  
The proposed project is also concerned with achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable social and human development ; reproductive health including family planning and sexual health ; and gender sensitivity and women 's empowerment .  
The Special Rapporteur has maintained and continues to maintain that mercenaries exist ; that they are not a small number of individuals ; that they are groups of professionals selling their skill in war and violence ; that they are also criminal organizations , an international blight in their perpetration of acts of violence which ruin human lives , create material losses , hamper economic activity and extend to terrorist attacks that have touched off or aggravated conflicts , with often catastrophic results for the peoples affected by them . 
The following thematic areas were considered at the meeting : ( a ) policy development capacity and administrative restructuring , civil service reform and management training ; ( b ) financial management ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) public-private interaction ; ( e ) public sector efficiency ; ( f ) social development ; ( g ) infrastructure and the environment ; ( h ) legal and regulatory framework ; ( i ) post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery ; and ( j ) management of development programmes .  
In accordance with Council resolution 1985 / 17 , the Committee has 18 members who are experts with recognized competence in the field of human rights , serving in their personal capacity , due consideration being given to equitable geographical distribution and to the representation of different forms of social and legal systems ; to this end , 15 seats are equally distributed among the regional groups , while the additional 3 seats are allocated in accordance with the increase in the total number of States parties per regional group .  
To promote awareness , both in developed and in developing countries , of the social , economic and environmental implications of national and international population problems , of the human rights aspects of family planning , and of possible strategies to deal with them , in accordance with the plans and priorities of each country ;  
Considering the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations calling , inter alia , for the promotion of international cooperation in solving problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms ,  
In fact , his real reasons for presenting such a report are political , and completely unrelated to human rights issues ; rather , they are connected with the conspiracy to divide Iraq by imposing the no-fly zones in the north and the south of the country .  
Van der Stoel attempts to invoke the issue of missing Kuwaitis for obvious political purposes unrelated to human rights with a view to the continued exercise of pressure on the Government of Iraq and prolongation of the economic embargo and hence the suffering of the Iraqi people .  
Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations . [ 1 ] / United Nations , Treaty Series , vol .  520 , No . 7515 .  
Danish development policy is an integral part of Danish foreign policy , in which the main objectives are , inter alia : promotion of common security , promotion of democratic government and human rights , creation of economic and social development and ensuring ecologically sustainable development .  
In addition to promoting mutual understanding and solidarity through cultural cooperation between peoples , the assistance aims at creating equal and free opportunities for the individual , in accordance with the aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , the development of human resources and the respect of the individual , as well as the creation of pluralistic civil societies .  
While all those procedural aspects are covered in a special chapter ( comprising a number of articles ) in other principal human rights treaties , in the case of the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which does not have a treaty-based standing , more than a dozen Council resolutions and decisions were needed to complement the text of the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . Owing to this special " legal " situation , a decision by the Council could terminate the Committee 's existence .  
Such an action is explicitly called for by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action 2 / which in its paragraph I . 5 reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ;  
Having reviewed the steps taken towards the implementation of General Assembly resolutions 50 / 145 and 50 / 146 , including other relevant mandates in this area , it can be concluded that the credibility of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme will be measured , to a large extent , by its ability to provide effective support to requesting countries in drafting legislation , creating independent systems for the administration of justice , establishing police forces that are respectful of the rule of law and setting up national institutions for protecting fundamental human rights .  
In this , the political leadership is also obliged to support and foster the development of both the formal human rights institutions that were established by the Peace Agreement and Federation Constitutions , and the informal non-governmental structures that are an integral part of the development of civil society .  
The political leadership now has the opportunity to ensure that , in particular through the functioning of common institutions at the national level , all three communities can work towards the consolidation of a sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law , respect for the human rights of all peoples and the development of a representative democracy .  
The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .  
It is the obligation of Governments to carry out exhaustive and impartial investigations into allegations of violations of the right to life , to identify , bring to justice and punish their perpetrators , to grant compensation to the victims or their families , and to take effective measures to avoid future recurrence of such violations .  The Special Rapporteur has noted that impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of violations of human rights , and , in particular , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
However , it would be unfair to put the rebel groups , no matter what their role in the violence has been , on the same footing as a State which has ratified the major international instruments on human rights and international humanitarian law and is therefore bound by strict obligations . 
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
In its resolution 50 / 58 K , the General Assembly expressed its concern , inter alia , that Burundi continued to face a social and political crisis , the adverse consequences of which were manifest in human rights abuses , the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and external trade and shrinking public revenue .  
Experience in countries that have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which pay attention to the distribution of income and to investment in human resources through basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved , is fundamental to the eradication of poverty .  
Violations of human rights remain extremely serious , including , in particular , the practice of torture , summary and arbitrary executions , forced labour , including forced portering for the military , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detention , forced displacement , serious restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed , in particular , at ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
Those procedures have been established on the basis of the general and implicit powers of the Commission , in the light of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations governing the promotion of universal respect for and , observance of , human rights and freedoms and in the light of the obligations deriving from the pledge given by States Members to take joint and separate action in cooperation with the organs of the United Nations to implement those principles .  
The question arises , with growing urgency , as to whether any juridical legitimacy that could , arguably , have been derived from past acquiescence in the assumption of power by the Military Forces can any longer provide a defensible basis for the continued maintenance of a non-constitutional system based on the assumption of martial powers , having such an unfavourable impact on human rights in the context of generally accepted international norms and the obligations undertaken by Myanmar .  
In conclusion , on the basis of its experiences and achievements in promoting human rights , Tunisia has been able to incorporate establishment of the rule of law in a global approach , to initiate a process of economic , social and cultural development , and to promote human rights in all their dimensions , both at the structural level and at the level of day-to-day practice and procedures . 
Although both texts have been rendered obsolete - re-educational work camps and civic service camps having long since been closed down - they were expressly abrogated by Act No . 95-9 dated 23 January 1995 - evidence of the great importance the Tunisia of the new era attaches to international labour standards , and of its desire to achieve a high degree of harmonization of its legislation with the principles inspired by those standards , and in particular those relating to fundamental human rights . 
Ensure that pupils learn a foreign language to a sufficient level to enable them to have direct access to works of universal thought , technical works , scientific theories and human values , and train them to follow developments in these areas and to contribute to them in such a way as to enrich the national culture and its interaction with the universal human culture ;  
It explains why the Tunisia of the new era has opted for a national scientific development policy targeted on the needs of Tunisian society and guaranteeing increased protection of human rights conceived as an essential condition of economic , social and cultural progress .  
Since the freedom of creative activity is regarded as a fundamental condition for the development of human rights in science and technology , the national research system , inspired by the Declaration of 7 November 1987 , has endeavoured to encourage the exercise of this freedom by means of an array of legal , administrative , jurisdictional and trade-union measures .  
In addition to the Central Analysis and Testing Laboratory , the Government has established the National Institute for Research into Physical and Chemical Analysis , in order to equip the country with suitable means of providing accurate information about the composition of a substance and ensuring efficient and effective control of the content of products brought into use , thus preventing the circulation of products having invisible effects on human or animal health or harmful effects on the environment , and with a view to the issue of international certificates of conformity .  
In addition , Tunisia 's penal system is sufficiently well developed from the standpoint of criminal legislation and juridical institutions to ensure the punishment of any use of scientific progress for purposes prejudicial to human life or individual freedom or privacy .  
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
Cancelled : ( ii ) compendium on human settlement-related interventions in the control of vector-borne diseases in urban areas ; ( iv ) strategies for environmentally sound energy management in urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa ; and ( viii ) compendium of sustainable disposal techniques for septate and pit-latrine waste .  
It would be wholly unrealistic and even irresponsible to believe that , following the 1994 genocide which claimed the lives of between 500,000 and 1-million persons and involved substantial destruction of Rwanda 's infrastructure as well as ensuing instability and violence arising from continuing insurgency and counter-insurgency operations , anything less than sustained remedial efforts can bring about long-lasting improvement in the human rights situation .  
Effective monitoring of the human rights situation coupled with comprehensive advisory and promotional activities focused on the areas of greatest and most urgent concern are required .  
Among these indicators , the following should figure : substantial and regular respect for the right to life and physical integrity exercised by public agents of the Republic of Rwanda ; effective functioning of the judicial system at all levels ; conformity of arrest and detention practices with international human rights standards ; and humane conditions of detention throughout Rwanda .  
Following consideration as to what viable alternatives might be possible , the High Commissioner created a yearly human rights fund for field activities of $ 25-million to minimize the instability and uncertainty that has complicated current field operations , and to ensure that , when called for in future , a human rights field operation could be deployed urgently , without unnecessary delay arising from financial constraints .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated the continued validity of the fundamental right of all peoples to self-determination , the exercise of which , in the case of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation , is essential to ensure the eradication of all those situations and to guarantee universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
They expressed their concern over the deterioration of the food and agriculture situation in developing countries , reaffirmed the need to achieve food security and sustainable agricultural policies as fundamental objectives of development and asserted that the right to food was a fundamental human right , the respect and promotion of which constitute a moral imperative for the international community .  
They agreed that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should jointly sponsor draft resolutions to be presented by the Group of 77 at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly on the following agenda items : trade and development , cooperation for industrial development , environment and sustainable development , human settlements , population and development , external debt crisis and development , food and sustainable agricultural development , an Agenda for Development and renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership .  
Overcoming the many years of conflict in Angola would not only be a major blessing for a country which is friendly to us , for its people and for other States in the region of southern Africa , but would also be a substantial success for the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole , which have invested significant human , material and financial resources in support of the Angolan peace process .  
The chairpersons further recommend that consideration be given to more creative approaches whereby several of the various procedural amendments to the human rights treaties could be packaged together in a single , comprehensive document to be transmitted to the States parties to allow them the option of invoking their constitutional amendment procedures only once for all the amendments .  
The Sudanese Jurists Union stands by issues and problems concerning human rights all over the world ; ( ii ) the Sudanese Jurists Union defends the oppressed and the victims of unjust verdicts or actions ; ( iii ) the Sudanese Jurists Union desires the attainment of recognition and acknowledgement from the international organizations at large , and the United Nations in particular ; ( iv ) the Sudanese Jurists Union develops and advances the legal research and seminars regarding the above concerns . "  
To give free and unimpeded access to international human rights and humanitarian organizations and independent observers to all areas where enforced or involuntary disappearances or cases of slavery , slave trade and similar institutions and practices , especially the sale of and trafficking in children and women have been reported ;  
UNESCO 's efforts through programme implementation are centred on the training of human resources in fields of vital importance for their development , such as access to mother-tongue education , revitalization of components of their cultural heritage , development of traditional skills relating to the protection and use of natural resources , promotion of crafts and encouraging systematic mechanisms of dialogue with member States . UNESCO 's policy in the area of indigenous issues is a long-term task based on regular and progressive consultation with indigenous partners .  
It was said that the forum should have a broad mandate and that it should extend beyond a narrow human rights focus to include issues such as economic , social , cultural , political , civil , educational and developmental issues as well as play a role in the coordination of all relevant United Nations activities .  
In his message , the Secretary-General pointed out that the International Decade promotes concrete action in such vital areas as human rights , protection of the environment and access to health and education - areas in which indigenous people must be actively involved ; and also referred to the efforts the United Nations system can make to enhance international cooperation and understanding on issues of central concern to the world 's indigenous people .  
It is recommended that the programme of fellowships offered by the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and certain specialized agencies to train indigenous people wishing to gain experience relevant to indigenous issues should be expanded ; and also that community-based training and educational programmes on human rights and indigenous rights should be set up , and training and technical assistance courses in project design and management should be developed .  
Despite being forced to devote a large part of its human and material resources to defending its land and people against the expansionist policies of Israel , the Syrian Arab Republic had undertaken a comprehensive and successful social development programme .  The leadership provided by the President had ensured the political stability and democratic climate necessary for broad participation in youth-related activities .  
The Plan of Action has five objectives : the assessment of needs and formulation of strategies ; building and strengthening human rights education programmes at the international , regional , national and local levels ; developing and coordinating the development of human rights education materials ; strengthening the role of the mass media ; and promoting the global dissemination of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
The High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has continued actively to seek support and engaging in a dialogue within the framework of the Decade with several international non-governmental organizations , centres and associations that organize ( often through their networks of national chapters ) international programmes for human rights education addressed to specific targets or with a regional or thematic focus .  
For human rights education not to be theoretical , but to be relevant to people 's experience and , therefore , rooted in the historical , social , psychological , ethnic , gender , linguistic and other contexts of the learners ;  
It is suggested that the focal points ' tasks should be to identify national human rights education needs and to develop a national plan of action for human rights education containing specific objectives , strategies and programmes for the enhancement of human rights education at all levels , including pre-schools , primary and secondary schools , higher education , professional schools , training programmes for public officials and non-formal learning , including general public information .  
Finally , the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities for the promotion of human rights ; details about these activities at the national , regional and global level are outlined in the report of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights ( see E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 90 ) .  
The training packages will incorporate the methodological approach mentioned in paragraph 75 of the Plan of Action , and address the following professional groups : prison officers ; primary and secondary schoolteachers ; legal professionals ( judges and lawyers ) ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; media ; and human rights monitors .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
The Declaration on Partnership underscored that there was a need to provide well-targeted and affordable social safety nets by reducing unproductive spending , while ensuring adequate basic investment in infrastructure ; that the sustainability of economic growth depended on the development of human resources ; and that it was highly desirable to reform public pensions , employment insurance , social security and health systems in order to ensure their long-term viability .  
Since then , agreements have been concluded on human rights ; the resettlement of persons displaced by the armed conflict ; the establishment of the historical clarification commission ; the identity and rights of indigenous peoples ; social and economic aspects and the agrarian situation ; and now , the strengthening of civilian power and the role of the armed forces in a democratic society .  
Together with the agreements already signed , this Agreement seeks to create the conditions for genuine reconciliation among the people of Guatemala , based upon respect for human rights and the diversity of its peoples and on their shared determination to overcome the lack of social , economic and political opportunities , which undermines democratic coexistence and restricts the development of the nation ,  
All the Guatemala peace agreements posit that a firm and lasting peace must be based on respect for human rights and for the multi-ethnic , multicultural and multilingual character of the Guatemalan nation ; national economic development with social justice ; social participation ; the conciliation of interests ; and democratic institution-building .  
The doctrine shall encompass respect for the Guatemalan Constitution , human rights , the international instruments ratified by Guatemala in the military field , protection of national sovereignty and independence , the territorial integrity of Guatemala and the spirit of the agreements on a firm and lasting peace .  
The necessary amendments shall continue to be made to the corresponding regulations so that the military education system is consistent , in its philosophical framework , with respect for the Guatemalan Constitution and other laws , with a culture of peace and democratic coexistence , with the doctrine defined in this Agreement , and with national values , the integral development of the individual , knowledge of our national history , respect for human rights and the identity and rights of the indigenous peoples , and the primacy of the individual .  
The practice of voluntary military recruitment shall be continued , until the Government of Guatemala , on the basis of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights , adopts the necessary administrative decisions , and the Guatemalan Congress approves a civil service law , which shall include military service and community service ; this law shall entail fulfilment of a duty and a constitutional right , which is neither compulsory nor a violation of human rights , is universal and non-discriminatory , and would reduce the length of service and offer options to citizens .  
A Civilian Intelligence and Information Analysis Department to be established under the Ministry of the Interior shall be responsible for obtaining information to combat organized crime and ordinary crime , utilizing the means available and acting within the limits allowable under the legal system , and shall ensure full respect for human rights .  
The ideals that inspired the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are as relevant today as they were nearly half a century ago when the community of nations pledged to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Similarly , the High Commissioner has assertively sought to secure that economic , social and cultural rights , and particularly the right to development , acquire a higher profile within the framework of United Nations human rights efforts , in the spirit of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which proclaimed that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated . 
Through dialogue with Member States , through coordination with the United Nations agencies that support human rights efforts , through permanent contact with regional forums , academic institutions and the leadership of the main international financial institutions , the High Commissioner has sought to ensure that the issue of human rights become a constant in the thinking and actions of the political and economic forces that govern or influence events globally .  
It is perceived as encompassing the principle of universality in health care , so that all human beings may live with the knowledge that they can seek health care which is accessible , affordable , relevant , and of the requisite quality .  
The overall objective , strengthening civil society , is pursued on a country-by-country , regional , interregional and global basis , through the provision of assistance to national non-governmental organizations in the form of training courses on human rights , fellowships and support of appropriate projects developed by them .  
It offers constitutional and legislative assistance ; human rights support to parliaments ; human rights training for United Nations peacekeepers ; assistance in strengthening the administration of justice ( including human rights training for the legal profession , police and prison officials ) ; assistance for the establishment of independent , effective national human rights institutions ; assistance for the conduct of free and fair elections ; and support to non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
In a statement of 23 April 1996 on the situation of human rights in Colombia , the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to proceed , upon the initiative of the Government of Colombia and the identification of adequate sources of financing , to establish at the earliest possible date a permanent office in Colombia to assist the Colombian authorities in developing policies and programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights and to observe violations of human rights in the country , making analytical reports to the High Commissioner .  
The High Commissioner / Centre maintained a close working relation with the Conference secretariat by sharing its expertise and providing background materials as well as contributions in the area of human rights and on the specific issues of forced displacement , with a view to ensuring that commitments undertaken under international human rights and humanitarian law standards were accurately reflected in the final document of the Conference . 
The right to development is related to all human rights but can not be identified with the sum of the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights or be confused with development itself .  
States , as the principal actors in the realization of the right to development , should guarantee the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms , strengthen democracy and ensure an honest and transparent public administration and an efficient and impartial administration of justice .  
Other activities also continue to receive considerable attention , such as assistance on specific human rights issues , including the implementation of comprehensive national plans of action for the promotion and protection of human rights , popular participation in decision-making and implementation of projects relating to economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
It reaffirmed that democracy and transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society were indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development and that Governments in all countries should promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , bearing in mind the interdependent and mutually reinforcing relationship between democracy , development and respect for human rights , and should make public institutions more responsive to people 's needs .  
The " policies " and " practices " affecting human rights that came within the scope of investigation by the Special Committee referred , in the case of " policies " , to any course of action consciously adopted and pursued by the Government of Israel as part of its declared or undeclared intent ; while " practices " referred to those actions which , irrespective of whether or not they were in implementation of a policy , reflected a pattern of behaviour on the part of the Israeli authorities towards the civilian population in the occupied areas .  
Building increased public awareness of the social , economic and human costs of anti-personnel mines is essential to develop and sustain the necessary political will for a global anti-personnel mine ban .  
Concerning the use of national human resources , he said that the national staff of UNDP were among its most valuable resources ; in many of the field offices , the only international staff members were the resident representatives and their deputies , while all the others were nationals , who were generally experienced in the work of UNDP programmes and projects , familiar with the culture and language , and frequently had worked for the Government , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the mass media . 
Such practices are also liable to generate a worrying state of affairs , not only for Iraq , but also for Turkey and the region as a whole , which is primarily afflicted by the irregular situation created by the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq , not to mention the human injury to which Iraqi citizens are exposed as a result of the illegitimate activities of the Turkish armed forces and their military operations inside the territory of the Republic of Iraq . 
The Secretary-General believed that priority should be given to such areas as the maintenance of international peace and security ; the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing world ; the promotion of development in Africa ; the protection of human rights ; more effective responses to humanitarian emergencies ; and the promotion of justice and international law .  
The Serbian authorities are continuing their campaign of State terror through , to mention only a few forms , killing and torturing of Albanians , raids of homes throughout Kosova , illegal arrests and systematic persecution and maltreatment of political and human rights activists , imprisonment of people because of their political convictions , systematic and continued campaigns to destroy the Albanian cultural heritage , including by halting education in Albanian and crushing the efforts of the Albanians to preserve their identity in Kosova .  
The programme is thus composed of the three following major activities : promotion and implementation of the principles of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , and rights contained in other relevant international instruments ; cooperation and coordination with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , including with the international human rights community , and the programme of technical assistance and advisory services ; and , dialogue with Governments and all other parties concerned with minority issues .  
With reference to a participatory approach to sustainable human settlements through the development and support of strategies and mechanisms that encouraged open and inclusive dialogue among all interested parties , it was stressed that special attention needed to be paid to minorities .  
In a number of cases , Special Rapporteurs , appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries , and on thematic issues , have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
The present report is a joint interim report submitted to the General Assembly by Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and Mr . Param Cumaraswamy , Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the independence of judges and lawyers , pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1996 / 79 of 23 April 1996 , entitled " Situation of human rights in Nigeria " .  2 .  The report is divided into five chapters .  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Recognize that increased use of solar energy can reduce environmental degradation caused by adverse human activities , such as industrial pollution and deforestation , and that it is the responsibility of Governments and all sectors of civil society to work together to find lasting solutions to problems threatening the sustainable development of humanity ;  
In addition to the constitutional protection of individual and social rights and freedoms , Greece has signed and sanctioned virtually all international conventions on human rights and on the elimination of racial discrimination , in particular :  
Since many questions and misunderstandings surround the definitions and content of the terminologies of sects , new religious movements and even formal religion and since in international practice confusion reigns and States may have diametrically opposed attitudes to the same group , raising it to formal religious status or pejoratively classifying it as a sect , the Special Rapporteur feels that an international high-level governmental conference should be held to study and decide upon a common approach to sects and religions that respects human rights . 
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
As a regional political organization of which Tajikistan is a member and which had established a rapport with the Government before becoming involved with humanitarian work , OSCE is in a position not only to monitor human rights but to support the development of the entire democratic process , combining an active field presence with political influence .  
In resolution 1996 / 54 , the Commission , inter alia , commended the continued operation in Cambodia of the office of the Centre for Human Rights ; welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the role of the Centre ; recognized the seriousness with which the Government of Cambodia has approached the preparation of its initial reports to the relevant treaty bodies , and encouraged the Government to continue its efforts to meet its reporting obligations under international human rights instruments , drawing on the assistance of the office in Cambodia of the Centre for Human Rights ;  
The High Commissioner stressed the importance of human rights education in the school system , welcomed the impressive amount of human rights education , both formal and informal , ongoing in Cambodia , and informed the workshop participants of United Nations efforts to promote human rights education worldwide through the mechanism of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education . 
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
The objectives of the Independent Bureau have remained the same as those pursued by the Independent Commission , i.e . , to study specific humanitarian issues that have been inadequately dealt with to date or that call for solutions in line with new realities ; to identify opportunities for more effective action by the international community and to make practical , action-oriented proposals to that end ; to enhance public awareness of the conditions that create and perpetuate human suffering ; and to strengthen efforts at governmental and non-governmental level to bring about appropriate changes and adjustments . 
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
Distinct from the framework of fundamental human rights and freedoms , such an approach would concentrate on practical humanitarian problems whose continuing growth needs to be vigorously discouraged through solidarity with the victims as much as the human suffering they entail needs to be alleviated .  
In accordance with the recommendations of the General Assembly in paragraph 6 of its resolution 49 / 194 and of the Commission on Human Rights in paragraph 6 of its resolution 1995 / 54 , the High Commissioner , by a letter of 28 August 1995 addressed to all relevant United Nations agencies and financial institutions , has sought to explore possibilities for obtaining from such institutions , acting within their mandates , technical and financial assistance for supporting the Organization 's efforts to promote human rights and the rule of law .  
The rule of law is understood as a human right in itself but also as essential means for the protection of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
Key components of administrative modernization and local government reform programmes are : the reorganization of civil service personnel administration and the delegation of authority for human resources management to the provincial governments ; the revision of civil service pay , career and incentive structures to enable the Government to recruit and retain qualified staff ; the design and implementation of an integrated public administration training system ;  
However , in spite of donor support and encouragement , progress has been slow in most of these areas for two main reasons : lack of human and financial capacity to manage such complex reforms ; and political sensitivity , which call for broad consultations and negotiations involving Parliament and civil society , thereby further contributing to the complexity of the reform process .  
Major initiatives in the economic management , public sector reform and decentralization area included the assistance to the completion of a comprehensive national Economic Management Capacity-Building Programme ( EMP ) , adopted by the Government in mid-1995 , one component of which is targeted at aid policy and coordination ; the associated Programme Support Document ( PSD ) , which also contemplates the formulation of a sustainable human development ( SHD ) strategy ( with UNICEF ) ; and the continued support to reconstruction and development planning at the provincial and district levels .  
Expressing its solidarity with the people and countries that suffer as a result of natural disasters and expressing also the deepest sympathy to all victims of the natural disasters that have struck in various parts of the globe , Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;  
The specialized agencies also played an active role in the countries in transition : by supporting national efforts to improve management systems in public organizations ; by giving advice on the legislative and regulatory framework necessary for establishing a market economy ; by encouraging decentralization through support to local communities ; by consolidating the democratization process ; by supporting human resource programmes , social programmes and the creation of small and medium-size businesses ; by fostering integration between neighbouring countries , and by generating capital flows .  
The report further noted that Africa 's future economic performance might be impeded by long-term structural constraints to development , such as high external indebtedness , unequal distribution of and access to resources , poorly developed institutions and low levels of human resource development .  
At the regional level , the Economic Commission for Africa played a leading role in assisting Member States in their implementation of the Platform , focusing human and financial resources on enhancing women 's political leadership role and economic empowerment and promoting their legal and human rights .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
At the same time , recent scientific findings , as contained in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , confirmed that the global climate was undergoing changes as a result of human activities and that it was increasingly urgent to take consistent precautionary action .  
Professor Bert Bolin , Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , referring to the paragraph in the Summary for Policy Makers in the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC in which it was stated that " the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate " , said that the paragraph in question had been agreed upon after an extensive discussion and very careful consideration by governments , in view of the importance of the key finding for policy makers . 
He confirms that Azerbaijani prisoners of war were tortured and humiliated , forced to eat dirt , brutally beaten , had open wounds poked with lighted cigarettes and were deprived of their human dignity .  
The Conference expressed concern at the escalation of armed hostilities in Afghanistan , which had resulted in immense human losses and irreparable damage to the country in the economic , social and cultural spheres , and endangered regional peace , stability and security .  
It was not easy to conclude from the report of the Secretary-General on human resources management ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 1 ) whether the Office of Human Resources Management ( OHRM ) had developed the specific guidelines required to translate the universal rules established by the General Assembly for use by programme managers and whether any monitoring mechanism had been put in place to ensure proper implementation at the departmental level of the relevant General Assembly decisions and resolutions .  
At its forty-ninth session , the General Assembly decided to appropriate , on an exceptional basis , $ 4,473,000 under section 21 on the understanding that the posts requested by the Secretary-General for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , the Centre for Human Rights and the human rights presence in Cambodia had been approved on a temporary basis and that all posts would be subject to a detailed review by the Advisory Committee and the Assembly at the earliest opportunity at the resumed forty-ninth session .  
It fully supported the work of the United Nations in the promotion and protection of human rights and commended the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , whose work had enhanced the capacity of the United Nations to face the major challenges in that field , particularly in the wake of the World Conference on Human Rights which had declared human rights to be universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
His delegation believed that disarmament should be treated as a separate and distinct programme ; that decolonization continued to be an issue of vital importance for the United Nations ; and that all aspects of human rights should be addressed in a balanced manner . 
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term " discrimination against women " shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .  
It is also important to set the ways and means to achieve this by utilizing not only official development assistance but also private investment , trade , social infrastructure building , human capacity development , and all other elements which are essential to achieving those targets , as well as by devising an ideal policy mix to suit the concrete socio-economic conditions of the countries involved .  
Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations .

In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .  
" Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall respect fully the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States , their constitutions and the fundamental principles of their legal systems , as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms . "  [ 1 ] / E / 1996 / 99 .  
This biased attitude of the republic of Croatia is evident also in the report of Ms . Elizabeth Rehn of 14 March 1996 , which contains ( on pp . 62-86 ) numerous examples of human rights violations , killings , and mistreatment of the civilian population , destruction of private property , prevention of the return of refugees and so on effected by wilful extremists whose behaviour escapes control .  
Being aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
One of the issues raised was the use of modern means of communication like the Internet to spread racist propaganda , and national and international steps had been proposed to deal with that problem , such as the holding of a seminar sponsored by the Office of the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , bringing together various United Nations bodies and the Internet service providers to discuss the use of the Internet in ways consistent with human rights .  
The hiring of mercenaries to guarantee internal security and public order in African States could be regarded as a threat to the inalienable sovereign responsibility of States for their own internal order and security and to their responsibility to prevent the repression of their citizens or the violation of their human rights ; and the international community should examine the extent to which it considered the recruitment of mercenaries to be legal .  
The right of option must be exercised within a reasonable period from the date of succession and must have no adverse consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their residence in the successor State or their movable or immovable property in that State - a new rule which derived from the progressive development of law and accorded with international human rights standards .  
At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that the concept of development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional undertaking with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition .  
Technical support and cooperation are provided in order to yield concrete results , with special attention being devoted to human resource development and institution-building designed to contribute better to the efforts of recipient countries to create an overall enabling environment at a policy and institutional level .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas ;  
In that part of the former Yugoslavia , the ethnic Albanians , who constituted the overwhelming majority continued to be subjected to Serbian police and military repression and to large-scale violations of their human rights despite repeated condemnations of that situation in the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
While for most developing countries this appears to call for increasing and qualitatively upgrading their infrastructural and human resource base , for economies in transition it would seem largely to involve new ways of using existing R &amp; amp ; D and technological potential - created for a different economic system - in a way that is more appropriate to market economies and their changing societies .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
Faced with the related phenomena of a large informal sector and a missing middle in their enterprise structure , LDCs need to take specific measures , in the context of their enterprise development strategies , targeted at helping their micro and small enterprises to grow and drawing them into the formal sector , through the development of an infrastructural and human resource base , the strengthening of their technological capabilities , and the provision of finance , training and other business support services .  
With regard to the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of peoples to self-determination , the report of the Special Rapporteur gave ample proof of the growing involvement of mercenaries in armed conflict , especially internal armed conflict , and raised important questions on the gaps in national and international legislation relating to such activities , and as to whether the existence of companies selling security services to countries in exchange for concessions should be tolerated .  
Her country had endeavoured to solve the social and economic problems of Crimea , adopting measures which could not be considered discriminatory , since they were compatible with international law and with internationally recognized principles of human rights .  
As part of the measures agreed upon between States and the international organizations , Algeria fully supported proposals for the convening of an international conference on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; the creation of a mechanism to monitor the media as purveyors of hatred , racism and xenophobia ; making the administrative regulations for the granting of visas more flexible ; promoting exchanges between individuals and cross-cultural communication ; and the teaching of human rights at all levels of education .  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
The proclamation of the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People reflected the commitment of the international community to promoting and protecting the human rights of indigenous people , especially their economic , social and cultural well-being .  
The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .  
He hoped that the Decade 's programme of activities would be implemented fully and that problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights , the environment , development , education and health would be solved effectively through efforts at the national level and greater international cooperation .  
All norms and principles of human rights enshrined in regional and international human rights instruments and covenants shall be an integral part of the constitution of the Sudan and any law , decree , executive order or policy measure contrary thereto shall be considered null and void and unconstitutional ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
His delegation had repeatedly expressed the view that the legal regime governing reservations should be kept uniform and agreed that there should be no special regime for normative and , in particular , human rights treaties .  
of those Conventions had deviated from customary international law on certain matters , France nevertheless considered that the rules concerning reservations contained in the 1969 Vienna Convention functioned fairly well and that the system established in 1969 must not be abandoned in favour of positions adopted by some international human rights bodies concerning the allegedly special case of human rights treaties . 
With respect to working methods , his delegation supported the Special Rapporteur 's recommendation that the Commission should adopt a flexible approach involving both codification of international law ( inasmuch as fundamental human rights were involved ) and its progressive development ( as far as matters of succession of States were concerned ) .  
It acts with its partners in the international community to assist in meeting the operational challenges of migration ; to advance understanding of migration issues ; to encourage social and economic development through migration ; and to work towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
By investing in both capital and human resources , attaching special importance to raising the quality of basic and specialized education , the development of work skills , professional training and improvement of qualifications ;  
Although significant progress had been made in the field of human rights , particularly in the eradication of apartheid and the adoption of conventions protecting the human rights of women and children , the enjoyment of political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights was far from being universal , and it was regrettable that the end of the cold war had not brought about an improvement in the situation .  
In discharging its human rights obligations and in its approach to human rights in general , Egypt adhered to a number of principles : the politicization of human rights and their use as an instrument to achieve political objectives must be avoided ; double standards must not be applied to human rights situations ; full account must be taken of cultural differences in the context of human rights issues ; and human rights , including social , economic and political rights and the right to development , were indivisible .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect fundamental human rights in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
The Covenant , which was considered by many to be the single most important human rights instrument , codified the essential freedoms which people must enjoy in an effective democratic society , such as the right to vote and to participate in government , to freedom of peaceful assembly , to equal protection of the law , the right to liberty and security and to freedom of opinion and expression .  
The United States had also ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ; the latter should be a very valuable tool as the international community responded to humanitarian and human rights crises born of racial and ethnic animosities .  
While the international community was giving considerable attention to the promotion and protection of human rights , and while the international and regional human rights mechanisms had therefore gained in effectiveness , it nevertheless had to be recognized that much more needed to be done to check the wave of reported and noted violations , especially in view of the geopolitical instability , regional and ethnic conflicts and recent social turmoil .  
It was essential to monitor the efficacy of the international human rights norms that were the basis of the work of the treaty bodies and the efficacy of the special procedures and thematic machinery which played an irreplaceable role in the effective promotion and protection of human rights .  
His Government was deeply concerned at the lack of progress towards democratization and the continuing violation of human rights in Myanmar , particularly the continuing detention of political prisoners under very harsh conditions , the use of forced labour , the forced displacement of ethnic communities and the ongoing harassment of those engaged in legitimate political activity .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Aside from the heavy tribute paid daily in numerous human lives in particular by the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons the refugees who are returning from Zaire by the thousands , fleeing the cataclysm abroad , are faced with tragic conditions in their own country , Burundi , and are being throttled by an embargo which is arbitrary in every way .  
These are the cause of confrontations and armed conflicts that unfortunately create an exodus of thousands of human beings who take to the roads : men , women , children and old people are left abandoned , adrift in despair wandering waves of humanity searching for safe or supposedly safe places , forced to survive crushed together , sometimes like cattle , in camps where the conditions were just described by our colleague from Zaire as subhuman .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
In view of the unacceptable nature of such human rights violations , the General Assembly must express its deep concern over the recalcitrant attitude of the Nigerian Government to world opinion and adopt measures that were commensurate with the magnitude of human rights violations that had been and continued to be committed by the Government of Nigeria .  
Efforts should continue for the establishment of an international criminal court to combat the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of the most serious crimes against humanity , the worst war criminals and the worst violators of human rights , who went unpunished as a result of defunct or seriously flawed judicial systems and pro domo amnesty laws .  
Attempts to separate international and regional systems for protecting human rights were artificial ; both systems should be complementary and mutually supportive .  
BOHAYEVSKY ( Ukraine ) said that the international protection and promotion of human rights could be effective only if it was based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
Adopting a presumptuous , arrogant and biased approach to the question of human rights , pursuing double standards or politicizing the issue in a deliberate attempt to provoke political confrontation would harm the promotion and protection of those rights .  
His Government reiterated its commitment to work with the United Nations in matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security in the hope that some day all the Organization 's human and financial resources could be devoted to encouraging social development and improving the living conditions of people everywhere .  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Regrettably , the world continued to be confronted by civil strife , ethnic cleansing , lawlessness and extreme poverty , all of which posed a considerable challenge to the full enjoyment of human rights .  
Concrete measures which had been identified included improved police training methods , a protection programme for witnesses of human rights violations , assistance to victims of violent crimes , transfer to civilian courts of competence to try military police crimes , and federal investigation of human rights violations .  
" Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity , and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights . "  
REZVANI ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) said that regional institutions and instruments played a key role in the promotion and protection of human rights , and were capable of reflecting regional political , social , cultural and economic factors .  
The civilian component of the mission , acting under the broadened political mandate thus granted to my Special Representative , has assisted in bringing together various segments of the population in an effort to promote mutual understanding between communities , monitor human rights and ease political and inter-ethnic tensions within the country .  
" Being aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
As respect for fundamental rights and freedoms was an essential precondition for peace and security in the world , and for the prevention of international disputes and conflicts , Governments must , in order to strengthen international human rights monitoring machinery , report in a timely fashion on the manner in which they fulfilled their treaty obligations and must be required to cooperate with the United Nations special rapporteurs , working groups and experts .  
He commended the Commissioner 's efforts to restructure the Centre for Human Rights and emphasized the need for extensive consideration of that question by Member States and guidance by the General Assembly before action was taken .  The right to development was a fundamental human right and must be fully respected and implemented on a firm financial basis .  
The use of alleged human rights violations as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of States must cease , and progress in the human rights field must be accompanied by tangible advances in economic and social development .  
It was paradoxical that those States which were the most vocal critics of the developing countries ' record on human rights were silent upon the subject of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Nevertheless , the period of time covered in his report ( A / 51 / 457 ) was very long and many of the matters referred to had already been resolved , as reflected in reports of the Secretary-General on the situation in Central America and on the progress made in the political , economic and social fields , particularly by the efforts to improve the judicial system , public security mechanisms and human rights institutions .  
The representative of Norway , a country with which Burundi had excellent cooperative relations , had , at a previous meeting , said that the coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at that had taken place in Burundi in 1995 had not improved the security or human rights situation but , on the contrary , had exacerbated the suffering of the people .  
Please describe specific measures taken to guarantee the child 's right to life and to create an environment conducive to ensuring to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child , including physical , mental , spiritual , moral , psychological and social development , in a manner compatible with human dignity , and to prepare the child for an individual life in a free society .  
The purpose of the United Nations internship programme is to promote among the participants ( usually students enrolled in a graduate school ) a better understanding of major problems confronting the United Nations ; the programme also provides departments , at Headquarters and elsewhere , with the assistance of outstanding young students specializing in a relevant field , such as economics , social affairs , international law , international relations , human rights , political science , or public administration .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of guarantees of due process of law , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ;  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
The right to development was thus essential to the peoples of developing countries , who needed higher incomes , improved social , health and education services and a chance to escape from extreme poverty and enjoy better living conditions if they were to be able to make a constructive contribution to the development of democratic systems that would guarantee full respect for their human rights .  
It was also essential to ascertain the truth about the thousands of missing persons ; to assist the victims of genocide , rape and abuse ; and to bring to justice all instigators and perpetrators of crimes against humanity and grave violations of international humanitarian law .  NULLIn view of the crucial need for human rights education , a special publication had been produced containing the texts of all the international human rights instruments stipulated in the Dayton Peace Agreement .  
" Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations . "  
Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations . 
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
The experience of his country and others which had introduced basic economic reforms in tandem with systemic reforms confirmed that the successful pursuit of sustainable growth required that individuals be given the opportunity to be the active agents of change , that they must enjoy basic human rights and freedoms and that entrepreneurship should be encouraged .  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations as set forth in the Charter is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons ; enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expression , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
Welcomes the statement by the Government of the Sudan , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , [ 10 ] in which it pledged its logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery , and , accordingly , calls upon the Government to grant international human rights and humanitarian organizations and independent observers free and unimpeded access to all areas where these violations have been reported ;  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
Urges all States to refrain from adopting or implementing any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those of a coercive nature with all their negative extraterritorial effects , which create obstacles to trade relations among States , thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [ 6 ] and other international human rights instruments , in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development ;  
Rejects coercive extraterritorial measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women and the elderly ;  
Noting that , at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in the relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals in their communities , as well as reports of States Parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
At the World Food Summit recently held in Rome , which it would have been more appropriate to call the " World Hunger Summit " , the rich countries had harped shamelessly on human rights , while destroying food surpluses in order to keep prices high , despite the fact that satisfying one 's hunger was a fundamental human right and that the starvation of millions was the most flagrant , massive and systematic violation of the right to life .  
Respect for fundamental human rights was deeply embedded in what was called the " Pacific way " , a sort of unspoken mutual understanding that meant that respect for the basic rights of all came naturally to the peoples of the Pacific islands and that it was natural for them to seek out dialogue , in other words , to practice democracy , a fact of which they were quite proud .  
He wondered why the United States Government used double standards , accusing some countries of human rights violations , while turning a blind eye to those committed by some of its allies and ignoring the thousands of political detainees and shielding the killing of unarmed women and children and the occupation of foreign territory as it made use of its veto .  
It was regrettable that , instead of striving to halt the widespread gross violations of human rights in their own societies and rectifying their racist and discriminatory attitudes towards nationals of other countries residing in their territories , certain States arrogated to themselves the role of universal guardians and preachers of human rights , levelling unsubstantiated accusations against other countries on a purely selective basis .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
the experience gathered by the Division through its long _ standing technical assistance programmes ( such as ACIS , ASYCUDA , Trade Facilitation , Trade Points , as well as its direct and broad range experience in training human resources in island and land-locked countries for example ) has constantly underlined that , whatever the quality of technologies , the human factor is the essential ingredient for success .  
Besides the concluding observations , the main body of the present report is divided into six sections , on public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative questions .  
The transfer of the productive and social infrastructure of rural human settlements , as well as their housing , to their current occupants remains a complicated undertaking that requires continued efforts from all involved parties , including the affected communities . 
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Convinced that education and public information activities in the field of human rights were prerequisites for the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the three main sponsors , Australia , Costa Rica and Namibia , had decided to draft a single text combining two previous General Assembly resolutions on that issue . 
To give attention to the rights and needs of adolescent girls , which call for special actions for their protection from sexual exploitation and abuse , harmful cultural practices , teenage pregnancy and vulnerability to sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , and for the development of life skills and self-esteem , reaffirming that the advancement and empowerment of women throughout the life cycle must begin with the girl child at all ages ;  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
" Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of internationally recognized safeguards , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice and the absence of due process of law , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ; 
Moreover , it wished to point out that the fifth preambular paragraph seriously misquoted the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights ; that , contrary to the statement in operative paragraph 3 , nothing in the international human rights instruments precluded the adoption of sanctions under domestic law ; that paragraph 4 wrongly implied that the right to self-determination included a right to trade and economic relations ; and that paragraph 5 incorrectly involved the Commission on Human Rights in issues of trade and economics .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
" Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights " ;  
" Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect fundamental human rights in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 38 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Recommends that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty and to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty and the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
In an earlier report , JIU had expressed the view that it would be premature and even counterproductive to delegate essential functions before human resources management policies were formulated , all personnel procedures were reviewed and improved , proper demarcation of responsibilities in human resources management was established between OHRM and other offices and departments , and appropriate mechanisms for reporting and accountability were put in place .  
Those measures included the introduction of a human resources management planning function which would enable the Secretariat to project staff needs and design training to meet those needs ; the introduction of performance management through the Performance Appraisal System ; the introduction of people management training designed to enable managers and supervisors to have a better understanding of and to take responsibility for the staff entrusted to them ; and the initial development of a management assignment programme for P-2 and P-3 staff recruited through the national competitive examination process .  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
The enormous human and social strains of globalization could be minimized by stimulating sustained economic growth , particularly in the major industrialized countries .  
In his view , the role of Governments was to create a stable macroeconomic and political environment , to put in place a competent and effective administration , and to create a juridical framework that favoured private investment and guaranteed the maximum development of human resources .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .  
As I pointed out in my previous report , it is in these areas that MICIVIH has placed emphasis since its redeployment in October 1994 and it is in these areas that the Mission , because of its extensive field experience and accumulated expertise , would be able to make a significant contribution to the consolidation of key structures charged with protection of human rights and to the deepening of the democratic process . 
At its 3rd plenary meeting , on 20 September 1996 , the General Assembly , on the recommendation of the General Committee , decided to include in the agenda of its fifty-first session the item entitled " Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " and to allocate it to the Third Committee . 
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
" Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
" Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in the relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals in their communities , as well as reports of States Parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
" Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
" Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , " Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but that face economic hardship ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Noting that , at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
At its fifty-first session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1995 / 82 of 8 March 1995 , aware of the rapid development of the life sciences and the dangers that certain practices may pose to the integrity and dignity of the individual and seeking to ensure that scientific progress benefits individuals and develops in a manner respectful of fundamental human rights , invited Governments , the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system ,  
The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences ( CIOMS ) stated that bioethics in the health sector should be guided by generally accepted principles , in particular by the principle that an adequate level of health care should be recognized as a universal and fundamental human right .  
According to the Standard Professional Code for German Physicians , which underlies all individual professional codes in this respect , all physicians , prior to conducting any clinical trial on a human person or epidemiological research using personal data , must seek the advice of a medical ethics commission on the medical and legal issues involved .  
Although the sciences of biology and law seem far apart and unrelated , being regarded as two distinct cultures , in actual fact the concerns of law are closely interlinked with those of biology , particularly after the tremendous achievements made by biological science in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes and the positive or negative improvement of offspring .  
To this end , every State must take the requisite legislative measures to ensure that the law intervenes by placing restrictions and controls on the biological sciences so that these restrictions and controls can help to curb scientific progress that has an adverse effect on human values and creates legal and ethical problems .  
Among other things , the committee is endeavouring to lay down the main principles for reconciling technological progress in these fields with ethical and legal standards , human values , human rights and social , economic and cultural realities .  
UNMIBH was established pursuant to annex 11 of the Peace Agreement to assist the parties in their obligations of providing a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions , by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of guarantees of due process of law , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ;  
" Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of internationally recognized safeguards , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice and the absence of due process of law , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Welcomes the statement by the Government of the Sudan , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , [ 68 ] in which it pledged its logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery , and , accordingly , calls upon the Government to grant international human rights and humanitarian organizations and independent observers free and unimpeded access to all areas where these violations have been reported ;  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply deplore the loss of so many human lives , the material damage and the indescribable suffering caused by armed conflicts in the subregion , which are generating millions of refugees and displaced persons , and express our deep gratitude to the countries and peoples of the subregion for their generous and fraternal hospitality and welcome . 
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
" Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas ;  
Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 of 25 July 1996 ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Recommends that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty and to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty and the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Significant human and financial resources are being devoted by the international community to assistance in mine clearance , which is , by its nature , a long-term task ; to efficient and effective demining programmes where the primary emphasis is on the development of national mine-clearance capacities by afflicted countries ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of victims of landmines .  
Such prohibitions , whether they involved the principle of non-use of force ( subpara . ( a ) ) , avoiding extreme political or economic coercion ( subpara . ( b ) ) , respect for the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents , premises , archives and documents ( subpara . ( c ) ) or the requirement not to derogate from basic human rights , had been generally well accepted .  
The Committee 's evaluation should be seen as decisive for the image of the State in question and should supersede national self-judgement where racial and ethnic issues were concerned , since racism and ethnic conflicts constituted an essential component of the overall human rights equation .  
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .

Europe possesses what is essential for achieving this - a space with a single world-view extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok , where the bipolar world no longer exists and a common value system based on the philosophy of democratic liberalism and respect for human rights is being established . 
The World Conference on Human Rights ( Vienna , June 1993 ) in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action stated that human rights education , training and public information were essential for the promotion and achievement of stable and harmonious relations among communities and for fostering mutual understanding , tolerance and peace .  
In the same resolution the General Assembly invited the specialized agencies and United Nations programmes to contribute , within their respective spheres of competence , to the implementation of the Plan of Action ; called upon a wide range of non-governmental organizations and others to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights ; and requested the existing human rights monitoring bodies to place emphasis on the implementation by Member States of their international obligation to promote human rights education .  
The General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights both called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the Centre for Human Rights in carrying out the activities of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education .  
The United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education shall be guided by the definition and normative basis set out in part I of the present Plan of Action and shall further be directed to creating the broadest possible awareness and understanding of all of the norms , concepts and values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and in other relevant international human rights instruments .  
A comprehensive approach to education for human rights , including civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and recognizing the indivisibility and interdependence of all rights , as defined by the United Nations , shall be adopted for all activities under the Decade .  
In order to enhance their effectiveness , human rights education efforts for the Decade shall be shaped in such a way as to be relevant to the daily lives of learners , and shall seek to engage learners in a dialogue about the ways and means of transforming human rights from the expression of abstract norms to the reality of their social , economic , cultural and political conditions .  
In recognition of the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy , development and human rights , human rights education under the Decade shall seek to further effective democratic participation in the political , economic , social and cultural spheres , and shall be utilized as a means of promoting economic and social progress and people-centred sustainable development .  
Governments should play an active role in the implementation of the programme of the Decade through the development of national plans of action for human rights education , the introduction or strengthening of national human rights curricula in their formal educational systems , the conducting of national information campaigns on human rights and the opening of public access to human rights resource , information and training centres , as well as through enhanced donor support for relevant voluntary funds and international and national human rights education programmes .  
Schools , universities , professional and vocational training programmes and institutions should be encouraged and assisted in developing human rights curricula and corresponding teaching and resource materials , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes , for incorporation into formal education at the early childhood , primary , secondary , post-secondary and adult education levels .  
Appropriate institutions of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , workers ' and employers ' organizations , labour unions , the mass media , religious organizations , community organizations , the family , independent information , resource and training centres and others , for the purpose of incorporating human rights education into non-formal programmes , should be encouraged and assisted in developing and delivering such non-formal programmes , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes .  
Each national focal point should be charged with identifying national human rights education needs , developing a national plan of action , raising funds , coordinating with regional and international bodies involved in implementing the objectives of the Decade and reporting to the High Commissioner for Human Rights on needs , proposals and progress made towards the realization of the goals of the Decade ;  
The survey and evaluation and the resulting preliminary report shall seek to identify with particularity , at the international , regional and national levels , inter alia , the number and types of human rights educational materials available , existing human rights educational institutes , centres and permanent focal points , national percentages of teachers trained in human rights education , the percentage of schools having adopted human rights curricula at the primary , secondary and post-secondary levels , and number and types of human rights education components in professional training and non-formal education programmes .  
National focal points will be encouraged , in the interest of building local and community-based capacities for human rights education , to include all local and community-based organizations in the national roster described in component four above , and to direct their efforts and resources , including support received from international sources , to enabling such local and community-based organizations to deliver effective human rights education to their constituencies .  
With the support of national focal points and national resource and training centres , local and community-based organizations should be prepared to deliver popular human rights education , through vocational and adult education , literacy training , local non-governmental organizations , family outreach and religious education .  
Under the coordination of the High Commissioner and the respective national focal points for human rights education , and according to the plan developed following the survey , Governments and national non-governmental organizations , universities and institutes , will be called upon to carry out translation , publication and distribution of appropriate versions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , with technical and financial assistance from international organizations and programmes , where necessary .  
The national , regional and international structures and networks established under the Decade should continue to serve as permanent focal and contact points for international cooperation in the field of human rights education , and the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , in cooperation with UNESCO , should maintain , and make available upon request , a current roster of such organizations and focal points .  
Our common goal is to ensure that , while keeping and promoting this positive trend , we are vigilant and active in order to contribute together to the maintenance of peace , the establishment and consolidation of democratic societies based on the rule of law and respect for human and minority rights , social development and the promotion of international cooperation .  
The developments which took place prior to the Dayton Peace Agreement proved once again that a lack of firm and prompt international response to aggression leads to further aggravation of crises , causes untold human suffering and makes it all the more difficult to find solutions .  
It is appropriate , therefore , that at this meeting of the Council the international community is renewing its support for further efforts to bring about continued progress towards lasting peace , economic reconstruction , the strengthening of national institutions , the promotion of human rights and justice and , more importantly , respect for the independence , sovereignty , legal continuity and territorial integrity of a unified Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders .

The understanding of the relationship between the environment and sustainable development , coupled with the call by the Rio Conference for an authentic , durable and widespread change of habits and attitudes , especially in industrialized countries , would create a pattern for development that was not only environmentally and socially sustainable , but also equitably distributed with the human person as its central focus .

Requests the Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the common system , including , inter alia , consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session . 
Also emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
To that end , the court should be based on optional jurisdiction , its jurisdiction should cover only the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole , it should ensure respect for and primacy of national criminal justice systems , it should be an independent international juridical institution , and accused persons should be accorded all relevant individual human rights and commonly recognized procedural guarantees .  
It had been agreed , in the preliminary exchanges of views , that the Working Group 's visit could with advantage be preceded by a preparatory visit so that , firstly , the Group could more easily take cognizance of certain constraints , political or technical ( for example the problem of distances ) , facing such a visit and to have a better understanding of Chinese law , in particular with regard to the difficulties entailed in bringing it into conformity with the international instruments on human rights .  
" Decides that the priorities for the biennium 1998-1999 are the following : maintenance of international peace and security ; promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and recent United Nations conferences ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts ; promotion of justice and international law ; disarmament ; drug control , crime prevention , as well as combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations ; "  
In its resolution 1996 / 27 of 29 August 1996 , the Sub-Commission requested the Secretary-General , in accordance with Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 290 , to convene an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions and its relationship to internationally recognized human rights , with a view to developing a set of comprehensive human rights guidelines on forced evictions , and to submit the report on the seminar , together with the guidelines , to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
While differences in the economic , social , cultural and historical circumstances of the world 's societies mean that differences will continue between democracy as viewed by one society and democracy as viewed by another , democracy is increasingly being recognized as a response to a wide range of human concerns and as essential to the protection of human rights .  
The material means of progress can be acquired , but human resources - skilled , spirited and inventive workers - are indispensable , as is the enrichment found through mutual dialogue and the free interchange of ideas .  
Within the original framework of the Charter , democracy was understood as essential to efforts to prevent future aggression , and to support the sovereign State as the basic guarantor of human rights , the basic mechanism for solving national problems and the basic element of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
NULLNonetheless , during that time the United Nations was active in keeping international organization alive , in promoting and facilitating decolonization , in easing the transition of newly independent peoples into the international State system , in promoting economic and social development , in building human rights machinery and in defending international law . 
8 December 1988 , reaffirming that the will of the people , expressed in periodic and genuine elections , shall be the basis of authority of government , the General Assembly stressed that , " as a matter of practical experience , the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country is a crucial factor in the effective enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights and fundamental freedoms , embracing political , economic , social , and cultural rights " . 
The global mandate of the United Nations spans economic , social , security , political , humanitarian and human rights issues , which is why the United Nations is active across virtually the full range of issues relevant to democratization and can help integrate these issues into a wider effort linking peacekeeping , refugee assistance , relief efforts , reconstruction and development .  
With the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , held at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 , the United Nations began a series of international conferences that have brought together not only all States , but also relevant non-governmental organizations and other representatives of civil society to focus on interlocking economic and social issues by considering their impact on the human person and human communities .  
The logic of the Charter is today made manifest as United Nations support for democratization helps to prevent aggression and to foster the construction and maintenance of viable and independent States as the basic guarantors of human rights , the basic mechanisms for solving national problems and the basic elements of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
While democratization must take place at all levels of human society - local , national , regional and global - the special power of democratization lies in its logic , which flows from the individual human person , the one irreducible entity in world affairs and the logical source of all human rights .  
In these resolutions , the Commission continued to express its concern at the continuing and endemic violence against women and recognized that violence against women both violated and impaired or nullified the enjoyment by women of their human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In resolution 1996 / 75 , the Commission , concerned at the situation of women and children , especially regarding access to basic education for girl children and access by women to employment , called upon all parties in Afghanistan to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and also called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , economic , political and cultural life throughout the country and to ensure equal treatment to women and girls .  
In the same way , the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Rwanda stated ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 7 ) that the genocide of the Tutsis , the massacres of moderate Hutus and the renewed fighting in the civil war which followed were marked by many grave violations of international humanitarian law .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the Urban and Housing Indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in the civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , i.e . , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
Sweden has identified eight policy areas which represent the most fundamental and important challenges that have to be addressed effectively in the short and medium term in the country to ensure adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of Swedish human settlements .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
" At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that development has evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional process , with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition . "  
The delegation of Colombia considered that the reference in article 6 , paragraph 4 the representation of different forms of civilization was not only unnecessary but also constituted a dangerous precedent in the universal conception of the human rights , considering that gross human rights violations often took place using as a pretext the necessity of defending particular forms of civilization .  
The members of the Sub-Committee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia pays special attention to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms by devoting its whole chapter 3 entitled Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms to the elaboration of different human rights standards including both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , mainly following the standards elaborated in major international human rights instruments .  
enslaved national minorities such as the African _ Americans , Afro _ Brazilians , Dalits , etc . who suffer acute and persistent inequalities due to centuries of gross violation of their human rights through official State policies of enslavement , segregation , and attempted forced assimilation into the bottom levels or underclass of the dominant majority . 
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on the respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
Particular emphasis should be given to the cooperative and collaborative efforts of the landlocked and transit developing countries in dealing with the transit problems , inter alia , through improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral agreements to govern transit transport operations ; development of joint ventures in the area of transit transport ; and strengthening of institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management to effectively utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
Of the listed persistent organic pollutant ( POP ) pesticides and industrial chemicals that are or have been intentionally produced , other than for the small number of remaining recognized uses , these POPs pose unreasonable and otherwise unmanageable risks to human health and the environment such that :  
This partnership will be built on an integrated and holistic approach to human rights , in the framework of which all rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development , are perceived as of equal importance , interrelated and mutually supportive .  
The Commission also considered the report of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 17 ) , submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 1996 / 12 , concerning the problems related to the right to enjoy an adequate standard of living ; foreign debt , economic adjustment policies and their effects on the full enjoyment of human rights and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
Subsequently , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 10 , entitled " Effects on the full enjoyment of human rights of the economic adjustment policies arising from foreign debt and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development " , in which it requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session , after high-level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies and intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 17 , entitled " Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights " .  
The technical cooperation programme has focused on incorporating international human rights standards in national legal systems , developing policies and practices and building national capacities and regional structures for the promotion and protection of all human rights , democracy and the rule of law .  
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 58 on this situation decided to request " the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Zaire and on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and a member of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to carry out a joint mission to investigate allegations of massacres and other issues affecting human rights which arise from the situation prevailing in eastern Zaire since September 1996 " .  
Some people have thought that the end of the so-called cold war would be conducive to the creation of favourable conditions for equitable and healthy international relations based on mutual respect and fruitful and constructive cooperation among human communities .  
With that perception , we believe that it is high time to completely do away with the obsolete ways of thinking and acting of the past , namely , the imposition of inequitable terms of economic and trade relations , sanctions and embargoes , and so forth , which distort international relations , cause suffering to the people and seriously violate the minimum right of human beings the right to a peaceful life .  
As Mali sees it , any work towards sustainable development is above all a national responsibility , through the effective definition and application of sound macroeconomic policies , based on transparency , the pre-eminent rule of law , the practice of democracy , respect for human rights , social justice , and the participation of all in the effort of national development .  
On the basis of the cooperation agreement signed in 1976 between the two intergovernmental institutions , and strengthened in 1990 by an additional protocol creating a joint consultative commission , joint operational activities are regularly carried out by UNESCO and the Agency in the areas of basic education , education for adults , and after-school education the very foundations of an economic and social development that truly takes into account the human dimension of progress .  
Indeed , increased cooperation between the two organizations will , we hope , make it possible to establish the foundations for international cooperation that is free from ideological confrontation and resolutely determined to meet its global challenges : economic and social development ; strengthening democracy and respect for human rights ; the promotion of sustainable development while taking account of the need for environmental conservation ; the struggle against the scourge of drugs ; and the promotion of gender equality .  
At the same time , my country reaffirms the pressing importance of the promotion of wide-ranging global and regional cooperation , based on shared perceptions within a broad framework , in order to address social , economic and developmental problems and to ensure the protection of human rights and other basic freedoms .  
It describes the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 51 / 18 of 14 November 1996 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States .  
Mr . Yakovlev ( Russian Federation ) ( interpretation from Russian ) : The purposes set out in the statutes of the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) to unite parliamentarians to secure the broad participation of States in the strengthening of international peace and security , in the firm establishment of representative institutions and in the defence of human rights are largely consonant with the aspirations of the United Nations .  
Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy representative of its Group in that most important organ and to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy : the promotion of human rights , respect for international humanitarian law , respect for the principle of non-intervention , total compliance with the prohibition of the use of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal means of implementing the right of peoples to self-determination .  
A culture of peace will contribute to international cooperation for economic and social development and sustained economic growth in the developing countries of our world and permit the billions of dollars spent each year on armaments of death and mass destruction to be directed towards eradicating poverty , facilitating human development and making our world a better place to live in for all , developed and developing countries alike .  
The shared effort to build a culture of peace in the region has changed from an academic discussion to a fact of everyday life , in which we are promoting and fostering the concrete values of peace : tolerance , respect for human rights , solidarity , social justice and the rejection of violence as a method of resolving social or any other type of conflicts , all elements that are contributing to the integral development of our peoples .  
For the United Nations to make a difference and provide leadership in today 's complex world , it must recover the original meaning of the Charter by concentrating on its essential mission : maintaining international peace and security , promoting justice and international law , strengthening cooperation for development , protecting human rights and providing humanitarian assistance .  
The region \ x { e5b8 } constant focus on democracy , good governance , peace , security and nuclear disarmament ; its undertaking to take responsibility for the proper and responsible management of the environment ; the protection of fish and other marine resources ; cultural and technology exchanges ; and economic cooperation and respect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone is successfully dealing with a changing global environment .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
I believe it is time that we members of the Conference began to assert the strength of our numbers and potential influence and aired our collective opinions on the vital issues of the day , such as in the realm of global peace and security , environmental protection and conservation , sustainable development , human rights and overall economic and social development . 
When the United Nations was founded , it inscribed among the purposes set forth in its Charter the maintenance of international peace and security , the development of friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and the promotion and encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Following the peaceful changes that took place in Benin after the National Conference of Active Forces of the Nation in February 1990 , the people of Benin have been experiencing an era of democratic renewal based , inter alia , on the building of the rule of law , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development through its three component factors economic , social and environmental .  
I am among those who believe that democracy and the establishment of a human rights regime at the planetary level are both irresistible and irrepressible , and that the limits are constituted only by the limits of personal liberty itself that is , when our liberty infringes upon the liberty of our fellow human beings for , after all , we are all social beings .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
This is not to mention bolstering the role of institutions and charitable organizations , notably the Zayed charitable organization and the Red Crescent , as well as other organizations , aimed at helping them achieve their humanitarian objectives for the purpose of mobilizing local efforts in the public and private sectors , and meeting appeals to meet human needs and emergency demands in parts of the world that have been affected or are impoverished .  
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
A quick review of its recent report transmitted to the General Assembly indicates that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories expressed its grave concern at the existing human rights situation in the occupied territories as a result of the settlerist policy pursued by the current Israeli Government . 
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .  
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
At the threshold of the third millennium , it is unacceptable that poverty and pollution still dominate the daily lives of billions of people all over the world ; it is unacceptable that hostilities and hatred still create deadly new conflicts and humanitarian disasters , between and within States on all continents ; and it is unacceptable that basic human and individual rights are still widely violated through injustice by Governments and the negligence of the international community .  
The objective of sustainable development should be the integration of environmental , economic and social policies in order to meet basic human needs and to manage the environment on a sustainable basis .  
In our view , we can move towards the gradual realization of a global civil society through institutionalization of these two fundamental principles and by committing ourselves to pluralism , tolerance , dialogue among civilizations , promotion of human rights , comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development , justice and equality of opportunities as the governing norms in our interactions .  
Taking full advantage of historical affinities , cultural ties and religious bonds and sparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated manner the human and natural potential and resources of the region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of security and tranquillity .  
Terrorism is the wicked result of widespread lawlessness and the violent obstruction of public participation , which in its various forms and manifestations threatens human societies at the national , regional and international levels . 
The prolonged cycle of violence and hostilities , as a direct consequence of Israel 's continued illegal occupation of Arab territories , has brought tremendous political , economic and social sufferings and hardships to the people of the region , including the loss of human lives .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America is an integral development programme that focuses on the human being as the central and primary subject of development and gives priority to economic and social growth in our countries and to the protection and conservation of the ecosystem , as is evidenced by regional efforts in the areas of biodiversity , climate change and forests .  
We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .  
We are concerned at the constant threat to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States coming from Afghanistan ; the flow of narcotics and contraband weapons ; reports that reach us about gross violations of humanitarian law by the warring factions , including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war ; the blockade by the Taliban of the central regions of Afghanistan populated by the Hazara people , and the continuing large-scale violations of human rights , particularly the rights of women and children .  
Against the background of the continued occurrence of crimes of aggression and grave violations of human rights and humanitarian laws , all subject to punishment , the United Nations has remained either silent or incapable of taking necessary and practical measures .  
Landmines exact a high human , social , economic and environmental cost and make it difficult to create the conditions needed for sustainable development in afflicted regions .  
The international community is devoting considerable human and financial resources to assistance in mine clearing , which by its very nature is a long-term job ; to efficient mine clearance programmes in which the primary emphasis needs to be on helping the afflicted countries to develop national mine clearance capability ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of landmine victims .  
Japan , which experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently desires that the use of nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , should never be repeated and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards creating a world free of nuclear weapons .  
In themselves such weapons threaten an imbalance in nature , and many of the biological agents that can be used as weapons are capable of frustrating all the efforts made in previous decades to eradicate diseases that are highly contagious and extremely dangerous to human health worldwide .  
My predecessor , the late President Cheddi Jagan , challenged the international community on many occasions to strive for a new global human order , a development paradigm which would seek simultaneously to achieve optimal economic growth , social equity , poverty reduction and protection of the environment : a development model rooted in a partnership that seeks a better balance within and among States .  
Mr . Afful ( Ghana ) : Five years ago we met in Rio de Janeiro to elaborate integrated strategies aimed at achieving two major goals : first , to halt and reverse the negative impact of human behaviour on the physical environment , and secondly , to promote sustainable economic development in all countries .  
With this positive landscape in international relations and expectations , the United Nations embarked upon a series of unprecedented global conferences addressing key issues facing mankind , ranging from environment , human rights , population , social development , women and human settlements to food security . 
The United Nations system has a key role to play in dealing with the development migration nexus by addressing the root causes of migration ; strengthening national , regional and global efforts to achieve sustainable development ; and supporting efforts to ensure orderly migration while promoting and protecting the human rights of migrants .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
In her special report on minorities ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 8 ) the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia expressed concern at the failure of the former Yugoslavia 's political leadership to meet the challenge of governing populations which do not share the nationality , ethnicity , religion or language of the different regions ' dominant national groups .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
The decision also served as a basis for an appeal from the Federation Council to legislative ( representative ) and executive organs of State power of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation that the situation regarding the provision of supplies and equipment to the Russian penal system which had deteriorated markedly in recent years ; the conditions of detention in remand centres ( sizos ) under the control of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MVD ) constituted flagrant violations of human rights and of the law and the international obligations of the Russian Federation .  
The urgent appeal procedure is not per se accusatory , but essentially preventive in nature and purpose .  The Government concerned is merely requested to look into the matter and to take steps aimed at protecting the right to physical and mental integrity of the person concerned , in accordance with the international human rights standards .  
The four specific action areas laid out in the mission statement - operational assistance , advancement of understanding of the issues , encouragement of social and economic development through migration , and upholding the human dignity and well-being of migrants - permeate the Programme of Action , too , and provide a solid basis for IOM 's institutional commitment to moving the international consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development towards concrete action .  
While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
PHR is a Boston-based non _ governmental organization of forensic anthropologists , archaeologists , pathologists and other health professionals that seeks to use medical and scientific knowledge to protect human rights and promote accountability for violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular by investigating mass graves to identify victims of extrajudicial executions .  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
Weak technological infrastructures , a severe shortage of qualified human resources and limited financial means explain in part the persistent nature of the problem confronting many developing countries .  
Where Stockholm adopted an issue-oriented approach to pollution and non-renewable resource depletion , Rio emphasized integrated strategies to promote human development through economic growth based on sustainable management of the natural resource base .  
In implementing the Guidelines , it should be borne in mind that achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , is one of the principal objectives of the United Nations .  
One essential lesson learned in the HIV / AIDS epidemic is that universally recognized human rights standards should guide policy-makers in formulating the direction and content of HIV-related policy and form an integral part of all aspects of national and local responses to HIV / AIDS .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , States have the duty , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , in accordance with international human rights standards .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
These human rights are reinforced by the principles of participatory democracy , which assumes the involvement of PLHAs and their families , women , children and groups vulnerable to HIV / AIDS in designing and implementing programmes that will be most effective by being tailored to the specific needs of these groups .  
States should review and reform public health legislation to ensure that they adequately address the public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Whereas the Constitution in force since 1986 sets forth the responsibility of the State , as the expression of the legal and political organization of society , for promoting the common good and the consolidation of the rule of legality , security , justice , equality , freedom and peace , and defines as a central concern the promotion of the full enjoyment of human rights within a stable , permanent and popular institutional order in which governed and government act with absolute adherence to the law ,  
Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional , political , economic , social and ethnic issues , on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity ,  
Each of the High Contracting Parties guarantees to nationals of the other Parties resident in its territory , regardless of their ethnic affiliation , religion or other differences , social , economic and cultural rights and freedoms in accordance with universally accepted international human rights standards .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and inadequate access to technologies may hinder implementation and compliance with international legal instruments .  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1993 / 14 , requested the Secretary _ General to prepare basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment and economic , social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and the international financial institutions .  
The reports of Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially the final report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1992 / 16 ) , contain a wide _ ranging analysis of how structural adjustment programmes have had negative effects on a range of human rights .  
Communications under the 1503 procedure are admissible only if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they may reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; any replies received from the Governments concerned must be taken into account . 
However , recent outbreaks of cholera in Peru and a " plague scare " in India ( see box 4 ) have clearly demonstrated the human suffering and loss of life that may result from poor waste management and the disastrous effect that waste-related diseases may have on the trade and tourism vital for national economy .  
The peri-urban poor live in the most hazardous environment where their health is at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals and pathogens from domestic solid wastes and human faecal wastes .  
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , from which the relevant provisions of resolution 1995 / 34 derived , identified grave violations of human rights as involving the following : genocide , slavery , summary executions , torture , enforced disappearances , arbitrary and prolonged detention , deportation or forcible transfer of population or systematic discrimination .  
RECOGNIZING the importance of observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights instruments , as well as respect for international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts , and bearing in mind the complementarity between human rights and international humanitarian law in improving protection of the individual and respect for his dignity in situations of armed conflict ,  
Acknowledging the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning and preventive diplomacy , including through the activities of the High Commissioner for National Minorities , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , and its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
The global and regional exchange of new knowledge and expertise derived from local best practices , as well as new networks among major groups active in human settlements development will need to be supported .  
As a direct consequence of recommendations of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) in 1994 , more than a dozen multilateral and bilateral assistance agencies began discussions leading to the formation of the " Urban Forum " , to serve as a vehicle for information exchange , and joint programming in the field of sustainable human settlements development .  
Given the rates of urbanization in developing countries and subsequent new needs for services and infrastructure in human settlements , it is somewhat alarming to note that not much progress has been made on developing new mechanisms for sustained financing , on the scale required for the building , operating and maintaining of basic services and infrastructure ( see table ) . 
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
The purpose of the workshop was once again to make the international community more aware of the very serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law which are committed by Government authorities , armed groups or individuals in situations of internal disturbances , crises and tensions , including latent or low _ intensity conflicts .  
Dr Yves Sandoz , Director of International Law and Policy , International Committee of the Red Cross , noted that the starting point of the Workshop was the recognition that protection afforded to the victims of internal violence covered by international humanitarian law was inadequate ; the Workshop was an attempt to escape from the endless debate on the applicability of international law and of human rights instruments in clarifying rules applicable in all situations .  
The idea of minimum humanitarian standards , formally born in Turku , Finland , presented , in his opinion , an attempt to integrate existing human rights and humanitarian norms into one set of principles relevant to situations of internal violence .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 1 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably " with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out " .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacity in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
Moreover , mention should be made of two key issues which have a decisive influence on the human rights situation in Guatemala : the values , attitudes and social behaviours that go to create the overall context in human rights violations take place and are encouraged and tolerant ; and the main characteristics of the functioning of the State institutions responsible for protecting human rights . 
In order for the disbanding and disarming of military commissioners and CVDCs to lead to a fundamental change in the human rights situation , it is necessary to eradicate the counter-insurgency mentality , which is a source of potential human rights violations , and to promote in its place tolerance , unrestricted public participation and the effective presence of institutions for the protection of human rights .  
The Mission hopes that the Guatemalan armed forces , in the context of their considerable efforts to put an end to the internal armed conflict and to accept the institutional changes set forth in the Peace Agreements , will noticeably increase their cooperation in clarifying and punishing crimes and human rights violations in which some of their members may be implicated .  
As mentioned in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports and information on grave and widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by government agents , and abuses and atrocities committed against the life , liberty and security of individuals by members of different parties to the armed conflict in the country other than the Government of the Sudan in the areas under their control .  
In this respect , the Special Rapporteur recalls Commission resolutions 1994 / 79 , 1995 / 77 and 1996 / 73 , in which , inter alia , it called upon the Government to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with the instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoyed fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
Likewise , all political , military or police authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina violating the Dayton / Paris Accords , international law and basic human rights must be held accountable and confronted by those responsible for implementation .  
Recalling further that the International Organization for Migration assists in meeting the operational challenges of migration and that it is committed to the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society , advancing understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development through migration and to working towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants ,  
The Assembly also appealed to Governments to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other international instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
Four working groups have been constituted within the Committee to assess the state of human rights education in the following areas : primary and secondary schools ; universities and higher education ; adult education , including several professional groups ( police , armed forces , judges , teachers , social workers , etc . ) ; and activities undertaken by NGOs , associations and trade unions .  
The Plan includes clear objectives , target audience ( organized and unorganized elements of society ) , strategies ( trainers training , organization of networks , integration of human rights in all educational curricula , utilization of village-level officials to reach out to the community level , promotional campaigns including artistic and cultural activities , development of monitoring and evaluation systems , etc . ) and programmes , including the creation of a human rights training , documentation and research centre ( the Human Rights Academy ) .  
As reported in document A / 51 / 506 , draft guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national Plans of Action for human rights education .  
The High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities to strengthen national capacities in the field of human rights education ; details of these activities at the national , regional and global levels are outlined in the relevant report of the Secretary-General to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 86 ) .  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups ( prison officers ; primary and secondary school teachers ; judges and lawyers ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; journalists ; human rights monitors ) undertaken by the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
In possession of considerable information relating to alleged serious violations of human rights in Nigeria , and in the absence either of a substantive response from the Government concerning specific allegations transmitted during the year or of the opportunity to visit the country , the Special Rapporteurs were thus required at least to inform the General Assembly about the substance of allegations received and to draw such preliminary conclusions as may be possible by reference to , e.g . , declared laws and acknowledged practices .  
The proclamation of a unilateral declaration of independence and the creation of the Bougainville Interim Government followed ; the situation has not yet returned to normal and , even though the naval blockade has been lifted , the population in some areas continues to be deprived of basic requirements and many allegations of serious violations of human rights continue to be reported . 
The representative of the National Commission on Human Rights of Cameroon stated that at the regional level , other African national human rights institutions had entrusted Cameroon 's National Commission with the task of planning , preparing and hosting the first African Regional Conference of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights with the objective , among others , of encouraging States in the region to create their own national institutions ( see also paras .  25 _ 27 ) .  
In its continuous search for new channels for promoting and protecting human rights , the National Commission had initiated contacts with religious bodies , and had become deeply involved in investigating inter _ ethnic land conflicts which had assumed alarming dimensions .  
The Conference sowed the seeds of a new form of cooperation between national institutions in Africa ; it met in the context of the tenth anniversary of the African Charter of Human and Peoples ' Rights and addressed a subject of vital importance for Africa , that of strengthening human rights mechanisms which can act as a buffer between the public authorities and civil society , which promote the process of democratization and guarantee the rule of law .  
It is for this reason that the expert has urged the political authorities and representatives of civil society , especially the Plate-forme des organisations ha \ x { 9ba0 } iennes des droits de lhomme , to develop a sweeping programme of civic education and human rights training and to introduce legal services into rural areas .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that rebels , Tutsi militias or Tutsi groups from the displaced persons ' camps accompanying the military , are all equally guilty of murderous acts that result in grave violations of international humanitarian law and human rights .  
In view of the accelerated deterioration of the situation in Burundi and the current crisis afflicting the Great Lakes region , the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that , during the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , a special day should be devoted to considering all the problems confronting the subregion , culminating in the adoption of a joint resolution , in accordance with the wish expressed by the three Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Burundi , Rwanda and Zaire .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Recommends that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty and to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty and the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
The basic mandate established by the Commission for the Sub _ Commission is ( a ) to undertake studies , particularly in the light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights concerning the prevention of discrimination of any kind relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and the protection of racial , national , religious and linguistic minorities , ( b ) to perform any other functions which may be entrusted to it by the Economic and Social Council or the Commission on Human Rights .  
The input of the United Nations University ( UNU ) to the preparatory process included international conferences on world cities and urban future , and human settlements in the changing global political and economic processes .  
The participants stressed their role in the development and future of human settlements and announced the establishment of a permanent coordinating structure , to be known as the World Association of Cities and Local Authorities Coordination , to coordinate their partnership with the United Nations system and with other international agencies .  
The growing international concern at such problems as freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention , protection against all forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , circumstances and conditions of detention and imprisonment , and humanization of criminal justice were cornerstones of the protection of human rights .  
Those topics should be related to the most urgent problems , demanding concerted action of particular importance , such as the struggle against transnational organized crime and terrorism , which had a detrimental impact on the full enjoyment of human rights and constituted a serious danger to peace and security , at both the national and international levels .  
However , the ever-growing demand on the United Nations human rights programme to engage in such areas as confidence _ building measures , technical cooperation , education , monitoring , etc . makes it indispensable to establish an adequate and reliable mix of regular budget resources and voluntary contributions from Governments and private entities .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Gender mainstreaming in such substantive areas as economic and social matters , peace and security , human rights , sustainable development and humanitarian affairs requires an institutional culture that is conducive to such mainstreaming .  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , 1 the International Covenants on Human Rights2 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of internationally recognized safeguards , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice and the absence of due process of law , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but that face economic hardship ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
The key elements are : ( a ) the creation of an effective and professional human resource management organization ; ( b ) implementation of human resource measures sensitive to a more equitable gender-balance in decision-making ; ( c ) increased efficiency of transaction-based services ; ( d ) maintenance of competitive benefits and conditions of service ; ( e ) foundations for continuous learning and learning opportunities for key staff .  
To make sustainable human development ( SHD ) a reality in this new context , a more integrated approach is required , one that allows economic growth , social equity and environmental sustainability to move forward together .  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Also strongly urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression and assembly , the right to fair trial and the protection of the rights of persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities , and to put an end to violations of the right to life and integrity of the human being , to the practices of torture , abuse of women , forced labour and forced relocations and to enforced disappearances and summary executions ;  
Noting that , at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , held in April , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to support the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
In addition , it exceeded the mandate of a human rights working group by recommending detailed social , political and economic programmes at the national and international levels , and guidelines for international cooperation , some of which were not directly linked to the impact of structural adjustment programmes .  
In the context of the discussion of paragraph ( 3 ) , a question was raised as to whether the reference to keys of natural and legal persons provided sufficient guidance in situations where cryptographic keys were issued directly to electronic devices , or used by such devices , in the absence of direct human intervention .  
It is a dynamic long-term process , including economic and social development as essential elements , seen in perspectives that may change over time , and leading to improved quality of life for all human beings , the eradication of poverty and the reduction of inequality .  
Road transport and other forms of transportation to a lesser extent , impose social costs in the form of accidents ; damage to human health from particulate matter , carbon monoxide , lead , volatile organic compounds and other pollutants ; congestion ; noise nuisance ; community severance , the " barrier effect " ; local air pollution ; transboundary air pollution from nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides ; and global warming from carbon dioxide emissions .  
Recalling also and concurring with the conclusions of and recommendations made by recent international conferences on the human rights of women and girl children , in particular with respect to the violation of those rights through sexual and economic exploitation for the profit of recruiters , traffickers and crime syndicates , as well as other illegal activities related to trafficking , such as forced domestic labour , false marriages , child marriages , clandestine employment and false adoption ,  
In the statement at its fifty _ second session , the Commission expressed its deep concern that the disproportionate use of force by the Russian Federation armed forces was continuing to lead to grave violations of human rights , as well as of international humanitarian law .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
Recalling the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annexed to General Assembly resolution 49 / 60 of 9 December 1994 , in which the Assembly declared that acts , methods and practices of terrorism constituted a grave violation of the purpose and principles of the United Nations , and might pose a threat to international peace and security , jeopardize friendly relations among States , hinder international cooperation and aim at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic bodies of society ,  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
This has arisen from our understanding of the mandate of the Rapporteurs as derived from the enabling resolutions , the standard terms of reference for fact-finding missions of special rapporteurs / representatives of the Commission on Human Rights , existing practice and the emerging human rights jurisprudence governing similar missions .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
ESCWA reports an increase in the number of projects implemented on the basis of the TCDC modality , and has cited two examples , namely , on local community development in rural areas , and on preparatory assistance for regional support to the national pursuit of sustainable human development .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights ,  
Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Expressing its grave concern at the enormous human suffering and material damage sustained by the Libyan Arab people and neighbouring peoples as a result of the maintenance of the coercive measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriya under Security Council resolutions 748 ( 1992 ) and 883 ( 1993 ) ,  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining its multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at the universal and effective respect of all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Stressing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis , as reaffirmed in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
The active involvement of women at the national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health ; in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
Reiterating the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action which states that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,  
Calls upon relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to make , within their respective mandates and fields of action , an assessment of , and to put forward pertinent conclusions on , the state of implementation and the impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Mindful that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights ,  
Reaffirming that activities to improve public knowledge in the field of human rights are essential to the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the United Nations set out in Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , education and information are essential to the achievement of lasting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , Recalling previous General Assembly and its own resolutions on this subject ,  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Concerned that implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the Beijing Platform for Action remains far from the objectives set forth in the two documents and , therefore , calls once again for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status and human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms ;  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Welcomes the efforts of the High Commissioner to create an environment viable for return in post _ conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , broad _ based programmes of human rights education as well as the strengthening of local non _ governmental organizations through programmes of advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Calls upon the Government of the Sudan to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with those instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoy fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
To condemn the persistent Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied regions of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa , as exemplified by the kidnapping and arbitrary arrest of civilians and the destruction of their homes , the confiscation of their property and their expulsion from their land , as well as by the shelling of peaceful villages and urban areas ;  
If a serious political dialogue is re-established among the main Somali factions , we sincerely hope that a national reconciliation package will include the following measures : respect for human rights , and an end to the appalling situation still prevailing in the country ; the establishment of , and strict adherence to , the rule of law ; the creation of a national army and a national police force ; and the promise of elections , whenever feasible , to ensure the primacy of democracy .  
The difficulties experienced in the search for mines and remnants of war on Libyan territory due to the lack of maps and precise data on location , number and type , in addition to the fact that they are scattered at random over an extensive area , make it hard to give a comprehensive and precise report on the human and material losses caused by landmines and remnants of war in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya . 
Although the aim of producing the above-mentioned report ( which was prepared by a United Nations expert ) was not to study the problem of landmines and remnants of war and their effect on the future of the country and its development , the references to and preliminary estimates of war damages make it clear beyond any doubt that what was suffered by Libya during the military operations , and the landmines and explosives left by those operations , represented a human and material disaster of incalculable proportions . 
The limited human , technical and material national resources have been concentrated on sweeping areas where mines and remnants of war are known to be present , and where their location has been established by citizens ' reports on the accidents they have caused or by companies carrying out development projects .  
Indicators and best practices ( global urban observatory ) ; policy framework for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; global analysis of national enabling legislation and public policy formulation required for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; and human settlement conditions and trends : country profiles and statistical analysis ;  
The Convention envisages that , to be effective , this equality must be achieved within the framework of a political system in which each citizen enjoys the right to vote and be elected at genuine periodic elections held on the basis of universal suffrage and by secret ballot , in such a way as to guarantee the free expression of the will of the electorate , as provided for under international human rights instruments , such as article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
By resolution 8 ( XXIII ) of 16 March 1967 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to give annual consideration to the item entitled Question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including policies of racial discrimination and segregation and of apartheid , in all countries , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 36 _ 44 above ) . 
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 24 , welcomed with satisfaction the second interim report on the question of the impunity of perpetrators of violations of human rights ( economic , social and cultural rights ) prepared by Mr . El Hadji Guiss ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 15 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
At its forty-fifth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1993 / 40 , decided to entrust Mr . Asbj \ x { 9de8 } n Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels , taking also into account matters related to the realization of the right to development , with a view to determining how most effectively to strengthen activities in this field .  
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa , ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
The Commission on Human Rights , at its fifty-second session , in its decision 1996 / 104 , decided to recommend to the Economic and Social Council , in the light of the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , to be held in Istanbul in June 1996 , to authorize the holding of an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions with a view to developing comprehensive human rights guidelines on development-based displacement .  
At its forty _ eighth session the Sub _ Commission had before it the revised set of basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law prepared by Mr . van Boven ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 17 ) .  
In its decision 1996 / 119 , the Sub _ Commission , having considered that report decided to request the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its forty _ ninth session a revised version of the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity contained in annex II of the final report , taking into account the comments and observations received .  
The Sub-Commission , at its forty-eighth session , in its resolution 1996 / 30 , requested the Special Rapporteur to update the list of States which have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency with a view to its consideration by the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session , and requested him to submit final conclusions on the protection of human rights during states of emergency , together with specific recommendations as to how this question should be dealt with in the future .  
At its fifty _ third session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1997 / 71 , entitled Human rights and bioethics , requested the Sub _ Commission , under the agenda item Human rights and scientific and technological developments , to consider ways of ensuring that the life sciences develop in a manner respectful of human rights and beneficial to humanity as a whole and to make recommendations to that effect .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Review the implementation and effectiveness of the programme of work of the secretariat , and make recommendations to the Commission about future programmes of work , and in this process ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked and Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development , socially and economically disadvantaged groups and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Work closely with other subsidiary organs of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , coordinate activities with them , and ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked , Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a more fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
In addition , the emerging human rights norms relating to the right to development , intergenerational rights , the right to peace , and the right to a safe and healthy environment are areas in which indigenous peoples are beginning to influence old thinking and bring about the progressive development of standards that are more sensitive , responsive and useful to indigenous peoples and humankind generally .  
Of the major changes that have occurred in this century , there is no doubt that one of the most transcendent and revolutionary has been the gradual shift in the area of human rights away from the leading role traditionally played by the State and towards a new vision focused more on human beings than on the authorities wielding power .  
Against this background it is easy to understand the huge significance of the study completed by Mrs . Nicole Questiaux in 1982 , [ 1 ] which determined the conditions and requirements on which the legality of a state of emergency depended and which ensured that proper application thereof is compatible with respect for human rights and with democratic forms of government .  
The second obstacle was the fallacious and perverse argument that the country was experiencing internally a state of dirty , unconventional war compelling the authorities to suspend the exercise of human rights and to claim , before international forums , that international humanitarian law conventions were not applicable since the situation did not involve an international armed conflict and even less a declared war .  
In addition , as the work of both the Human Rights Committee and the regional monitoring bodies and the Special Rapporteur 's experience have shown , international monitoring is not only active but has been reinforced precisely because situations are involved , as has already been demonstrated , human rights stand a greater risk of being violated and require greater protection .  
In the light of the major changes that have occurred in the past 50 years in the sphere of human rights , it is a little surprising to recall that until very recently , and throughout virtually all mankind 's history , the absolute power to determine which rights they allowed their subjects and to establish internal mechanisms for protecting them lay with sovereigns ( monarchs , emperors , etc . ) and later with States .  
It was only in this century , and more particularly after the Second World War , that human rights took on an international dimension as a result of the incorporation of their norms into a great variety of regional and universal treaties and conventions , thereby becoming one of the most dynamic and revolutionary branches of contemporary international public law .  
Fortunately , the opposing view prevailed , as it would have been rather superfluous and even contradictory to promote human rights monitoring activities at international level in ordinary situations , while at the same time denying their applicability during times of crisis or instability , though aware that it is precisely in such situations that the worst violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms most frequently occur . 
This is why both the domestic law of States ( whatever its theoretical foundations ) and international law accept that in such circumstances the competent authorities may suspend the exercise of certain rights for the sole and unique purpose of restoring normality and guaranteeing the exercise of the most fundamental human rights .  
The protective nature of the most fundamental human rights and the defence of institutions which safeguard them and which justify the temporary suspension of certain rights and freedoms explain why international monitoring bodies with increasing precision and clarity have been tying the exercise of this exceptional measure to the defence of democracy , which is understood not only as a particular form of political organization that it is unlawful to attack but as a system that lays down absolute limits for the unfailing observance of certain essential human rights .  
Where this appears most clearly is in severe crisis situations involving relatively serious armed conflicts , where the international law on human rights and international humanitarian law are applied in a simultaneous and complementary manner .  
In short , according to the criteria laid down by the Inter _ American Court , the sole valid justification for states of emergency is the defence of the democratic system , which is understood as a system that affords absolute protection to the constant maintenance of certain essential rights of the human person .  
In most cases , the Committee determined that merely to report the adoption of urgent security measures ( implying severe restrictions on the functioning of institutions and the exercise of human rights ) , on the ground of the alleged existence of a state of emergency , was not sufficient , in conformity with the terms of article 4 of the Covenant , to invoke the right of derogation provided for in strictly defined cases .  
The most valuable lesson that can be drawn from the practice of the international monitoring bodies and from the Special Rapporteur 's own experience is the certainty that , to the extent that the norms and principles governing the state of emergency are respected , its impact on the functioning of the institutions , the validity of the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights will necessarily be limited and compatible with a democratic system of government .  
The Special Rapporteur suggests that special rapporteurs and working groups pay particular attention to the impact of emergency situations on the specific area covered by their respective mandates and that , as the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has repeatedly stated , they should avail themselves of the valuable collaboration which the Special Rapporteur on human rights and states of emergency would be able to provide , in the event that such a Special Rapporteur were to be appointed by the Commission . 
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
While the international law of human rights is , indeed , addressed to the behaviour of States and deals with acts or omissions of government officials 18 / or their agents , modern developments of international humanitarian law , 19 / recent authoritative pronouncements such as indicated in the introductory section of this working paper , 20 / and a respectable body of theory 21 / tend to embrace elements leading to some modification of the traditional position that private individuals or groups are not capable of violating human rights .  
All these elements should , in fact , be sought out and thoroughly explored in order to assess objectively whether ( and , eventually , to what extent ) international human rights law is moving beyond the traditional dichotomy of individual versus State , beyond the duty of States to respect and ensure the observance of human rights , and towards the creation of obligations applicable also to private individuals and other non _ State actors , including liberation movements and terrorist organizations .  
Consequently , and as a next step in its further consideration of the subject , the Sub _ Commission may wish to address _ in the context of the simultaneous interest of these issues for human rights _ the United Nations and other international and regional efforts towards the control of terrorism , as well as measures undertaken at national level , based on information available from all sources .  
It is becoming clear that a State that can address complex social problems , enhance participation in public life and safeguard the rule of law , due process and respect for human rights is a State which " promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable , people-centred development " , in the terms of resolution 50 / 225 .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
The use of a flexible , investigative and monitoring process comparable to that established by ECOSOC resolution 1503 ( XLVIII ) should be examined in the context of population transfers , together with the existing regional machinery for the protection of human rights , including quasi _ legal and political processes such as the Helsinki process , and the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity . 75 .  The Sub-Commission should look into the possibility of establishing an international trust fund for the rehabilitation of the survivors of population transfer .  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
In this spirit , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , deeply alarmed at the widening gap between the rich and the poor , adopted resolution 1993 / 40 in which it entrusted Mr . A . Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels .  
Noting that the current , severe maldistribution of income prevents millions from enjoying economic and social rights and that gross inequalities prevent social harmony , Mr . Eide added that the focus of his report was rather on the impact of different structures of international and national income distribution on human rights . 
In the preliminary report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 14 ) to the Sub-Commission , the Special Rapporteur underlined that income distribution , both internationally and nationally , was the principal indicator of social integration and of the fulfilment of minimum requirements in respect of economic , social and cultural rights , enabling human beings to live in society . 
It was asserted that greater communication between societies would bring growing homogenization of accepted and acceptable " standards " and levels of realization of human rights in general and of economic , social and cultural rights in particular .  
The final objective of the report is to signal the challenges to the human rights system posed by the process of globalization , especially in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The rights of individuals established in codified human rights documents thus constitute the only general criterion for the establishment of minimum acceptable or unacceptable standards in economic and social matters at the national and international levels .  
Pressure for " concrete " results is observed and behavioural models are sought among " profit-making " enterprises without there necessarily being any understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of the processes of human and community development , which by definition cover a more prolonged timespan .  
A framework is thus taking shape of " permanent and persistent violations " of the economic , social and cultural rights of a substantial and increasing majority of the world 's population , threatening the solidarity of international humanitarian principles and human rights .  
Moreover , societies that are increasingly divided into two blocs , the rich and the poor , could not fully enjoy the benefits of their accomplishments because they will constantly be threatened by social strife and internal turmoil , a situation not conducive to the promotion and observance of human rights .  
Among the many activities of the Observer Mission , human rights , humanitarian and public information programmes will be necessary to create conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development .  
It recommended a profound judicial reform that would give the judicial system the capacity to sanction violations of human rights ; constitutional reforms in a number of areas ; the strengthening of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights ; the adoption of reforms in the armed forces and in the public security sector ; the investigation of illegal armed groups , or death squads ; and concrete measures to achieve national reconciliation .  
UNDP , working in close collaboration with ONUSAL , MINUSAL and ONUV and in consultation with the beneficiary organizations , formulated and implemented priority technical assistance programmes in the areas of : administration of justice , public security , reintegration of former combatants and demobilized soldiers , the Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and War-Disabled , the protection of human rights through institutional support of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights , and democratic participation .  
In this respect , they reaffirmed all 10 principles referred to in the Helsinki Final Act : sovereign equality ; respect for rights inherent in sovereignty ; refraining from the threat or use of force ; inviolability of frontiers ; territorial integrity of States ; peaceful settlement of disputes ; non-intervention in internal affairs ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief ; equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; cooperation among States ; and fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law .  
At the national , regional and international levels , judicial human rights bodies continued to develop the legal framework of refugee protection , further defining the scope of obligations towards asylum-seekers and adding content to the rule of non-refoulement , also in respect of persons facing a substantial risk of torture .  
Having due regard to all relevant definitions of the practice of forced evictions under international human rights provisions and instruments , the present Guidelines apply to instances of forced evictions in which there are acts and / or omissions involving the coerced and involuntary removal of individuals , groups and communities from their homes and / or lands and common property resources they occupy or are dependent upon , thus eliminating or limiting the possibility of an individual , group or community residing or working in a particular dwelling , residence or place .  
If , as a last resort , States consider themselves compelled to undertake proceedings of expropriation or compulsory acquisition , such action shall be : ( a ) determined and envisaged by law and norms regarding forced eviction , insofar as these are consistent with internationally recognized human rights ; ( b ) solely for the purpose of protecting the general welfare in a democratic society ; ( c ) reasonable and proportional ; and ( d ) in accordance with the present Guidelines .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development . "  
Confirming that at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , the international community recognized that there was a lack of knowledge about mountain ecosystems and called for renewed international and regional cooperation to develop an integrated approach for conserving , upgrading and using the land , water , plant , animal and human resources and promoting alternative livelihood opportunities for mountain inhabitants with a view to improving their living standards ,  
Encourages Governments and intergovernmental organizations to coordinate regional and international cooperation and facilitate the exchange of information and experience among the specialized agencies and relevant international and regional organizations , research institutions and non _ governmental organizations on the issues related to mountain regions , including the manageability and interaction of mountains and the economy , the impact of mountains on the socio _ economic development of countries , the sustainable human development and the like ;  
It is obvious that the Turkish selective quotations are intended to divert attention from the continuous violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Cyprus by Turkey and , in particular , of the few Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the occupied territory .  
The representative informed the Committee that plans now in place to allow pregnant teenagers to continue their education included working with fathers as appropriate and the provision of functional literacy skills programmes , skills training , parenting classes and family life education , which involved family planning and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) education . 
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .  
The international community must continue to provide technical , economic and financial assistance to support political stability , balanced development , the establishment of democratic institutions and respect for human rights .  
The individual elements of a culture of peace are therefore : non-violence and respect for human rights , respect and solidarity among all peoples and dialogue between cultures , the linkage of peace to democratic participation and sustainable human development , the free flow and sharing of information and knowledge , contribution to conflict-prevention and post-conflict peace-building , and equality between women and men , all best supported through projects in which people take an active role in transforming their values , attitudes and behaviours .  
I have the honour to inform you that your letter dated 8 August 1997 ( S / 1997 / 633 ) concerning your decision to appoint Mr . Reed Brody ( United States of America ) as the third member of the investigative team to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 has been brought to the attention of the members of the Council .  
Debt-relief measures for the least developed countries would help to release scarce resources in order to boost social and human development expenditure and to finance investment in critical economic restructuring in the short term and medium term .  
The right to development was one of the most important human rights , transcending both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights and standing at the nexus formed by democracy , development and respect for human rights .  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
Rising inequality , both within and among countries , and the highly uneven translation of economic growth into equitable human development are causes for major concern for national policy makers and the international community as poverty and social exclusion manifest themselves in , and further exacerbate , crime , disease and urban decay .  
An indigenous participant from South America reported on some activities carried on in the field of indigenous rights and human rights : seminars and workshops had been organized and a number of publications had been distributed with a view to improving understanding of international legal instruments regarding indigenous peoples and monitoring their implementation .  
The transnationals that work in the countries where there are no internal legal frameworks and / or administrative mechanisms that are capable of enforcing and / or providing such involvement of indigenous communities should accept a constructive obligation to respect the guidelines and the fundamental human rights of indigenous peoples . 
The General Assembly is encouraged to direct all of its committees and bodies and draw the attention of other bodies of the United Nations system to the need to mainstream a gender perspective systematically into all areas of their work , in particular in areas such as macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters ( para .  12 ) .  
It is based on the contributions requested by the Division for the Advancement of Women , which focused on additional action taken by the relevant entities in support of the implementation of the Platform for Action since the submission of the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / 51 / 322 ) and on means of implementation , including new human resources , financial means and structural changes .  
Convinced that the increasing danger of racism and racial discrimination must be met by a concerted response by the international community commensurate with the threat posed to the realization of the objective of the Charter of the United Nations to promote universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Decides to authorize Ms . Ferero Ucros to prepare , without financial implications , a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering .  
The objectives of the programme are as follows : ( a ) to establish regional , national and local consensus among the main protagonists ( Governments , civil society , cooperating community and United Nations agencies ) with regard to goals and action for sustainable human development ; ( b ) to strengthen the technical capacity of the programmes and promote joint action by the United Nations system in relation to the strategy ; ( c ) to consolidate ongoing local development processes ; ( d ) to transfer experience at the international level .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
Convinced that the increasing danger of racism and racial discrimination must be met by a concerted response by the international community commensurate with the threat posed to the realization of the objective of the Charter of the United Nations to promote universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining the multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
Acknowledging that indigenous peoples in many countries have been deprived of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and that many of the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples are linked to the historical and continuing deprivation of ancestral rights over lands , territories and resources ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the Purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply concerned that understanding of human nature has been significantly modified by the rapid rise of developments in biotechnology as a science , particularly in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes , and that indigenous people are most vulnerable to the risk of being singled out for human genetic research and human gene patenting by the biotechnology industry ,  
Takes note of the work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization in the field of the human genome to complete the preliminary draft of a universal declaration on the human genome and human rights , a standard _ setting framework urgently needed to ensure that such research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human dignity , in particular for the dignity and way of life of indigenous peoples ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
Having considered the final report of Mr . Leandro Despouy on Protection of human rights during states of emergency and the tenth annual list of States which , since 1 January 1985 , have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 19 and Add . 1 ) ,  
As a result , the aim of the Funds political empowerment programme is to address the obstacles and challenges that prevent women from contributing their vision to a new world of equality , development and peace and from participating in its construction under the framework of universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated human rights .  
Operationally , the UNIDO work programmes were based on the following thematic priorities : formulation of strategies and institution-building for global economic integration ; innovation , productivity and quality to increase competitiveness ; industrial information , investment and technology promotion ; human resource development with special attention to the integration of women in industrial development ; rural industrial development ; and industry-related environment and energy issues .  
During the FAO regional conference for Latin America and the Caribbean , held in Paraguay in July 1996 , it had been determined that , based on available natural , human and technological resources , the region could set two complementary goals for the year 2010 : to reduce malnutrition from 15 per cent in the period 1991-1992 to 6 per cent , and to ensure that the nutrition supply should be no less than 2,700 calories per person per day in any country .  
The attempt to change the meaning of food security from being a basic human right to mere participation in the global markets , which by definition excluded all those lacking adequate purchasing power , was contrary to that principle .  
In line with the objectives of the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa , the international community and the United Nations system must strengthen industrial development cooperation for African industrialization in the areas of industrial policy , investment , transfer of technology , institutional and human resource development , and the development of small - and medium-scale industry .  Support was also required for the promotion of regional and sub-regional cooperation as a practical means of enlarging markets and establishing multinational projects .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Taking note also of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
This duty is impaired when institutions fail to comply with their legal obligation to provide , in a timely manner , for appropriate means of guaranteeing full respect for human rights or of carrying out prompt , exhaustive and effective investigations when such rights are violated .  
Activities will focus on strengthening government capacity , at the central and local levels , for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform and institutional and human resource development ; improving performance in the public sector ; and introducing efficient and accountable managerial systems , structures and information technologies in accordance with national development objectives .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their international obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , as established at the Managua meeting , is an ambitious and comprehensive initiative guided by the principles of respect for life ; peace ; democracy ; the observance of human rights ; economic integration ; and the responsibility of succeeding generations for sustainable development ( A / 49 / 580-S / 1994 / 1217 , annex I ) .  
In the area of economic and social development , UNDP has focused on the formulation and implementation of a new initiative known as the Programme for the Promotion of Human Sustainable Development in Central America ( PROGRESS / CA ) , aiming at establishing regional , local and national consensus among the main social actors ( Governments , civil societies , international donors / NGOs and United Nations agencies ) on goals and actions towards human sustainable development .  
With regard to the efforts to restructure UNHCR , his delegation supported the measures to increase its efficiency , while stressing that any lasting solution would have to be based on national , regional and international solidarity , which entailed the mobilization of considerable financial and human resources .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
It was agreed that inter-agency coordination could be pursued by creating an interactive electronic mail network for information-sharing to serve as the medium for inter-agency contacts ; preparing an inventory of social programmes and projects ; conducting joint human resource training activities ; expanding to the rest of the region the system developed by CEFIR for observing the behaviour of social actors in integration ; and comparing the various work programmes in order to identify issues appropriate for inter-agency cooperation .  
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed that all human beings were born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone was entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration without distinction of any kind such as race , colour or national origin , yet violations continued daily .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
The international community was currently facing different , although not unfamiliar , problems , namely , the break-up of political entities , conflicts based on religious ideology , the repercussions of the apartheid policies applied in the past and human rights violations engendered by racial and ethnic hatred .  
The campaign to promote awareness of human rights and humanitarian principles was also worth mentioning for , unless discipline was maintained among the armed forces and unless universal ethical principles were upheld , protection of victims could never be established on a solid basis . 
Successful enterprise development is affected by a conducive economic environment in terms of the macroeconomic , regulatory and legal frameworks , the structural characteristics of the national economy , the degree of market development , the institutional framework , the infrastructural and human resource base and the quality and coherence of government policies .  
Rather , we are appealing to the conscience of the continent , as well as to individual consciences , asking that these acts of violence not be repeated , that the truth be known , that justice prevail , that the human person be respected and that the United Nations and the non-governmental organizations be permitted to work under the protection of full respect for international humanitarian law .  
This view includes situations of extreme poverty and economic and social under-development , human rights violations , massive flows of refugees , civil wars resulting from ethnic conflicts , extreme degradation of the environment , terrorism , and even certain socio-political phenomena such as corruption , drug trafficking and international crime ; it also includes religious fundamentalism , which in recent years has aggressively invaded several regions of the world . 
Africa now needs to address three main requirements : first , the striving for the peaceful settlement of conflicts occurring in a number of its regions , as well as for urgent solutions to the problems of refugees ; secondly , the achievement of economic and social development and the enhancement of integration , both at the level of the continent as a whole and on the level of subregional groupings ; and thirdly , the turn to democratization and to the respect for human rights by African communities .  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
I am pleased to announce my own plans to visit the continent before the end of the year , to meet with leaders and people there and to make as real as I can America 's commitment to stand with Africans as they realize long-delayed aspirations for true freedom , growing prosperity and simple human dignity .  
This Union will enable all Central American social sectors to take full advantage of the region 's strategic geographical location , economic potential , vast ecological wealth and robust and abundant human resources within the new international order , and to confront the challenges of the next millennium .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
We are convinced that a renewed effort to promote complete , integrated and democracy-based education in Latin America and the Caribbean in a context of growing interdependence , technological development and globalization will help strengthen democratic civic culture on the basis of the full and effective enjoyment of human rights .  
It also invited all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardized the friendly relations among States , hindered development of international cooperation and resulted in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
The devastation and the destruction , as well as the human tragedy resulting from years and years of unrelenting ethnic hatred , witnessed in the fragmented former Yugoslavia ; the division of Cyprus ; the sanctions imposed by the Security Council on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , which continue to have far-reaching effects on neighbouring countries ; the recent turmoil in Albania ; and political instability in some countries because of rampant extremist fundamentalist elements , these are matters of great concern to all the littoral States of the Mediterranean .  
At the social level , living conditions are characterized by poor nutrition , resulting from low purchasing power , and poor health conditions , with widespread disease , including tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
This high level of attrition at a stage when continuing learning is both optimal and desirable represents , from an educational and manpower planning perspective , a wasted national opportunity to expand and strengthen the human resource pool for the enhancement of national productivity .  
Without seeking to be exhaustive in the present interim report , the Special Rapporteur would nevertheless like to bring to the attention of the General Assembly a number of allegations of human rights violations transmitted to him during the period under consideration , particularly as regards the right to life and physical integrity , arrests and arbitrary detentions and torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .  
In the broad context of the complicated general situation in Africa , the Security Council decided to devote special attention to the situation in the Republic of Sierra Leone , as part of the international community 's effort over the past three years through the United Nations , in coordination with the Organization of African Unity , subregional organizations and the Governments of the region to restore pluralistic and representative democracy , and promote respect for human rights and peace and national reconciliation in that country . 
The City and its Palestinian population have been subjected to human rights violations resulting from concerted and accelerated efforts by the Israeli authorities to create facts on the ground , such as those affecting the demographic and geographic balance in the city , which would be , if allowed to continue unabated , clearly to the advantage of its Jewish population and have negative implications for the Palestinians , placing them before a fait accompli and pre-empting their future efforts to challenge Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem . 
A key component of its work is to assist national institutions in playing an effective role in the promotion and protection of human rights at the national level and to forge close links with international bodies pursuing the same goal .  
The present report has highlighted the growing role of independent national institutions in promoting and protecting human rights , a factor increasingly recognized as important in ensuring effective implementation of international human rights standards at the national level .  
The Assembly appealed to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights3 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
Further , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
The main objectives of the Institute are : to raise public awareness for human rights ; to further educate civil servants , teachers , lawyers on human rights ; to strengthen human rights education in the Cyprus educational system at all levels ; to strengthen the capacity of the mass media for human rights education by appropriate means ; to promote the active engagement of national non-governmental organizations in the realization of the goals of the Decade ; and to establish a human rights library in order to enhance public awareness .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups , such as human rights monitors , judges and lawyers , prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , journalists , and national and local non-governmental organizations undertaken by the Office and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
The aims of the training course were to familiarize participants with the international and regional systems of protection of human rights and procedures to be followed for the preparation of relevant reports , and to provide participants with the requested training tools in order to guarantee an element of continuity through the replication of training at the national level for relevant governmental departments .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty and the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society , and the creation of more and better jobs , requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
The need for an integrated and intersectoral approach to health strategies has been recognized , as well as the importance of strengthening national and international efforts to prevent and combat epidemics and other diseases that are endemic in many developing countries , and in particular to address malaria and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) more effectively .  
National plans of action and other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by Governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing owing to a number of complex factors which include armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources and environmental degradation .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
Those countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies that take into account social development goals , as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to the Agenda .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management effectively to utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
To recognize the ethnic and cultural existence of Argentine indigenous peoples ; to guarantee respect for identity and the right to bilingual and cross-cultural education ; to recognize the legal personality of indigenous communities and community ownership of the land they traditionally occupy ; to establish regulations for the handing over of other land that is suitable and sufficient for human development , none such land being inalienable , transmissible or subject to taxes or charges ; and to guarantee their participation in the management of their natural resources and other matters of interest to them .  
In resolution 1997 / 57 , section IX , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on the prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and other vulnerable groups , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
By monitoring sensitive trials and intervening with the responsible authorities , the Special Rapporteur and staff of UNHCR have played an active role in supporting the efforts of the Human Rights Coordination Centre of OHR to deter human rights abuses and build confidence in the legal system .  
The present legal and institutional framework through which legislative , executive and judicial powers continued to be exercised in Myanmar was not in conformity with established international norms governing human rights .  
This structured programme of technical cooperation in the field of human rights involves the principal elements of the administration of justice and legal reform ; penitentiary administration ; training and institutional support ; and genocide response and vulnerable groups .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
One of the principal reasons cited for the current situation of human rights in Afghanistan was the lack of central power , governmental institutions , unified legal system and a clear social , political and economic system .  
It was stated that numerous human rights violations stemmed from the absence of a functioning State system , including social development programmes and a national treasury to pay the salaries of civil servants .  
An important medium of education and the heightening of awareness has been the " New Home , New Life " radio series developed by Mr . John Butt of the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) , which incorporates cultural , social , economic , human rights , peace , health , conflict resolution , mine awareness and other issues of vital daily importance for the population of Afghanistan .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
By monitoring sensitive trials and intervening with the responsible authorities , the Special Rapporteur and staff of the High Commissioner for Human Rights have played an active role in supporting the efforts of the Human Rights Coordination Centre of the Office of the High Representative to deter human rights abuses and build confidence in the legal system .  
The IPTF investigation concluded that the west Mostar police had used excessive force , in violation of national and international human rights standards , and that they had attempted to cover up the facts of the incident .  
If , by a democratic regime , we mean one in which human rights are respected , power is vested in the Government by the people through free elections , there is a separation of powers , the law is enforced by the authorities , there is equality under the law , the armed forces and police are at the service of everyone , the courts perform their functions independently , political parties express themselves freely , and there is freedom of the press , then this report shows that none of these conditions are being met .  
The new State structure , based on an omnipresent state party ( although this is denied ) , the absence of a short - , medium - or long-term democratic project , and the fact that there is nobody capable of controlling the exercise of power all lead the Special Rapporteur to conclude that the Congolese people do not enjoy , and will not enjoy in the foreseeable future , the human right to democracy .  
In view of the continuing widespread violations of human rights in Kosovo as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the opening of an office of the High Commissioner in Prishtina , as well as an increased presence of other international organizations , would be indispensable for gathering reliable information on future human rights developments .  
Since governmental and non-governmental organizations and individuals have important roles to play in ensuring that human rights are respected , national human rights education strategies and plans of action should be developed and implemented by a creative mixture of all of such entities .  These Guidelines are not intended as a blueprint for a nationally coordinated effort in human rights education .  
The study might also include ( a ) knowledge about human rights among the general population , as well as potential target groups ; ( b ) social , political and economic conditions relevant to human rights education ; ( c ) human rights educational access for marginalized groups ; and ( d ) treatment of human rights issues by the mass media ( including television , radio , newspapers and popular magazines ) .  
At its fiftieth session , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 182 of 22 December 1995 , entitled Human rights and mass exoduses , in which it , inter alia , acknowledged that mass exoduses of populations were caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation .  
United Nations treaty bodies , special rapporteurs , representatives and independent experts have regularly provided valuable information on specific human rights problems having the potential of generating mass exoduses or preventing their resolution , together with recommendations for corrective measures .  
As regards prevention , the CIS countries are encouraged to ratify and implement relevant international instruments , make use of the existing procedures and mechanisms established by international bodies and establish national institutions responsible for monitoring and promoting the protection of human rights .  
An effective human rights regime , secured by institutions that support the rule of law , including an independent judicial system accessible to all and an accountable public administration , is also of paramount importance for the creation of a stable society and thus conducive to consolidating peace and preventing the recurrence of mass exodus .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
In paragraphs 20 and 21 of resolution 1997 / 66 , the Commission requested the Special Representative " to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate " and to report on these matters to the upcoming sessions of the Assembly and Commission .  
Given the tremendous scale and severity of the violations of human rights and humanitarian law that were perpetrated during the traumatic days of the Rwandan civil war in 1994 - a time which saw the brutal carrying out of one of this century 's worst genocides - and the weak response of the international community at this critical time in Rwanda 's history , the Government is to be commended for its cooperation with the members of the international community active in human rights matters in Rwanda .  
They declared themselves in favour of a new and more democratic world order based on the strengthening of collective security and the development of cooperation in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres and in the defence of human rights .  
The 1996 special seminars organized by the Office of Legal Affairs and UNITAR covered the following topics : 13 ( a ) International protection of human rights ; ( b ) International humanitarian law ; ( c ) Refugee law ; ( d ) International law and sustainable development ; ( e ) International economic law ; ( f ) World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system ; ( g ) International environmental law ; and ( h ) Law of the sea .  
These UNESCO Chairs play an active role in upgrading the knowledge of basic values of human rights , democracy and peace at the university level and at the same time serve as focal points for promoting education for peace , tolerance and international understanding at all educational levels .  
Thus , while the Government of the Republic of Angola regrets once again the fact that , in spite of the numerous General Assembly resolutions , among others , not one positive measure has been taken to lift the embargo , it urges the international community to cooperate with the United Nations in order to put an end , as soon as possible , to that blockade , whose main victims are thousands of human beings who are forced to make extraordinary sacrifices and see their social and economic development hindered .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1997 / 57 in which it requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect , all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
Although hampered by financial and administrative constraints , the field operation has successfully accomplished a number of tasks , including compiling information on the human rights situation ; verifying information received , including through investigative missions ; alerting the Special Rapporteur to trends and developments so that she might take timely action ; and organizing the Special Rapporteurs missions .  
Prevention and preparedness strategies , based on scientific and technological applications as well as on social equity , and including the full involvement of civil society , must be put in place to protect national assets and property and especially to reduce human suffering , the loss of life , and the disruption of livelihoods .  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Strongly urges all Governments to guarantee the respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the right to life , and to take urgent measures to prevent the killing of children living and / or working on the streets and to combat torture and violence against them , and to ensure strict compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant human rights instruments , including the requirement that legal and juridical processes respect the rights of the child ;  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
Finally , all States of the region are invited to address , through various forms of cooperation , terrorism , international crime and illicit drug production and trafficking , as factors jeopardizing friendly relations between States , hindering the development of international cooperation , and , above all , resulting in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
UNDP will help to expand a current IDB , World Bank and ECLAC regional programme aimed at improving household surveys and the capacity of countries to measure living standards and poverty conditions , a key instrument for the design and monitoring of public policies in the context of sustainable human development .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip the Arab societies with greater capacity to reduce the lack of access to reliable sources of energy as a barrier to economic growth and human development , with a special focus on poor , remote areas and women , through the effective management of the supply and demand side of the issue .  
At the regional level , in support of subregional and national actions , the programme will explore innovative approaches to the interconnected issues of governance , gender and poverty and will advance the application of the human development index ( pioneered by the earlier phase of the regional programme ) to incorporate an understanding of the impact of the epidemic .  
In an indicative list , the Council identified macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters as areas where gender mainstreaming needs to be pursued systematically .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
It was realistic in that it focused on concrete partnerships and practical solutions , and would tap the human , technological and financial resources which had been beyond the reach of the United Nations , and which had become far greater than official development assistance .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Although an express prohibition of arbitrary displacement is contained in international humanitarian law ( Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols ) and in the law relating to indigenous peoples , in human rights law , by contrast , the prohibition is only implicit in various provisions , particularly in the rights to freedom of movement , choice of residence and housing , and freedom from arbitrary interference with ones home .  
The objectives of this project are to help to formulate sound human development policies through : ( a ) the preparation of national human development reports , combined with an annual regional human development report ; and ( b ) the development of improved statistics on human development indicators , including reports on social trends by countries , the latter in close cooperation with ECE . 13 .  Subregional workshops will bring together specialists responsible for national human development reports and from the national statistical offices .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
While significance of national and regional characteristics and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
In order to take effective legislative and political measures to ensure equality between women and men , Bulgaria had adopted a national plan of action in 1996 aimed at protecting the human rights of women , improving their economic and social status , eradicating female poverty , promoting the participation of women in decision-making , improving the health of women and eliminating all forms of violence against women . 
The special difficulties involved in investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in circumstances of internal armed conflict and the prevailing limitations in this respect in Rwanda should be explicitly recognized in the reports of the Field Operation .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
The preparation of a high-resolution digital mosaic of the ice sheet and exposed portions of the continent will help to better understand why changes in the ice sheet occur , providing more insight into the effects of human activity and global warming on the rapid retreat of large portions of the shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula .  
For instance , the Tribunal 's activities involve field investigative work which frequently is fraught with personal risks to the investigative teams and their confidential sources ; custody , care and local as well as international transport of detainees who must be treated as high security risks at all times while at the same time respecting their basic human rights as detainees in a prison facility ; likewise for the witnesses , whose cooperation is essential to the successful prosecution of cases before the Tribunal .  
The Team has directly raised awareness about Pacific island Constitutions , laws , human rights , gender and the application of United Nations Conventions among rural and urban women , youth groups , civil society activists , social welfare officers , police officers , religious seminarians , magistrates , justices , senior court judges and other providers of the justice system in the Cook Islands , Fiji , the Federated States of Micronesia , Kiribati , the Marshall Islands , Nauru , Niue , Samoa , the Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu and Vanuatu .  
The return and sustainability of investments in physical capital appeared to be higher when done together with those in human and social capital to counteract rapid technological change and inappropriate socio-economic organization at local level .  
The issue of human rights was of particular importance for Kuwait , because the entire population was suffering as a result of the delay by the Iraqi regime in freeing prisoners and detainees from Kuwait and elsewhere , as well as its uncooperative attitude at the meetings in Geneva of the Tripartite Commission and of its technical committee .  14 .  The human , social and psychological consequences of the Iraqi occupation continued to be felt .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Stresses its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries , and reaffirms that the satisfaction of basic human needs is an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and equal opportunities for participation in political , economic , cultural and social life ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Convinced of the necessity of protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and determined to take new steps forward , nationally and with the increased cooperation and solidarity of the international community , with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights ,  
Stressing the fact that realization of the full range of human rights requires effective policies and compliance at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Calls upon relevant United Nations organs and agencies - in the light of the principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - to make , within their respective mandates and fields of action , an assessment of , and to put forward pertinent conclusions on , the state of implementation and the impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of training , dissemination and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Strongly urges all Governments to guarantee the respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the right to life , and to take urgent measures to prevent the killing of children living and / or working on the streets and to combat torture and violence against them , and to ensure strict compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant human rights instruments , including the requirement that legal and juridical processes respect the rights of the child ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Recalling its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , in particular Commission resolution 1997 / 75 of 18 April 1997 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , [ 1 ] which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people ,  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Welcomes the efforts of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to contribute to the creation of an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , and broad-based programmes of human rights education , and strengthening of local non-governmental organizations through programmes of advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons , enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expressions , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
Further recalling that in order to promote development equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular the numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , such as refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
Activities in this field have included conducting and coordinating trial monitoring activities ; providing human rights expertise to the expert team for criminal justice reform ; supporting a project on a judicial training institute ; and conducting a project to provide suspects with lawyers familiar with international human rights law .  
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
Calls upon both the landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours to implement measures to strengthen further their cooperative and collaborative efforts , including bilateral cooperation , in dealing with transit issues , inter alia , by improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral and subregional agreements to govern transit transport operations , developing joint ventures in the area of transit transport and strengthening institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport , and , in this respect , notes that South-South cooperation also plays an important role in this field ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
Paragraph 22.2 should read : " The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with the human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
In its paragraph 5 , Part I , the Vienna Declaration and Programme of action recalled that All human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated and , in paragraph 98 , Part II , that to strengthen the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , additional approaches should be examined , such as a system of indicators to measure progress in the realization of the rights set forth in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
What is needed , with regard to the effective promotion and protection of those rights , is for the Organization and its Member States to take more decisive steps towards the inalienable right to development , understood not only as economic growth but also as eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of the basic material and spiritual needs of the human being in conditions of equal opportunity .  
In order to raise awareness of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Department carries on a multi _ media approach to ensure the effective coverage of this issue as well as worldwide distribution of relevant public information materials on human rights .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolution 1996 / 28 , decided to transmit the revised draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission , Mr . Theo van Boven to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration .  
If it is decided to broaden the scope of application of the basic principles and guidelines to include all violations , and all the more so if that alternative is rejected , it would seem essential for the document to explain what is meant by gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , which constitute crimes under international law .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .  
The Government of Sweden warmly welcomes the draft revised basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and wishes to express its deep appreciation of the dedicated work performed by the former Special Rapporteur , Mr . Theo van Boven .  
Hence , should the right to reparation be limited to gross violations , the correct wording under public international law would be : gross violations of human rights and grave breaches and other serious violations of international humanitarian law .  
In the view of the League of Arab States , far from being limited to a specific part of the world , the dangerous consequences of terrorism will spread throughout the entire world unless there is international coordination and cooperation to combat this phenomenon , which unquestionably constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights .  
Given that terrorism posed a stumbling block to worldwide social , economic and political development and was , moreover , a violation of human rights , concerted international efforts should be made to eliminate it .  
The Advisory Committee was not provided with adequate justification for the posts being requested in relation to the programme of work for the completion of all outstanding areas of the peace accords mentioned in paragraph 3 of the statement of the Secretary-General on programme budget implications ( i.e . , public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , protection of the wounded and disabled and legislative reform ) .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Paragraph 1 ( a ) of the note describes the qualities of the person to assume that position , which include high moral standing and personal integrity ; expertise , including in the field of human rights ; and the general knowledge and understanding of diverse cultures necessary for impartial , objective , non-selective and effective performance of the duties of the High Commissioner .  
Furthermore , on the subject of human rights , our countries have also gone through a difficult and often painful process in their transition to democracy and in the quest for fundamental human rights , a process that resulted in sad and tragic episodes but also taught valuable lessons that can and should be shared with other parts of the world .  
We , the United Nations Member States and observer States , have agreed to adopt the Agenda for Development , thus holding forth a global promissory note and universal hope for the millions of our people throughout the entire world who daily go without sufficient food and water , who battle diseases and natural disasters , who can not read or write , who lack shelter , who are jobless , whose entire lives are stunted and who are deprived of the simple pleasures of human existence because of poverty . 
It also reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development .  
The European Union accordingly supports unreservedly MINUGUA activities aimed at strengthening Guatemala \ x { e5b8 } institutions ; those activities focus most particularly on the legal system , public security , and the promotion of a multicultural , multilingual and multiethnic State , on education and promotion regarding the peace agreements and their dissemination , and on the creation of a national climate conducive to respect for human rights .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 11 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably ' with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out ' .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue , within existing resources , to cooperate with the appropriate regional organizations and to provide policy advice and technical assistance , especially in capacity-building , to countries with economies in transition , tailored to each country 's respective economic and social needs in the field of housing and human settlements , and paying special attention , inter alia , to :  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
The Centre established a comprehensive data base on non-governmental organizations and other partners active in human settlements and is expanding its programme with those partners which had participated actively in the Habitat II preparatory process and had organized their own forums and presented their declarations and commitments to Committee II of the Conference . 11 .  At the present time , the main operational activity of the Centre in relation to the Global Strategy for Shelter , is the application of the urban and housing indicators .  
This will be possible only if the Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic tasks the maintenance of international peace and security and comprehensive economic and social development , particularly in developing countries and to ensure broad respect for the promotion and protection of individual and collective human rights . 
Respect for human rights is achieved not only through the functioning of instruments to monitor compliance with international treaties but also through political , social and economic measures that allow human rights to become an integral part of social development and a part of the everyday life of each individual .  
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
We have taken substantial strides towards the ideal of peace and security ; strengthened and broadened the observance of human rights ; enhanced and developed international law and widened the scope of international penal law , in particular ; and laid the foundations for greater responsibility by States in the advancement of social progress .  
On the contrary , they have become even more marginalized in the global economy for the very simple reason that they lack the physical , financial and human resources as well as the institutional infrastructure necessary for effective competition and integration in the international markets .  
While remaining faithful to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter the maintenance of international peace and security , cooperation for economic , social and cultural development , defence of human rights , and humanitarian assistance the United Nations should also promote and pursue a reform process which takes into account the many changes that have taken place in a complex international scene .  
But I feel that it is appropriate to repeat the principal characteristic of our development model , which is a harmonious and rational complementary relationship between economic and social policies , which for the first time in many years is enabling us to carry out a realistic strategy for sustainable human development .  
In seeking to enhance its participation in such regional and international institutions , the United Arab Emirates , thanks to the wise guidance of its Head of State , His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan , has achieved a qualitative and quantitative leap in the developmental , economic , social , environmental and human fields in the past two decades .  
The Ecuadorian State is committed to following this line of conduct and to promoting and protecting all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , including the right to development .  
We must be prepared to face other kinds of war : social war against poverty ; judicial war against organized crime ; political war against interventionism in our sovereign economies ; and moral war against the violation of human rights . 
Accordingly , he continuously advocated in his lifetime the creation of a new global human order premised on sustainable economic development , equity and social and ecological justice , and based on the creation of a separate global development fund for assistance to both the North and the South .  
By building peace , reducing unsustainable military expenditures , promoting equitable and sustainable development and encouraging stable , democratic societies which respect human rights , we not only limit human suffering , but we also address the root causes of conflict itself .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
Our commitment to the setting up of such a court stems from the fact that this court would be a landmark development in the creation of a balanced and effective system aimed at ensuring that international crimes , especially mass violations of basic fundamental human rights , do not remain unpunished .  
Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
The Secretary-General 's reform initiative is the most comprehensive attempt to date at fashioning the United Nations of tomorrow into an instrument capable of serving the common interests of all peoples , guided by the enduring tenets of peace , human rights , the rule of law and social progress , enshrined in the Charter more than half a century ago .  
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the few countries that from time immemorial , owing to its geostrategic placement and its vast human and natural resources , has borne the burden of a sombre history of suffering and outrageous violations of human rights and the rights of peoples .  
In 1885 , when Africa was being colonized , my country was set up as a State that was the personal property of the King of the Belgians ; it endured violence and blatant violations of human rights connected inter alia with the exploitation of red rubber and other kinds of forced labour . 
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
Every new charge made by Cuba is supported by more than $ 60-billion in losses and that is not a full assessment by an economy distorted by the war conditions imposed on us , and by the incalculable human , physical and psychological damage we have sustained .  
All of this madness has revived official and covert operations , mercenaries , spies and assassins , as ready now as in the worst days of the cold war to plot and unleash terror against human beings and even employ aggressive biological agents against our economy .  
And we all have an obligation to work towards maintaining international peace and security ; achieving international cooperation in solving economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems ; and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms .  
On the contrary , it means adjusting these lofty aims to the new realities of a multifaceted world and also making the Organization no matter how different its separate parts are the mainstream of human development , where the economic well-being of people brings to an end age-old ills such as starvation and epidemic diseases , as well as huge environmental threats , and which helps to achieve multilateral understanding between those participating in this development .  
While I would certainly acknowledge that some of the international community 's concern has been justified , I would like very much to say that the Republic of Belarus is a sovereign State that develops its own policy with due regard for the opportunities economic , social , moral and psychological of its citizens , within the limits of international patterns of behaviour and with respect for human rights and personal freedoms . 
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
We note that , unfortunately , our neighbour , Turkey , is indulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep historical , religious and human relations between Iraq and Turkey . Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate our sovereignty , interfere in our internal affairs and invade our territory , on the basis of flimsy pretexts .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
This is a space devoid of the most basic human values ; a space in which children are slaughtered , raped and maimed ; a space in which children are exploited as soldiers ; a space in which children are starved and exposed to extreme brutality .  
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .  
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing interest in establishing or strengthening existing national human rights institutions , as a constructive way to take positive action at the national level , bearing in mind national circumstances , to promote respect for human rights .  Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
A credible and independent human rights commission , along with a genuinely independent national electoral commission , could make an important contribution to protecting stability and promoting the observance of human rights in Cambodia in the lead-up to what we strongly hope will be free , fair and credible elections in May next year .  
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
At the internal level , the relation between the Government and its citizens is based , as I said before , on constitutional legitimacy ; on equality among all citizens , whether male or female ; on equality in rights and obligations of men and women alike ; on the freedom of individuals and groups ; on the freedom of association to parties , trade unions and civilian community organizations ; on freedom of the press ; and on the protection of human rights .  
Yet while today it is the Congolese people who are hostages , perhaps tomorrow it will be another people 's turn to be taken hostage by a political class that is driven by selfish ambitions , unprepared to accept the rules of democracy and uninterested in seeking and maintaining peace .  Every day and at an increasing human cost , the excessive demands of some and the lack of tolerance of others defer to a later date the establishment of conditions for a negotiated peace .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
While our strong commitment to social policy has paid rich dividends , as illustrated by the successive high rankings of Barbados in the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) human development index , emerging problems largely associated with poverty , particularly among youth , are of critical concern .  
It is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly the contradictory positions of some of our members , who purport to be champions and defenders of human rights issues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations that directly deny genuine democratic representation and the rights of people to govern themselves in a manner consistent with their political aspirations . 
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
Through the three-pronged approach adopted by the Summit , States committed themselves to pursuing the objective of eradicating poverty in the world , promoting full employment as a fundamental public-policy priority and promoting social integration by fostering stable , safe and just societies on the basis of respect for human rights , non-discrimination and the closest possible involvement of all in decisions affecting their well-being .  
Within this overall conceptual construct , the Summit resolved to create a framework for policy and action at the national , regional and international levels geared to the promotion of social progress , justice and the betterment of the human condition .  
However , national , regional and international efforts have not yet succeeded in transforming the social situation of today \ x { e5b8 } world , which is marked by major disparities in income and by the extreme poverty that affects the lives of billions of human beings .  
Thailand therefore agrees with the importance of the people-centred approach to development put forward by the Copenhagen Summit , which emphasizes that development can not be sustained in the long run if it is based only on purely physical economic growth , without due consideration of human and other social and environmental dimensions .  
The Action Strategy begins with measures representing a set of possible early priority interventions , including land title reform ; a new agricultural development initiative and special agricultural economic zones ; promotion of new manufacturing investment through relocation of labour-intensive industries to create industrial estates in the region ; introduction of modern and appropriate technologies ; marketing systems ; and human resource development , including improved skills . 
It is the aim of the Jamaican Government to develop adequate employment opportunities , matched by improvements in the skills and literacy of our human resources , recognizing that an effectively trained , adaptable and flexible work force is critical if we are to meet the demands of the economy .  
It focuses on strengthening the institutional capacities of the Government at both central and local levels , policy management and poverty monitoring , promoting human resources development through providing better access to health and education opportunities , alleviating rural poverty , good governance and developing and strengthening the basic social safety net .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation \ x { e5b8 } sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help generate renewed political will at the national , regional and international levels to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
Targeting policies at the most vulnerable groups of society children , women , the elderly , the disadvantaged , the poor , the disabled is , moreover , a prerequisite for the successful realization of social justice , equity and respect for human dignity .  
Likewise , in keeping with a modern , integrated concept , the Romanian Government has approached social issues in close relation with economic growth and the complex factors involved in sustainable human development .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
The mission , in its broadest sense , must coordinate and implement humanitarian relief , civil affairs , electoral assistance , police and judicial reorganization , human rights and economic and social reconstruction actions that must be sustained long after the guns have been silenced .  
The purpose was to begin to create a new human being with stronger moral values and principles , a human being who is more tolerant of differences , more productive economically , with ideals , loyalty and virtue in political matters and embracing social unity ; in sum , to try to alter elements that are deeply rooted in a population , as well as those that are emerging .  
We hope that the international community of States , non-governmental organizations , civil society , religious groups and local bodies will , together , work vigorously to promote education and awareness so that peace and tolerance may prevail throughout the world , together with a diversity of opinions and ideas and respect for basic human rights , including the right to physical and moral integrity .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .  
We are witnessing on a daily basis the resurgence of intolerance , violence and non-respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; incitements to hatred are spreading to many corners of the planet ; many peoples are still oppressed and are unacquainted with the great benefit of freedom ; and international disputes which must be resolved exclusively by peaceful means , in accordance with the San Francisco Charter are continuing , imperilling peace and security .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
The collective campaign of the world community to define , promote and protect human rights across the globe represents a great achievement of humanity at large and needs to be cherished by all ; however , the imperative of a balanced approach to all aspects of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , should not be theoretically underestimated or practically neglected .  
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
The Rwanda Tribunal is faced with the very difficult task of adjudicating persons responsible for the most egregious crimes imaginable by the human mind : the crime of genocide , crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
Adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights only three years after the establishment of the United Nations reflected a common understanding that fundamental freedoms and respect for human dignity provide the most solid foundation for peace , democracy , development and fruitful international cooperation in every field of human activity .  
The reform proposed by the Secretary-General is aimed at strengthening the leadership role of the Secretary-General , improving coordination among the various bodies active in each field , such as peace and security , economic and social affairs , development , human rights and humanitarian affairs , and ensuring greater cooperation among the different departments and programmes , in order to achieve a fully integrated and interactive United Nations .  
Central America has made great progress in demilitarization and in the strengthening of civil society , holding free , transparent and pluralist elections ; integrating former combatants into national political processes ; strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law ; and implementing a development programme whose central focus is the human being .  
The denial of basic human rights , the confiscation of one 's rightful property and ancestral home , the denial of free movement , the obstruction of necessary economic activity , the importation of thousands of foreigners to be settled in confiscated land in occupied territory , the systematic and deliberate splitting of the West Bank through streams of bypass highways and indiscriminately placed settlements all these , in our view , amount to a clear record of violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli authorities .  
During these last five years our initial predictions concerning sustainable development have been justified insofar as this process has proved to be a very complex global endeavour embodying all aspects of human life and requiring awareness and active participation at all levels .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
Empirical evidence suggests that the countries that have been successful in sustaining capital inflows and long-term growth are those that have systematically upgraded their human capital and infrastructure and have promoted the continuous diversification or deepening of their domestic productive base .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .  
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action3 reaffirmed basic principles governing international human rights activities , set out specific goals on a wide number of areas and identified various methods to achieve them .  
At its fiftieth session , the Commission adopted resolution 1994 / 45 , entitled The question of integrating the rights of women into the human rights mechanism of the United Nations and the elimination of violence against women , in which inter alia , it called for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status of women and the human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms .  
In its resolution 1996 / 51 , the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ third session an update of the report of the Secretary-General on human rights and mass exoduses ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 42 ) , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to that resolution , as well as all relevant information on the human rights situations creating or affecting refugees and displaced persons .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled " Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights " , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
The Government considered that the use of force , foreign occupation or domination , and unilateral economic coercion or international sanctions to resolve conflicts , halt violations of human rights and promote democracy , were factors in creating refugees and mass exoduses .  
The Note outlined several elements indispensable in protection-based comprehensive approaches to avoiding mass displacement , such as upholding the international rule of law , including relevant human rights and refugee law principles , which should be seen as positive and enabling components of any comprehensive approach .  
The United Nations Department for Public Information ( DPI ) highlighted the important role of public information in raising awareness of the question of human rights and mass exodus , highlighting activities such as the production of print material , films , radio and television programmes and radio documentaries , as well as collaborating with NGOs and coordinating inter-agency promotional activities .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
As regards future prospects , the Government of Russia recalled the importance of combined efforts of concerned States and international organizations and called for steps to raise standards in human rights and minorities protection , to consolidate civil society and national harmony and promote tolerance and mutual respect among all strata of the population - ultimately for the good of democracy , the supremacy of law , and stability .  
UNHCR also noted the continuing cooperation and information _ sharing with the relevant mechanism of the Commission , specifically noting the logistical support and information-sharing and collaboration with United Nations human rights field missions , which it considered to be an important means of addressing the root causes issues and an integral part of comprehensive solutions .  
In addition to taking preventive action , the High Commissioner is seeking to take action regarding durable solutions , such as attempting to create an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , broad-based programmes of human rights education , as well as the strengthening of local non-governmental organizations .  
When barriers are erected against immigrants , or deep cuts are made in welfare budgets , or programmes intended to encourage the social integration of minorities are dismantled , all with complete sang _ froid and disdain for the human condition , and when the most basic rights to education and health denied to the children of immigrants , as Act No . 187 of the State of California in the United States would do , these practices are becoming institutionalized .  
The Government of Mexico , given the incidents in Riverside County , California , in March and April 1996 when Mexican nationals were beaten and some lost their lives , has expressed its indignation to its United States counterpart and forcefully condemned violations of its nationals ' human rights , stating that the clear abuse of authority displayed in those incidents confirms the urgent need for determined action to stamp out discriminatory attitudes which spill over into acts of institutional violence .  
After reviewing the testimony and documentation we are convinced that the evidence supports a conclusion that police violence and corruption on the local , state and federal levels , particularly within communities of colour and poor communities , are at the foundation of a gross and consistent pattern of human rights violations in the United States .  
A number of Governments have taken action to provide basic health services for youth ; promote good sanitation and hygiene practices among youth ; develop health education and accessible , available and affordable primary health care services ( including services related to sexual and reproductive health and relevant education in those fields , such as information about sexually transmitted diseases , such as human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) ) ; eliminate sexual abuse of young people ; and combat malnutrition among young people .  
While rapid economic growth based largely on investment in human resources has facilitated a reduction of the proportion of the poor in some parts of the ESCAP region , inadequate investment in human resources has sustained and in some cases actually increased the concentration of the poor in other parts of the region . 
The aims and objectives of the national youth policy of Indonesia are : ( a ) to help foster Indonesia awareness , identity , solidarity and prosperity among youth ; ( b ) to promote policies and programmes relating to youth as an integral part of social and cultural values among the Asian and Pacific nations ; and ( c ) to realize the potential of youth as human resources in regional development .  
Generally , small island developing States face inordinate operational difficulties because of inadequate technically qualified human resources , poor infrastructure and installation , and deficient planning .  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
This is due to the number and complexity of the polluting materials being discharged into receiving waters , inadequate knowledge about the pathways and ultimate sinks of many pollutants , the need for expensive and sophisticated analytical procedures for some pollutants , and insufficient knowledge of the human and environmental impacts of many pollutants , particularly synthetic organic materials .  
The challenge today remains the same : to meet an enormous projected global demand for resources , especially energy , through the use of new products , technologies and consumption patterns which will provide rising standards of living for all while minimizing economic costs and risks to human health and the environment .  
Evidence is strong that most of the increase is attributable to human activity , in particular , to fossil fuel combustion . 8 Continuation of these emission trends poses serious , though uncertain , risks of global and regional climate change , leading to unpredictable rises in sea level , inundation of low-lying coastal areas , migration of ecosystems and disruption of agriculture .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of HCHR / CHR , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , HCHR / CHR has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
The series fills a real gap in the human rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 163 of 21 December 1993 in which it proclaimed the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People ( 1995-2004 ) , stated that the Decade 's main objective was to strengthen international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights , the environment , development , education and health .  
An effective response requires the implementation of all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , and fundamental freedoms of all people , in accordance with existing international human rights standards ;  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .  
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .  
Constraints include : ( a ) scarcity of human and financial resources ; ( b ) low institutional capacity ; ( c ) lack of coherent realistic policies in some countries , and on occasions lack of political will ; and ( d ) inadequate awareness and understanding of the potential benefits and risks of the technology , as well as of the requirements for its environmentally sound management .  
Paragraph 238 explains that , in the provision of assistance , facilitating mechanisms are to be supported for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of human settlements progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
It is important to note that the Habitat II Conference reconfirmed the legal status of the human right to adequate housing as set forth in the relevant international instruments and stressed that this right should be progressively , but fully , realized .  
We reaffirm that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social - are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
In its resolution 1996 / 64 of 23 April 1996 entitled " Regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Asian and Pacific region " , the Commission on Human Rights reaffirmed that regional arrangements played a fundamental role in promoting and protecting human rights and that they should reinforce universal human rights standards , as contained in international human rights instruments .  
The Amman Workshop reaffirms that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu .  
The Workshop calls upon States to refrain from any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in international human rights instruments , in particular the rights of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their health and well _ being , including food and medical care , housing and the necessary social services .  
The Workshop strongly recommends that a regional technical cooperation programme be designed and implemented as a matter of urgent priority in partnership with the Centre for Human Rights of the United Nations , under its technical cooperation programme , with a view to facilitating the sharing of experience , expertise and best practices within the region to further enhance national and regional human rights capacities .  
Actions taken in furtherance of the present Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States , as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
A report by three VSV human rights workers arbitrarily imprisoned in October in a SARM cachot in Kinshasa ( see para . 104 ) is revealing as to the treatment of the inmates there : inhuman and cruel conditions ; constant ill _ treatment , to the point of slavery ; overcrowded cells ( up to 19 inmates ) ; lack of beds ; access to the toilets depending on the warders ' mood ; mental , though not systematically physical torture . 
While maintaining her call for continued economic assistance to the countries in her mandate for their reconstruction , the Special Rapporteur believes that local authorities must be kept aware that such assistance ( to be distinguished from emergency humanitarian aid ) depends expressly on their demonstrated respect for the principles of international human rights .  
The report will highlight important findings announced at the London meeting , in particular , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominantly cereal diets of most developing countries .  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
The ongoing programmes are essential and deeply appreciated .  The conduct of the forthcoming elections and other challenges outlined in this report will make the coming couple of years crucial in the efforts to build a society in Cambodia that respects all the human rights of all the people .  
Such issues included : human adaptation to alpine conditions , the general pathology and the curative properties of the mountain climate , distinctive features of the social environment and mentality of mountain peoples , and economic development and demographic stability in mountain regions .  
The international community 's attention to this global problem , and the coordination and adoption of an appropriate programme of collective preventive measures , would do much to neutralize or reduce the negative impact of mountain - climate cataclysms on human lives , and would promote the sustainable economic development of mountainous countries and mountain peoples .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
All Sudanese citizens living in areas controlled by the Government of the Sudan are potential victims of human rights violations and abuses , regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic origin or social status , once they are considered to be opponents of the Government of the Sudan , or even suspected of being in disagreement with its political agenda .  
At the very minimum , the mandate requires the services of two regular human rights officers , adequate administrative support , and a commensurate level of secretarial expertise .  
The continued existence of the problem of internal displacement combined with the ongoing need to search for solutions require that the capacity of the Representatives mandate and of the United Nations human rights machinery in general be strengthened in order to meet these challenges in a comprehensive and effective manner .  
If applicable , assists the Director in preparing methods and procedures for verification of human rights during internal armed confrontation , commitment to strengthening the system for the protection of human rights , commitment relating to security forces and the bearing of arms , military conscription and voluntary nature and behaviour of paramilitary forces ; assists also in following up the verification and evaluating the findings of regional offices . 
In its resolution , the Commission urged the international community to give the necessary support to developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments governing the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all .  
The Commission requested the Secretary-General to establish in the Centre for Human Rights a focal unit with the specific task of following up on the findings of the Special Rapporteur and other issues related to the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity and be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Declaration , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its decision 1996 / 112 of 23 April 1996 , decided to retain on its agenda item 10 ( a ) entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , it being understood that action required by previous resolutions of the Commission on that subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary-General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
As it relates to freedom of expression , the Kurdish question consists of a positive element _ cultural identity as an essential part of the universal human dignity protected by human rights _ and a negative element _ the political usurpation of this identity by those who seek to gain and retain power by all means , including terrorism .  
An express and clear incitement to hatred or to the use of violence that poses a clear and imminent danger to the legitimate interests of the State and all of its citizens calls for the State to take strong action to protect all human rights as well as national security and public order , bearing in mind the necessity and proportionality of those measures in relation to the threat posed .  
The Government faces a very difficult task and heavy responsibility in its obligation to protect all citizens of the Turkish Republic from the scourge of terrorism while simultaneously protecting all human rights of all the people of Turkey . 55 .  Secondly , while the press and other media are vivid , the Special Rapporteur finds that , at times , the press is not inspired by a vision of itself as a professional force that serves to inform all members of the public .  
The joint scientific research programme conducted during the 21st expedition included experiments relating to the vital functions of the human organism , microgravity , basic biological research , advanced technologies and Earth sciences .  
These experiments are aimed at laying the practical foundations for enabling human beings to spend prolonged periods of time under conditions of space flight ( studies on radiation safety , strain on the human support and locomotive system , determination of the mechanisms involved in vestibular disorders and changes in the cardiovascular system , and development of methods for their prevention or treatment ) .  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Requests the International Civil Service Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the United Nations common system , including consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session . 
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
Attention was drawn to the frequent emphasis placed by international forums on the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights , be they civil , political , economic , social or cultural .  
The adoption of a protocol in respect of an instrument that contained civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural human rights , would constitute an important step towards the actual realization of that principle .  
Past experience , together with results from expert group meetings and the interactive dialogues to be held during the Commission in 1997 , may serve as a basis for identifying measures which could help to accelerate progress in achieving equality between men and women in the critical areas of concern identified at Beijing as crucial for eliminating discrimination against women and enabling women around the world to fully enjoy their human rights .  
The objective will be to develop an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the implementation , coordination and promotion of the right to development in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , aimed at facilitating action to be taken by relevant bodies of the United Nations system , including human rights treaty bodies , and international development and financial institutions and non _ governmental organizations . 
He is referring to the interrelationship between three problems : growing unemployment , which affects the poorest sectors and might lead to dangerous marginalization ; urban crime , which has very high rates and is prejudicial to substantive human rights such as the right to life and the right to physical integrity ; and security , which involves serious defects and alarming contrasts .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
The degree of enjoyment of both civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights has altered significantly among the various segments of the Afghan population ; gender and ethnic origin have become important determining factors regarding the degree of enjoyment of human rights in certain parts of the country .  
In East Timor , a wide range of human rights violations continued to take place during the last year , compounded by increasing incidents of political , religious and ethnic violence .  
The present report limits itself to a selection of human activities that are : ( a ) not gravely hazardous to the environment if carried out over a limited period of time but are cumulative and hazardous if undertaken on a continued basis ; ( b ) undertaken occasionally and / or involve a potential risk of major contamination within a given geographical area and time-frame .  4 .  The report , however , does not provide a comprehensive analysis of environmental impacts of activities that are gravely hazardous to the environment .  
Although the Commission was not yet fully functional at the time of the mission of the Special Rapporteur , standing committees had been established on relations with non _ governmental and community _ based organizations , and international and parliamentary liaison , on legal and constitutional matters , and on policy and planning matters , including those relating to women 's human rights .  
Working together , the human rights community will make the United Nations human rights programme a programme of all people everywhere : strong , to prevent human rights violations ; reliable , to protect and defend victims ; interactive , to be shaped by all the actors concerned ; flexible , to react to evolving needs ; compelling , to build a worldwide Partnership for Human Rights .  
The criteria for sustainable development should include better protection of all human rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as protection of the most vulnerable and impoverished .  
The holistic approach to human rights requires , however , that particular attention be paid to the areas of human rights which are currently in a weaker position : from a global perspective , economic , social and cultural rights require further attention in determining their contents and strengthening the means and methods of their realization . 
Whether expressed in terms of State responsibility or of international human rights , development requires competent governmental leadership , coherent national policy , and strong popular commitment .  
The experience of countries which have chosen the challenging road to sustainable development , democracy and human rights , and which are already beginning to enjoy the fruits of this decision in the form of interrelated economic progress , political consolidation and social stability , proves that human rights are not only noble ideas .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
The international community must act with energy to eradicate gross violations of human rights and humanitarian crises , which are major human tragedies and result in millions of refugees and internally displaced persons , starving children and adults , lack of medical care , and hopeless futures for thousands lost and sometimes forgotten in even the most developed countries .  
On the basis of a comprehensive review of the activities of the Programme , the High Commissioner has developed the following policy orientation : the Programme focuses on countries in transition to democracy and less developed countries ; priority consideration is given to programmes addressing mandates emanating from the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action and from resolutions of United Nations organs , such as strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights , the promotion of economic , social and cultural rights , developing national plans of action , and building national institutions .  
Most representatives agreed with the Commission 's proposed approach to separate consideration of the question of the nationality of natural persons from that of the nationality of legal persons and to give priority to the former , which , it was argued , involved human rights , while the latter raised problems of an economic order .  
It was observed that the Declaration of the Venice Commission contained detailed provisions on the right of option and also included a new rule which , however , was in conformity with international standards of human rights , providing that the exercise of the right of option must have no prejudicial consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their right to residence in the successor State and their movable or immovable property located therein .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Other important factors determining possible programmes of technical cooperation that HC / CHR provides to Member States at their request are : specific recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies ; recommendations by the Commission on Human Rights and its mechanisms , including the representatives of the Secretary-General , the special rapporteurs on thematic or country situations and the various working groups ; the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation ; and the views expressed by national human rights institutions and national and international NGOs .  
The assessment team meets with interested parties , both governmental and non-governmental , in close cooperation with the United Nations Resident Coordinator , United Nations agencies and programmes , as well as local donors , and compiles detailed information on current policies , legislation , and human and financial capacities in key areas .  
In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .  
Given the gravity of the concerns highlighted , the mandate remains a most sensitive and difficult one since it relates to a State Member of the United Nations where governmental authority is absent and a State administration non _ existent , with the adverse impact this implies on the observance and protection of basic human rights and freedoms .  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Replace the first sentence with the following : At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to a multidimensional process , with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition . 
Encourages further technical , educational and economic cooperation among States , in coordination with the United Nations Children 's Fund , other relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , towards the development of human resources by nurturing the talents and potentials of children with disabilities , the development and dissemination of appropriate technologies and know-how , and the development of common standards for the national evaluation of childhood disability , with due regard for the situation of poor or developing countries ;  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
The country does not have the technical , physical or human resources to manufacture weapons of mass destruction , since its principal concern is to promote its economic development plan and to mitigate the adverse impact that the coercive measures imposed on our people have had on all aspects of life .  
A thorough assessment by the IPTF Commissioner has now determined that in order to carry out , in a satisfactory manner , the additional and existing tasks relating to human rights investigation , monitoring of the local police , strengthening of police training , police restructuring and the development of guidelines for democratic principles , IPTF will have to move from a police force with primarily generalist functions to one with a substantial number of police experts in specialized fields .  
Sharp reductions in the level of assistance for social welfare , health care and education ; insufficient energy supplies for hospitals , schools and residences ; and reduced real income for most families have hindered the ability of Tajikistan 's population to meet its most basic human needs .  
Pointing to the danger that the High-level Working Group could take decisions which were actually contrary to those adopted by the General Assembly , she proposed that all administrative and budgetary questions currently addressed by the High-level Working Group , including the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations and human resources management , should be considered by the Fifth Committee during the resumed fifty-first session .  
External assistance for the building of requisite infrastructure and national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly at the primary and secondary levels , including lifelong education , accessible to all , that augments both human capacity and well-being . 
Secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity and human resources , and adequate access to technology may promote the implementation of international legal instruments .  
The High Commissioner considers that the HRFOR mandate remains valid , namely , to carry out investigations into violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including possible acts of genocide ; to monitor the ongoing human rights situation , and through its presence help redress existing problems and prevent possible human rights violations from occurring ; to cooperate with other international agencies to re-establish confidence and thus facilitate the rebuilding of civil society ; and to implement programmes of technical cooperation in the field of human rights , particularly in the area of the administration of justice .  
The active involvement of women at national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health , in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
The representative of the United Kingdom found the original proposal of the representative of South Africa for a new article W acceptable to his delegation , because it maintained the status quo ( i.e . funding of human rights defenders being subject to national legislation consistent with applicable international law ) .  
Stressing that all members of the international community shall fulfil , jointly and separately , their solemn obligation to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of any kind including distinctions based on race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ,  
Each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect , promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms , inter alia by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social , economic , political as well as other fields and the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction , individually and in association with others , are able to enjoy all these rights and freedoms in practice .  
This includes , inter alia , the right , individually and in association with others , to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs , criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work which may hinder or impede the promotion , protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In this connection , everyone is entitled , individually and in association with others , to be effectively protected under national law in reacting against or opposing , through peaceful means , activities and acts attributable to States which result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Stressing that all members of the international community shall fulfil , jointly and separately , their solemn obligation to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of any kind such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status , and stressing the paramount importance of achieving international cooperation to fulfil this obligation , according to the United Nations Charter ,  
Everyone has the right [ is entitled ] , individually and in association with others , to solicit , receive and utilize voluntary financial or other contributions , for the purpose of promoting and protecting , through peaceful means , [ universally recognized ] human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The delegation of Colombia considered that the reference in article 6 , paragraph 4 , to ' the representation of different forms of civilization ' was not only unnecessary but constituted a harmful precedent in the universal and holistic conception of human rights , if it was borne in mind that , under the pretext of defending particular forms of civilization , human rights were in many cases flagrantly and continuously violated .  
Recalling the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annexed to General Assembly resolution 49 / 60 of 9 December 1994 , in which the Assembly declared that acts , methods and practices of terrorism constituted a grave violation of the purpose and principles of the United Nations , and might pose a threat to international peace and security , jeopardize friendly relations among States , hinder international cooperation and aim at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic bodies of society ,  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Decides to continue consideration of the question of the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights at its fifty _ fourth session under the agenda item entitled : Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;  
In other words , the principle of holding States accountable for non-compliance with their treaty obligations by means of an objective and constructive dialogue , on the basis of comprehensive information and inputs from all interested parties , has been vindicated in practice and has the potential to be an important and effective means by which to promote respect for human rights .  
It has been suggested in a number of places in this report that the provision of advisory services , or technical cooperation in the field of human rights , has a vital role to play in relation to those States which do not have the administrative capacity , technical expertise or financial resources required to prepare the reports they are legally obligated to provide under the relevant treaties .  
One of 20 substantive themes identified for the advisory services programme is treaty reporting and international obligations ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 90 , para . 23 ) , but the independent expert has not been able to identify from the available documentation any case in which assistance has been provided specifically for either the undertaking of a survey of the necessary measures to be taken prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or the preparation of a report to a treaty body .  
Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Emphasizing the priority that attaches to implementing specific measures to establish mechanisms that will facilitate the attainment of the practical objectives of building a democratic State ruled by law , based on political pluralism , the market economy , supremacy of the law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;  
Invites Governments to accord standard minimum humanitarian treatment to trafficked persons , consistent with human rights standards and , with the support of the United Nations , to formulate manuals for the training of personnel who receive and / or hold in temporary custody victims of gender _ based violence , including trafficking , with a view to sensitizing them to the special needs of victims ;  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Mindful that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights ,  
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient atttention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Reaffirms that the provision of advisory services and technical cooperation may be seen as a complement to the monitoring activities of the human rights programme from which no Government is exempt , and notes in this regard that , in order to produce lasting results , monitoring and preventive activities may need to be accompanied by promotional activities through advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirms that advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights require close cooperation and coordination between United Nations bodies and specialized agencies active in this field so as to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their respective programmes and avoid unnecessary duplication , and requests the High Commissioner to explore yet further possibilities for cooperation with specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as non _ governmental organizations ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Takes into account the Bangkok Declaration wherein it is recognized that while human rights are universal in nature , they must be considered in the context of a dynamic and evolving process of international norm _ setting , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Concerned that implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the Beijing Platform for Action remains far from the objectives set forth in the two documents and , therefore , calls once again for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status and human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms ;  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The Government of Croatia will look to cooperate with the international community in finding a proper way to harmonize the complex matrix of sometime conflicting interests of the two groups , while focusing its efforts on protecting civil liberties , human and minority rights , as well as maintaining internal security and regional peace and stability .  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved .  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Apart from international humanitarian law , Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , whose wording is repeated in the preamble to the draft optional protocol , stipulates : For the purposes of the present Convention , a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier .  
The international community will in future have to supply technological , economic and financial assistance to support political stability and balanced development , democratic institution-building and respect for human rights .  
Reaffirming its objectives as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
In paragraph 17 of his statement , the Secretary-General proposes to head the five verification areas ( human rights ; indigenous affairs ; social , economic and agrarian aspects ; strengthening of civilian power ; and resettlement and integration ) at the D-1 level instead of the current P-5 level .  
Noting that El Ni �� has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
Calls upon both the landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , including bilateral cooperation , to implement measures to strengthen further their cooperative and collaborative efforts in dealing with transit issues , inter alia , by improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral and subregional agreements to govern transit transport operations , developing joint ventures in the area of transit transport , and strengthening institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport , and , in this respect , notes that South-South cooperation also plays an important role in this field ;  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
Cuba 's bilateral relationship with Canada had enabled the Cuban delegation to communicate to that countrys representatives the point of view of vast sectors of civil society in Cuba regarding the exercise of human rights by the indigenous population of Canada , particularly their economic , social and cultural rights , in respect of which much progress needed to be made .  
The underlying reason for submitting the draft resolution was the fact that the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in an increasing number of developing countries had reached alarming proportions and had had adverse economic , social and cultural effects .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief detailed egregious violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief and demonstrated the degree to which that most fundamental human right continued to be breached .  
The solution to the problem of terrorism lay in addressing its root causes , as reaffirmed in any number of General Assembly resolutions , such as 40 / 61 and 46 / 51 , which urged States to pay special attention to situations involving flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and those involving alien domination and foreign occupation , that might give rise to international terrorism .  
The members of the Subcommittee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .  
Loss of experienced personnel and skilled labour , declines in productivity , the need for increased resources to hire and retrain replacements , increased absenteeism and labour turnover , increased health-care costs , coupled with the human and social costs endured by the individuals and communities affected by the pandemic are imposing heavy burdens , particularly on developing countries with limited resources .  
Convinced that small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of global climate change and sea level rise , and that tropical storms , the El Ni �� phenomenon and drought have resulted in the inundation of some islands and have caused serious loss of resources in their exclusive economic zones , economic infrastructure , human settlements and culture ,  
Stresses also in this context the need for various measures by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , especially the least developed countries , for their full integration into the world economy ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote [ sustained economic growth and sustainable development ] ,  
The major tasks of UNTAES were to assist in the demilitarization of the region ; to facilitate , together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the voluntary and safe return of refugees and displaced persons ; to reintegrate civil administration and public services ; to establish a temporary police force ; to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ; to organize elections ; to monitor respect for the highest standards of human rights ; and to promote an atmosphere of confidence among all local residents .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all Member States and seek their views and information on the implications and negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their populations , and to submit accordingly a report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session ; 8 .  Decides to examine this question , on a priority basis , at its fifty-third session under the sub-item entitled " Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " .  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
The delegation of Cyprus had given an accurate and alarming picture of the situation prevailing in the Turkish occupied area of northern Cyprus , where the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Greek Cypriot population were being systematically violated , as they had been throughout the 23-year presence of the Turkish armed forces on the island .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in support of national efforts in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Reaffirms that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty , to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty , and to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
The Ministry of the Interior had established a department whose responsibilities included the programme of reparation for acts committed between 1976 and 1983 , while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instituted a department with responsibility for shaping foreign policy in the area of human rights and the advancement of women and for coordinating with international bodies in that field . 
Mr . Al-Humaimidi ( Iraq ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the comments made by the United States representative following the introduction of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq had been motivated by that countrys desire to prevent the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq , despite Iraqs full compliance with the relevant Security Council resolution and contrary to the views of most members of the international community . 
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Terrorism had been clearly and definitively rejected by the international community because it violated the most basic of human rights , the right to life ; because it mutilated , tortured and violated human minds and bodies ; and because , with its underlying morbid and fascist philosophy , it aimed to paralyse social , political and cultural life and to obstruct the normal exercise of rights and freedoms .  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 , stressed the importance of the right to development as a universal and inalienable human right which should be treated by the international community , alongside other fundamental rights , globally in a fair and equal manner . 
In 1996 , a number of African countries encountered special development situations with the collapse of public and social services , disruption of economic activities , insecurity and armed conflict , the breakdown of law and order , massive population displacement and widespread human suffering .  
Takes note of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ;  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,  
Welcoming the fact that the call of the World Conference on Human Rights for a United Nations system _ wide approach to human rights issues has been reflected in the recommendations of major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ,  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient attention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Takes into account the Bangkok Declaration wherein it is recognized that while human rights are universal in nature , they must be considered in the context of a dynamic and evolving process of international norm _ setting , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Protocols thereto in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , and other pertinent international instruments ;  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Decides to consider the question of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions as a matter of priority at its fifty _ fourth session under the item entitled Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Takes into account the Bangkok Declaration wherein it is recognized that while human rights are universal in nature , they must be considered in the context of a dynamic and evolving process of international norm _ setting , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Reaffirms that the provision of advisory services and technical cooperation does not exempt any country from the monitoring activities of the human rights programme , and notes in this regard that , in order to produce lasting results , monitoring and preventive activities may need to be accompanied by promotional activities through advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirms that advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights require close cooperation and coordination between United Nations bodies and specialized agencies active in this field so as to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their respective programmes and avoid unnecessary duplication , and requests the High Commissioner to explore yet further possibilities for cooperation with specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as non _ governmental organizations ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
Furthermore , my Office 's overall efforts towards the economic reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina , functioning common institutions and the improvement of the overall human rights , policing and judicial situation can be expected to have beneficial effects for the provision of durable solutions for displaced persons and returning refugees .  
Considerable efforts have been made everywhere in Africa to revitalize the social sector , minimize needless waste of human and natural resources , promote popular participation and democratic governance , focus world attention on the continent 's needs for a more supportive international economic environment , and reinforce efforts at conflict prevention and resolution .  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
The Commission expects that the activities of the new human rights office in Bogot will contribute to improving the human rights situation in Colombia and to promoting a climate of trust between the Government and all sectors involved in the conflict , encouraging a process of constructive dialogue involving non _ governmental organizations and other sectors of civil society , and to preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Protocols thereto in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , and other pertinent international instruments ;  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Decides to consider the question of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions as a matter of priority at its fifty _ fourth session under the item entitled Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories . 
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms into conformity with international law and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment as well as harassment of and threats against human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to the prisons by non _ governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,  
Welcoming the fact that the call of the World Conference on Human Rights for a United Nations system _ wide approach to human rights issues has been reflected in the recommendations of major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ,  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , to retain on its agenda item 10 ( a ) , entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , and to give it due priority at its fifty _ fourth session , it being understood that action required by previous resolutions of the Commission on the subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary _ General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
A sound peace agreement which is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human , political and economic rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
In this connection , it is worth noting that during the fifteenth session of the Commission on Human Settlements , some delegations expressed their concern over the tendency of the Centre to spread its resources on activities that were largely tangential to its mandate and expressed the hope that the programme of work would remain focused on human settlements development as its prime objective .  
Indeed there is little evidence that Habitat has an institutional memory in the sense that it is capable either of presenting in a succinct form the essential lessons of working in the field of human settlements over the last 25 years , or that it would be possible to construct a computerized expert system based on the knowledge recorded and available within Habitat that could respond to basic randomly generated questions in this area .  
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
The European Union welcomes the formal undertaking by the Belarus authorities to initiate consultations with all the deputies of the elected thirteenth Supreme Soviet to establish a proper balance between the functions and duties of the members of the legislative , executive and judicial powers , as well as devise mechanisms that would strengthen respect for human rights and the position of the independent media .  
The arrangements agreed stress cooperation and coordination , and are rooted in recognition by all those involved of the need to achieve and maintain a streamlined process , avoiding duplication of effort and promoting efficiency and cost-effective use of human and financial resources while ensuring provision of the necessary information to the various fora charged with monitoring the actions of governments , their partners in civil society and those of international institutions , working in a coordinated manner to achieve the Summit objectives .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
The objectives will be met by providing support to the mechanisms for humanitarian coordination , emergency response and inter-agency collaboration at Headquarters and in the field through the Emergency Relief Coordinator , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the United Nations humanitarian or resident coordinators in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of people suffering from famine , displacement and human deprivation as a result of civil strife or other conflict-driven situations .  
To that end , the focus of the subprogramme will be on the role of the Organization in furthering economic and social development , democracy and human rights and peace and security , and enhancing the image of the United Nations as an efficient and effective organization capable of meeting the challenges posed in a rapidly changing international environment .  
In the resolution concerning the question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and study of special problems which the developing countries faced in their efforts to achieve those human rights , the Commission called upon States to secure , through national development policies and international cooperation , full respect for economic , social and cultural rights , giving priority to individuals , most often women , living in extreme poverty .  
In resolution 1997 / 33 , on the protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , States were urged , in collaboration and through the community , to promote a supportive and enabling environment for women , children and other vulnerable groups , by addressing underlying prejudices and inequalities through community dialogue , specially designed social and health services , and support community groups .  
Following a short discussion , the Sub-Commission , in resolution 1993 / 30 , expressed its appreciation to Mr . Chernichenko for that working paper and decided to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights his appointment as Special Rapporteur to prepare a report entitled Recognition of gross and large _ scale violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of Governments or sanctioned by them as an international crime .  
Gross and massive violations of human rights can be committed by local State bodies and officials , too , but the danger of such violations increases immeasurably when they are committed by , for example , a parliament passing racist laws , or a ministerial cabinet conducting a repressive policy .  
On the subject of human rights violations committed on the orders or with the sanction of Governments , it must be borne in mind that the term Government in this context is used not in the narrow sense , to designate the highest executive organ ( the council of ministers , cabinet or suchlike ) , but the entire system of State bodies , particularly legislative and executive , and the associated officials , since it is they who are most often the instigators when violations of human rights occur .  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of a Government or with its sanction to be international crimes will establish a firm basis in international law for addressing , first , the grave international legal responsibility of the State on behalf of which a Government acts and , second , the question of the criminal responsibility of officials perpetrating such violations .  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights ordered or sanctioned by a Government to be international crimes could to some extent help to prevent gross and massive violations of human rights by acting as a warning to Governments and public officials .  
The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
The responsibility of individuals , acting on behalf of a State and participating in the perpetration , by that State , of gross and massive violations of human rights constituting an international crime can be realized on the basis of the laws of the State which was injured as a result of the crime , on the basis of the laws of the State on behalf of which the individuals in question acted , or in accordance with an international agreement .  
In addition , the declaration must without fail refer to the inseparable link between the responsibility of the State that the perpetrated gross and massive violations of human rights which can be classified as international crimes and the individual responsibility of persons participating in their perpetration .  
Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted on 25 June 1993 , expressed grave concern about continuing human rights violations in all parts of the world in disregard of standards contained in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law and about the lack of sufficient and effective remedies for the victims ,  
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .  
Ten workshops : two annual regional workshops in Asia and the Pacific , for government representatives to discuss human rights issues that require a regional approach and initiatives , such as the establishment of regional arrangements for the protection and promotion of human rights ; two regional training courses in Africa and Asia on economic , social and cultural rights ; two specialized regional training courses in Latin America and Africa for trainers ; and two national training courses for lawyers and judges ; ( iii ) Fellowships .  
UNDP assistance under the fifth cycle country programme ( 1992-1996 ) to the Caribbean dependent Territories which includes the Turks and Caicos Islands , had as its principal focus the provision of support for human resource development , capacity-building , institutional strengthening and environment and natural resources management .  With this in view , the proposed strategy of UNDP at the start of the current sixth cycle has been to continue its emphasis on providing support in those areas , building upon the outputs of its previous interventions .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
There will be particular emphasis on strengthened planning and recruitment systems and methods , taking full account of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and gender balance ; staff learning , training and career development ; managed staff reassignment programmes ; established managerial competencies ; support to organizational and managerial reform ; improved work environment and managerial practices ; and better technical human resources management services and support to departments and offices .  
First and foremost , reinforcing peaceful conditions , a stable political framework , full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and effective participation by civil society are indispensable foundations for sustainable development .  
A more equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of risks require careful management of public policies and coordination of national and global policies dealing with markets , as well as stronger international support for infrastructure and human resources development in developing countries .  
In paragraphs 45 to 47 of my report of 7 February 1997 ( S / 1997 / 115 ) , I described in detail the challenges that would be faced by the administrative component of the follow-on mission , as logistical support would have to be provided to headquarters of the follow-on mission in Luanda , to the political , police , human rights and military components in six regional headquarters , and to almost all provincial capitals and over 30 other outstations .  
The High Contracting Parties shall base their relations with each other on the principles of mutual respect , sovereign equality , territorial integrity , the inviolability of borders , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of pressure , the right of peoples to control their own destiny , non-interference in internal affairs , observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , cooperation among States , and conscientious fulfilment of international obligations and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
The Presidents stressed the need for unconditional respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the preservation and development , in accordance with universally recognized norms , of the ethnic , linguistic , cultural and religious diversity of all peoples living in the Russian Federation and Ukraine .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
Moreover , the major donors stated in 1995 that the role of external partners is to help strengthen capacities in developing partner countries , and that the dominant conception of the mission of development assistance is to help countries and societies to strengthen their economic , human , social and institutional capacities for self-sustaining development .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on the respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
Particular emphasis should be given to the cooperative and collaborative efforts of the landlocked and transit developing countries in dealing with the transit problems , inter alia , through improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral agreements to govern transit transport operations ; development of joint ventures in the area of transit transport ; and strengthening of institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
In order to ensure democracy and human rights for all Afghan men and women , irrespective of religious , racial , ethnic and / or linguistic differences , based upon the recognized principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other related internationally accepted covenants in line with the tenets of Islamic Law ,  
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
United Nations agencies should encourage small States to adopt regional approaches , wherever advantageous , with relevant assistance justified in cost-benefit terms and focused on human resources development , environmental activities and reducing the administrative constraints imposed by small size .  
The Committee recommended the establishment of specific machinery located at the highest policy level , with adequate financial and human resources , that would coordinate and guide action in favour of women , would be able to prevent the persistence of attitudes , prejudices and stereotypes that discriminate against women and would narrow the gap between de jure and de facto equality .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
The main objective of the round table , following-up on the interregional round table held in Toronto , Canada , in September 1996 , was to monitor the manner in which ethical medical directives protected human rights .  
The participants agreed that , taken overall , these conferences and the Convention provided a basis on which to build not only the right of women to health but also the enjoyment of good health as a human right and that they exposed the extent of the poverty and economic dependence of women , the limited power exercised by many women over their sexual and reproductive life and their lack of influence over decisions , all of which social factors have a negative effect on their health .  
Since countries differed in terms of their living conditions , level of development , geographic characteristics and cultural traditions , there could be no uniform standard or model for solving the problems related to human settlements .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
The enormous challenges facing the housing sector and human settlements at the global level required new and more efficient modalities of international cooperation , including the dissemination of the " best practices " , as well as the political will of States to adopt appropriate measures in that area .  
In addition , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 47 / 180 , they had prepared national reports , established national committees with broad-based participation and made specific proposals and firm commitments regarding housing and human settlements at the national and international levels .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
Our overriding and ultimate concern is to ensure a clean and safe planet that is hospitable and friendly to human life , now and in the future .  
It is also understood that global sustainability will remain mere wishful thinking so long as the rich industrialized countries continue to undermine the ecological life-support system of the human family by wasting resources .  
The preamble common to the two International Covenants on Human Rights recognizes that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights . 
The 1968 Proclamation of Tehran reaffirmed that human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible ; in the context of that interdependence , the realization of economic , social and cultural rights is of crucial importance for the effective exercise of civil and political rights .  
Article 1 , paragraph 3 , stipulates that one of the Purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
It was erected into a system of government and applied for about a century accompanied by violations of human rights , both economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights .  
The right to a healthy environment has been violated as a result of human activities which increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , with all the consequent effects on global warming , rising sea levels and climate in general .  
While producing their own negative effects on the enjoyment of human rights in general and economic , social and cultural rights in particular , these phenomena have multiplier effects which also exacerbate the increasingly serious and numerous problems faced by the populations of poor regions .  
When genetic variations are lost , therefore , the result is not only that specific and potential properties and adaptations are lost but also that the number of species is diminished , ecosystems are impaired and the ability to sustain human life is damaged .  
Any transaction for the transfer of wastes is a serious violation of the right to a healthy environment and , quite obviously , of the whole set of human rights , whether individual or collective , economic , social and cultural or civil and political .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , in its resolution 16 / 24 of 7 May 1997 entitled " Special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 " , reaffirmed that sustainable development was essential for human settlements development and expressed the conviction that urban settlements , properly planned and managed , held a promise for human development and for the protection of the world 's natural resources through their ability to support large numbers of people while limiting their negative impact on the natural environment .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; equal opportunity for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; equal opportunity for participation in public decision-making ; equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
It can not be overemphasized that discrimination between human beings on the grounds of race , colour or ethnic origin is an obstacle to friendly and peaceful relations among nations and is capable of disturbing peace and security among peoples as well as the harmony of people living side by side even within the same State .  
That the publishers and editors at this meeting believe in peaceful and creative understanding and tolerance and in the educational potential of the press as a means of transmitting values based on respect for the life and dignity of human beings and of encouraging cooperation for the consolidation of a culture of peace . 
Efforts should be made by the international community and intergovernmental bodies and organizations to establish cooperative relations with the authorities in Afghanistan in order to assist in the eradication of illicit cultivation , production and trafficking of narcotic drugs , especially in the drug-producing areas of the country , and to provide them with packages of aid and the means of economic reform , such as human development and capacity-building , mobilization of resources and industrial development to enable them to resort to alternative sources of income , which would provide better economic possibilities for future generations ;  
In contrast to the positions adopted by some human rights bodies which considered that once the reservation was deemed impermissible the reserving State continued to be bound by the treaty as a whole , he emphasized that the treaty was still a consensual instrument , drawing its strength from the will of States . 37 / The reservations made , he said , were consubstantial with the State 's consent to be bound by the treaty . 
The success of collective response to humanitarian crises depends not only on a well _ coordinated and integrated plan of action , but also on the availability of the human , material and financial resources necessary to ensure that timely assistance is provided .  
Injustice , political oppression , human rights abuses , social and economic inequalities , and the absence of democratic freedom and development opportunities are often part of a complex mix of underlying factors contributing to conflict . 
The consultations had provided an opportunity for agencies to present their activities and to discuss possible cooperation on , for example : joint input to the Commission on Human Rights , the Sub-Commission and the Working Group , the provision of relevant information to be included on a website page , joint minority-related technical cooperation projects , submission of information on system-wide complaints procedures , input into the treaty bodies , dissemination of the recommendations and resolutions of supervisory bodies , and the provision of training on minority-related human rights instruments at regional and national levels .  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of exerting pressure , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
I would like to refer to my announcement to the Security Council on 8 July 1997 that I intended to appoint an investigative team in order to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 , and to the briefing the Council received on the subject on 30 July .  
I have the honour to inform you that your letter dated 1 August 1997 ( S / 1997 / 617 ) concerning your decision to appoint Mr . Atsu-Koffi Amega ( Togo ) and Mr . Andrew R . Chigovera ( Zimbabwe ) to be respectively the Chairman and a member of the investigative team to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 has been brought to the attention of the members of the Council .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
Recalling also that , in its resolution 40 / 61 of 9 December 1985 , the General Assembly stated that it was mindful of the necessity of maintaining and safeguarding the basic rights of the individual in accordance with the relevant human rights instruments and generally accepted international standards ,  
There had been thinly veiled attempts at altering the demographic composition and physical characteristics of the occupied Palestinian territory , incessant human rights violations , plundering of the territory 's natural resources and exploitation of its labour force .  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining the multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
A sound peace agreement that is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human ( political and economic ) rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
Noting that the appointment of a special rapporteur had now become advisable , Ms . Palley drew the attention of the working group to five issues : the legality of privatization under international human rights law ; the extent of delegation of duties possible under privatization ; the question of whether United Nations standards must be further developed ; the minimum safeguards required ; the most appropriate human rights monitoring method for private prisons .  
Mr . Weissbrodt stated that Mr . Chernichenkos important work greatly assisted the groups understanding of relevant aspects of international law , particularly in defining gross and massive violations of human rights .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Decides to authorize the inclusion of this question in the preliminary document concerning a study in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , to be submitted to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the Purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Acknowledging that indigenous peoples in many countries have been deprived of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and that many of the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples are linked to the historical and continuing deprivation of ancestral rights over lands , territories and resources ,  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 46 / 122 of 17 December 1991 by which it established the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery to assist representatives of non _ governmental organizations to participate in the deliberations of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery by providing them with financial assistance and to extend through established channels of assistance , humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of contemporary forms of slavery ,  
Included in this latter group are the United Nations political and economic and social departments ( Department of Political Affairs , Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department for Economic and Social Affairs ) and the World Health Organization . The political departments of the United Nations Secretariat consider the Agency 's support for the rule of law , promotion of human rights , democratization , human capacity-building and electoral assistance as strong potential areas , particularly in respect of cooperation for peacekeeping and peace-building programmes . 
In addition to natural capital , physical or produced capital , and to the now widely accepted notion of human capital , social capital refers to the functioning of the various institutions that are critical to individual welfare and social integration .  
The Sub _ Commission recognizes the efforts of the Government of Guatemala and urges it to continue with its policy of implementing measures for the protection and promotion of both individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to continue to take practical measures against poverty and to eradicate extreme poverty in order to raise the living standards of the population ; and to redouble the efforts already instituted to overcome the marginalization and discrimination to which the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have been , and continue to be subjected .  
However , the increased international attention to , and importance of , transparency of transfers and possession of conventional arms are justified by the fact that these conventional arms cause serious human suffering in international and internal conflicts and are not subject to legal regimes in many parts of the world .  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development , as proclaimed by the General Assembly in resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , where stress is laid on the multidimensional , integrated and dynamic character of this right which promotes partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aimed at universal and effective observance of all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
Requests Governments , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations and the specialized agencies , actively to support local , national and international initiatives , including the development of human rights indicators , aimed at assessing and improving the housing and living conditions of women throughout the world , in full consultation with and with the full participation of women themselves , their representatives and community _ based non _ governmental organizations and other relevant groups ;  
Having considered the final report of Mr . Leandro Despouy on Protection of human rights during states of emergency and the tenth annual list of States which , since 1 January 1985 , have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 19 and Add . 1 ) ,  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Guided by the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations , particularly Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter , which stipulates that one of the Purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion ,  
In resolution 1997 / 15 , the Commission decided to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts to meet prior to the fifty-fourth session of the Commission with a mandate to : ( a ) gather all relevant information from Governments , non-governmental organizations and any other relevant sources on the obstacles existing to the effective and full protection of the human rights of migrants ; and ( b ) elaborate recommendations to strengthen the promotion , protection and implementation of the human rights of migrants .  
We recognize that poverty , unemployment and other obstacles to human development , such as civil strife and war , as well as crime and social injustices , render our States and societies vulnerable to transnational organized crime and corruption ; and we are , therefore , resolved to undertake and intensify all necessary steps and measures to address such problems , with the cooperation and support of the international community .  
It was also recommended that the indicative list of criminal activities contained in article 1 of the draft framework convention should be supplemented with the following crimes : trafficking in illegal migrants ; extortion ; kidnapping ; cattle-rustling ; export of toxic wastes ; illicit export of precious raw materials ; trafficking in protected species ; international fraud ; sexual exploitation of children ; trafficking in human organs ; and violation of intellectual property rights .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
The integration of women into the management of public affairs was therefore not only part of an economic policy strategy aimed at achieving integrated and sustainable development but was also consistent with a coherent and global perspective on human rights .  
The current setting is characterized by the need for ( i ) larger capital resources , ( ii ) sophisticated technology , including information technology which can improve management practices and assure instantaneous access to information , and ( iii ) human skills for access to global markets .  
Mineral resource development may provide a boost to developing economies otherwise poor in natural and human resources and allow rapid economic growth , provided that the problems of macro-economic stability associated with mineral dependence , in particular the influence of mineral revenues on the real exchange rate and the effect of mining wage rates on overall wage levels , can be mastered .  
In conclusion , since environmental concerns found expression in diametrically opposite ways depending on economic situations and the geographical location of the countries concerned , efforts by the international community would become effective only when there was an emphasis on the human dimension of the consequences of environmental changes , which should be fully reflected in the post-1997 phase of implementation of Agenda 21 . 
The notion of sustainable human settlements must therefore be integrated more systematically both at the national level and within the United Nations system ; a dialogue must be established between civil society and its representatives , and cooperation among local Governments that had to resolve similar problems and between the various levels of government must be strengthened .  
In addition to the exodus from the countryside and chaotic urbanization , problems common to all developing countries , Lebanon encountered other difficulties : the destruction of housing and infrastructure ; the collapse of economic and cultural institutions ; the displacement of more than 100,000 families ; an unbalanced geographical distribution of the population ; a rise in unemployment ; the devastation of arable land ; stagnation in industry , tourism and commerce ; frequent human rights violations ; a breakdown of social and moral values ; growing drug use ; and increasing juvenile crime . 
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
As a result of the major conferences held during the 1990s , the international community had adopted a development model that encompassed objectives in the areas of economic growth , social progress , environmental protection and respect for human rights , which the member countries of MERCOSUR and Bolivia and Chile had decided to make into reality .  
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .  
Even though participants in the Conference had included the main representatives of the public , private and community sectors involved in the development of human settlements , the appeal which had been made at the Conference could not bear fruit without assistance and cooperation at the national level and , in particular , without the solidarity and effective and timely delivery of international contributions .  
That consensus had found concrete expression in the declarations and programmes of action of the major United Nations conferences , the themes of which - economic growth , the environment , population , human rights , social development , the advancement of women and human settlements - now should be articulated in the agenda for development , a fundamental document which should guide development worldwide on the eve of the twenty-first century .  
Three basic principles were embodied in the agenda : the multidimensional nature of the development process , encompassing such elements as sustainable economic growth , social justice , good governance and respect for human rights , including equal rights for women ; the need for an integrated approach at both the national and the international level , while ensuring their concomitance ; and the responsibility of each agent of development , giving priority to national action .  
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
The highest aim in their common belief is the human dimension of this joint initiative , which , as a continuing process , through comprehensive cooperation , should provide rapid economic development and prosperity to the peoples of the region .  
In view of the continued conflict and human tragedy in Afghanistan and the stalemated efforts to involve all the parties concerned in constructive and viable political dialogue , on 29 July , I appointed Mr . Lakhdar Brahimi as my Special Envoy on a short mission to consult interested and relevant countries and parties , as well as the Organization of the Islamic Conference , and to present a comprehensive review of the United Nations peacemaking activities in Afghanistan . 
The United Nations and the League of Arab States expressed their concern over the continuing problem of landmines and other unexploded devices that are causing serious human suffering and which have negative social and economic effects on mine-infested countries over an extended period .  
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
Leaders thanked the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands for his presentation on the Forum theme of reform , human values and togetherness and discussed how reforms aimed at achieving sustainable development should go beyond conventional economic dimensions to embrace the essentially holistic nature of the process , and took cognizance of the need for Pacific cultural values and norms to be the basic premise and foundation of this process and the work of regional institutions .  
Beyond the human cost , debt had created serious obstacles to economic growth by absorbing up to one fifth of export earnings , exhausting their limited stocks of foreign exchange and undermining their ability to engage in international trade on more equitable terms .  
Having received no response to the request he made in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur reiterates the urgent request he made to the existing Government to provide , as promised earlier by Major Buyoya , the results of the investigation into allegations of the expulsion manu militari of 392 Burundian refugees in Rwanda to Cibitoke province , on 30 September 1996 , by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front , at a time when numerous violations of human rights were being reported in that region .  
It should be recalled that the alternative site given to the Jahalin is located on rocky and windy land 500 metres from the Jerusalem garbage dump and was declared by an Israeli environmental study to be unfit for human habitation .  
For module two , covering supply reduction , the main focus areas are : adoption of a balanced and integrated approach to drug control ; development activities aimed at structural factors ; coordinated subregional efforts based on similar legislation ; crop replacement efforts including promotion of sustainable agriculture ; reliable data for measuring opium poppy cultivation ; political support by Governments ; capacity-building and human resources development ; and collection of information on experiences in alternative development .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .  
In subsequent statements , particularly , those entitled " political development policies " of the executive branches , emphasis was again placed on respecting human dignity and integrity ; ensuring civil rights and freedom ; defending public trials and the right to a lawyer ; fostering an independent mass media ; and fostering the principles of pluralism and diversity .  
They facilitate the spread of an economic model based on the principles of a market economy , while mass advertising and the global media help shape human aspirations and perceptions of social values .  
The principle of the indivisibility of universally recognized civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights continues to be a key element of today 's system for the promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms .  
All human rights political , civil , social and economic are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
These unresolved conflicts undermine the political , economic and social fabric of the States concerned , bringing destruction and untold human suffering to the victims of war .  
Only an efficient universal organization can help us cope with the pressing challenges of globalization , economic and social development , environmental changes and the urgent need to protect and respect human rights .  
The United Nations must view all human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural as universal , indivisible , interdependent , interrelated and embedded in the trinity of democracy , development and human rights .  
Their ultimate sacrifice reminds us that human beings are capable of great altruism in the face of suffering and of calm when faced with the destructive passion of armed conflict , even at the risk of their own lives .  
The United States has certainly designed a blockade that , like a vile medieval garrotte , has managed with slow and pyrrhic success to bring about innumerable shortages to 11-million human beings and has greatly hampered the country 's normal development .  
This remains crucial for the economic development of small economies whose vulnerabilities are intensified by our limited access to markets , narrow resource base , small size , inadequate levels of human resource development and proneness to natural disasters .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
Direct consequences of this fighting are the continuing massive loss of human life , killing , refugee flows , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive economic destruction .  
We are distressed about this downward trend , characterized by the widespread loss of human life and a worsening pattern of grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
At both the national and international levels , institutions to promote and protect human rights economic and social , as well as civil and political have spread , and often have flourished .  
As the first comprehensive international proclamation of the basic rights of the individual , it established a common understanding of human rights for mankind .  
Recalling these words , spoken 50 years ago , reminds us that human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social are indivisible .  
Despite the progress achieved , the increasing tragedies and the escalation of massive and systematic violations are brutal reminders of the ease and frequency with which the noble ideal of defending human rights can be compromised .  
The promulgation of numerous international legal human rights instruments ; notable action taken against racism , racial discrimination , religious intolerance and torture ; and support for democratization : these are some of the noteworthy elements of that work .  
We shall continue our determined action to promote a national and global order based on justice and equity in which all human rights are preserved , promoted and protected in the true spirit of the Universal Declaration . The President took the Chair . 
For many Governments , human rights is often raised as a mere slogan , or is used as a political instrument to be applied against enemies , glossed over with friends and neglected where direct national interests warrant it . 
Cooperation at the international level is important in ensuring the promotion of all human rights , bearing in mind that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
In Eritrea , foreign nationals , whatever their origin , were treated justly , in accordance with the law and their human rights were respected ; there had not been a single incident involving ethnic or national minorities in the seven years since independence .  
The fighting is again causing enormous suffering for the Afghan people and adds to their misery , while human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law continue to be violated with impunity .  
This is a space devoid of the most basic human values ; a space in which children are slaughtered , raped and maimed ; a space in which children are exploited as soldiers ; a space in which children are starved and exposed to extreme brutality .  
The Internet had the alarming potential of creating and reinforcing an electronically disenfranchised underclass , which would prevent the improvement of racial equality in a growing range of human and social needs and transactions .  
Moreover , the rules generally applicable to reservations were sufficiently flexible and adaptable to be applied with equal authority in the case of human rights and other normative treaties and should not be revised .  
Transnational corporations now have greater freedom to set up in countries where , owing to political , economic or social constraints or a lack of human and financial resources , environmental legislation is rudimentary , non _ existent or poorly enforced .  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
Under common article 3 , rape has also been charged in isolated instances of rape and other instances of sexual assault and sexual mutilation as cruel treatment , an outrage upon human dignity and humiliating and degrading treatment .  
The explicit linking of water issues to human development and economic productivity is generally lacking both in terms of national policy declarations and supporting legislative and administrative support .  
With water a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , the imperative remains to manage all freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality within minimum acceptable standards .  
The independent expert considered that the advisory services programme had not provided sufficient support for surveys required prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or for the preparation of reports by States in need of assistance .  
Committed to the full development of human potential within just and inclusive societies attentive to the promotion of harmonious and equitable relations among individuals belonging to diverse ethnic and religious groups ;  
With water as a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , there is an imperative need to manage land and freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality to minimum acceptable standards .  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area since small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
Stressing the fact that realization of the full range of human rights requires effective policies and compliance at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative to an effective anti-drugs strategy .  
A strong programme of advisory services and technical cooperation was identified by the World Conference as a major contribution to building national capacities and thus improving respect for human rights .  
Aass ( Norway ) said that the establishment of an international criminal court would be instrumental in providing a judicial response in cases where gross violations of human rights occurred and national jurisdictions proved inadequate .  
These include the universal , indivisible , and interdependent and interrelated nature of human rights , which must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis .  
Central to the right to development is the realization that all human rights are interdependent and indivisible and that durable economic and social progress requires respect for civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights .  
These are activities which can clearly signal a commitment to address human rights issues and to build a society in which all can live freely and to provide a solid legal framework for economic development which will aid national and international investment .  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Emphasizes that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that , as such , the international community must treat them globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ;  
Noting that El Nino has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area because small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
However , the unique demographic , economic and geographic constraints faced by small island developing States call for a strengthening of the concerted efforts at human resource development .  
The challenge now is to combine this complex policy and organizational mix at the local , national and international levels into a critical mass that can lead to significant changes in human behaviour .  
The human rights treaty system , established under the six operative international human rights treaties , consists of a voluntary system of self-monitoring by way of reporting , supervised by six independent and expert international committees .  
Growth was still constrained by a number of factors common to many LDCs , including poor physical and institutional infrastructure , aggravated by the landlocked nature of his country , low levels of human resource development and a high incidence of poverty .  
The CRC has reaffirmed the indivisible and interrelated nature of all human rights and fundamental freedoms addressing the civil , political , and economic , social and cultural rights of children .  
The Principles also provide that persons alleged to have committed these grave human rights violations should be suspended from any official duties during the investigation and removed from any position of control or power , whether direct or indirect .  
All human rights are universal , and States are obliged to respect those rights , regardless of whether they are of an economic , social , cultural , civil or political character .  
It also included a compilation of the views of Committee members on the report of the independent expert on the functioning of the human rights treaty bodies and addressed issues raised at the eighth meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies .  
While human rights education was not an obligatory part of the national curriculum , the concept of the equal worth of human beings was among the basic values taught at the primary school level .  
Recognizing that human rights were universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , the international community as a whole should strive towards a fair and equitable promotion and implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative for an effective anti-drugs strategy .

Components of the United Nations system should address , within their respective mandates , major obstacles to the implementation of all human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as well as serious violations of those rights .  
The difficulty in providing adequate health care , the continued practice of open drainage , the indiscriminate disposal of waste water and industrial effluents and rampant water pollution have resulted in the creation of mega-slums unsuitable for human living .

With the combined technological advances in molecular biology and rapid sequence reading by computers , scientists are able to identify unique genetic data in human DNA from the collection of hair , blood , tissue , mucous membrane and saliva samples .  
That required an approach to development which valued responsible economic management , respected human rights , affirmed gender equity , assured access to productive assets and met basic human needs .  
When UNDP had elaborated a notion of human development which covered a broad array of political , economic and social criteria , it had not included culture .

It recognized the inherent dignity and worth of the human person and proclaimed the ideal of every member of the human family living free from fear and want .  
It was ironic that a State which considered itself an international champion of human rights saw fit to direct others towards civilized solutions , but was unable to deal with its own colonial legacy .  
In conformity with its humanitarian ideal , his Government considered that the human dimension , especially the social , economic and cultural rights of the people , should be taken into account whenever sanctions were imposed .  
In addition , the conversion of policy declarations into concrete policies and actions at both the national and the international levels required not only political will but also adequate allocations of financial and human resources .

Although international humanitarian law , refugee law and human rights law are often treated as separate branches of international law , they all have a common goal of protecting individuals from harm and should therefore be considered as complementary .  
One law worthy of note is the Environmental Protection Act of 10 December 1996 , one main objective of which is to defend the human right in environmental matters that is laid down in the Constitution : the right to live in a healthy environment ( article 37.3 ) .

The basic curriculum , pursuant to which the subject curriculum for pre-university education is under elaboration , is based on fundamental principles regarding general human , social and cultural values .  
Ad hoc requests by international agencies lead to ad hoc data collection , crowding out limited financial and human resources , and thus interfering with regular national statistical programmes ;

Following clarification of conceptual , terminological and normative ambiguities remaining in the guidelines , through a broad consultative process , the expert plans to ensure that the Guidelines and Principles can gain wide international support and be formulated in a way that can best advance the right of victims to compensation , reparation and restitution for human rights violations .  
While the situation of human rights in Croatia had been improving constantly since the end of the conflict and since the Croatian Governments establishment of control over the entire territory of Croatia , and while that situation had definitely improved in Bosnia and Herzegovina , it had worsened in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , where numerous conflicts had broken out and there had been a renewed outbreak of human rights violations .

As a result of unchecked environmental degradation , we anticipate an increasing number of human health crises , involving the spread of infectious diseases , more cases of malnutrition and increasing health problems associated with global atmospheric change .  
The meeting addressed the workshops logistic arrangements and its substantive content , including technical cooperation activities to be considered and proposed , and identified numerous issues of criminal procedure that the workshop could address , such as those relating to data storage , transaction and analysis , electronic communications , trans-border search and seizure , mutual legal assistance , human rights and safeguarding privacy rights .  
Regarding the definition of injured State contained in article 40 , clarification is needed with respect to the phrase the right has been created or is established for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in paragraph 2 ( e ) ( iii ) , and the phrase for the protection of the collective interests of the State parties thereto in paragraph 2 ( f ) .  What is intended in article 42 , paragraph 2 , and article 43 , subparagraph ( d ) , is not defined clearly .  
Reaffirming that the full implementation of the Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and , to that end , recognizing that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ,  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
A number of oral and written statements were submitted to the Subcommission on various issues , such as the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , right to development , religious intolerance , protection of minorities , indigenous persons , and terrorism and human rights . 
In many respects , those conditions did not meet contemporary international standards in the field of human rights or the requirements of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 , which the General Assembly had determined was applicable to the occupied territories . 
Concerned that human rights and fundamental freedoms are not fully and universally respected and continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and that some peoples still lack the full enjoyment of their right of self-determination ,  
Reaffirming that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat them globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Declares solemnly its commitment to the fulfilment of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations and as a source of inspiration for the further promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms political , economic , social , civil and cultural including the right to development .

IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
In its report on its fourth session ( E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) , IPF concluded that there is a need for a broad set of reliable data of high integrity , covering social , cultural , economic , ecological , institutional and legal aspects of forests , in order to have an adequate grasp of progress as well as of the impact of the state of forests on the environment , human well-being and the economy .  
It has continued to implement the good offices mandate vested in my Special Representative by conducting an active dialogue with the authorities and all other major political forces in the country ; encouraging cross-party dialogue and a better understanding among the various segments of the population with a view to easing inter-ethnic tensions ; and promoting the application of international standards of human rights .  
In pursuing a comprehensive model of preventive action , UNPREDEP has also been involved in a wide range of programmes related to good governance and the rule of law , strengthening of national capacity and infrastructure , institution - building and human resources development in the governmental and civil sectors .  
It was recognized that extreme poverty hindered full enjoyment of human rights and that economic , social , political and cultural rights were universal and inseparable .  
The view was also expressed that international human rights instruments limited the scope of national jurisdiction by guaranteeing uniform standards of protection , whereas diplomatic protection functioned exclusively in relations between States and after domestic remedies had been exhausted .  
Moreover , juridical bodies for the protection of human rights , unlike those concerned with diplomatic protection , were well established in both the internal legal order and the international system ; that was a matter that the Commission should consider .  
There was a growing realization that business was not only about wealth creation but also about assuming social responsibilities for issues such as humans rights and sustainable human development , and that globalization and trade liberalization had had some unforeseen negative effects , including financial instability .  
There is thus a need for strengthened international cooperation with a view to enhancing the legal protection of vulnerable groups in internal conflict , to improve international monitoring and to promote an active role of the international community in protecting human rights and fundamental humanitarian standards in such situations .  
We also welcome the determined and energetic position of Ms . Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , who has understood perfectly the magnitude of our responsibility to future generations and the vital importance of protecting children as one of the sectors whose vulnerability puts in jeopardy the very existence of the human race on our blue planet . 
As all are aware , my country was not the victim of a civil war , but rather the situation of crisis that it has faced has numerous characteristics that are generally typical of a war situation , such as massive migrations of population and violations of human rights , a population held hostage and polarized and a ruined economy .  
When human rights are used to advance one single political agenda while the rights of countless others are ignored , human rights are denigrated , becoming a political instrument of narrow interests instead of a universal standard for the protection of all humanity .  
Support to peacekeeping exercises focuses on the multidimensional and multinational aspects of this training and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations routinely provides not just military and civilian police role players and trainers , but also Special Representatives of the Secretary-General , political , legal and public information staff members and humanitarian , human rights and non-governmental organization coordinators .

Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the childs achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Noting with grave concern , that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
In the final phase , a global strategy against trafficking in human beings will be formulated in close consultation with relevant national and international organizations and presented for adoption by the international community , possibly at a high-level forum .  
Failure in the implementation of policies for forest conservation and protected areas , because of inadequate coordination or existence of conflicting polices and practices , inappropriate implementation strategies or a lack of institutional financial and human resources , is widely acknowledged as a major reason for the failure to achieve forest conservation goals in some countries .  
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
While conditionality is a contentious issue as it is considered to be undermining the sovereignty of nations , it is desirable as long as it is based on human development and human rights criteria , and on broad consultation with civil society organizations and national Governments .  
Recalling that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Reiterates the importance of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action which reaffirms the right to development , as established by the Declaration on the Right to Development , as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights and also reaffirms that the human person is the central subject of development ;  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the foundations necessary for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Affirms that international cooperation is acknowledged more than ever as a necessity deriving from recognized mutual interest and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial and arbitrary executions , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , forced relocation and denial of freedom of expression , assembly , association and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continuing coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross-purposes ;  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religious persuasion , association and movement and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the increasingly ethnic and religious nature of the conflict , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
Deeply concerned , however , about the wide gap that continues to exist between the promise of human rights and their promotion and protection worldwide , and deeply concerned also about denials and violations of human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social including the right to development ,  
Reaffirming the important role of non-governmental organizations in the promotion of all human rights and in humanitarian activities at the national , regional and international levels , and appreciating their contribution to increasing public awareness of human rights issues , to the conduct of education , training and research in this field , and to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
On behalf of the Ministry of Human Rights , I extend my sincere thanks to the national human rights organizations and eminent Congolese civilians who , at the risk of their lives , have provided the Ministry with information on serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the eastern provinces , thereby contributing to the preparation of this white paper .  
During the war of liberation ( 1996-1997 ) , which was intended to put an end to the Mobutu dictatorship by restoring to the Congolese people its long-affronted dignity and establishing a State governed by the rule of law and respectful of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the Alliance des Forces Dmocratiques pour la Libration du Congo ( ADFL ) had accepted military and logistical assistance from several friendly countries , including Rwanda and Uganda .  
The table appended to this document is only a snapshot , giving no more than an indication , albeit a revealing one , of the blatant , deliberate and massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Rwandan , Ugandan and Burundian aggressors in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Against a background of violations of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law , the economic , social and cultural rights of the Congolese are being violated by looting , extortion and destruction of installations and property essential for the survival of the population .  65 .  Other violations of human rights and international humanitarian law deserve to be highlighted .  
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
Based on past experience and the changes brought about by the rapid globalization of the economy , there had been a growing convergence of policies that encouraged investment in human resources and government responsibility in creating a dynamic domestic framework in which the private sector could play its role as the driving force of industrial development .  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed training , dissemination and information programmes can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Even when political leaders have thoroughly good intentions , human rights norms as expressed in the Constitution and the international conventions need to be underpinned by sound legislation , an effective and independent judiciary and a non-partisan , professional police .  
In the light of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially the principles of the best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and the right to life , survival and development ( art . 6 ) , the Committee expressed its deep concern at the early legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces and recommended that the State party raise the age in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
The Special Rapporteur observes that the human tragedy of this unresolved matter is enormous , both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship , and in terms of the families of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert the utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
There is an enormous annual turnover in markets for illegal goods , such as illegal drugs , protected wildlife , stolen works of art , illegal firearms , and nuclear and / or toxic waste , as well as for trafficking in human beings .  
National plans of action for human rights education , which have been called for both by the General Assembly and the Commission , are intended to be an integral part of the national development plan ( when applicable ) and be complementary to other relevant national plans of action already defined ( general human rights plans of action or those relating to women , children , minorities , indigenous peoples , etc . ) .  
Depending on their specific mandate , field presences implement technical cooperation programmes to support governmental and civil society institutions in strengthening their capacity for the promotion and protection of human rights , through training , legal assistance , expert advice , public education and other activities .  
This would include , inter alia , ratification of the main human rights instruments , adoption of national plans of action , establishment and strengthening of independent national institutions , human rights education , identification of progress in the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights , technical cooperation and preparation for the World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance .  
The activities undertaken to mark the anniversary by Governments , international and regional organizations and , most notably , by civil society at all levels - local , national , regional and international _ have also provided clear evidence of a reinvigorated commitment to human rights as the common principles which should unite the international community as a new century begins . 
The Assembly adopted resolution 53 / 168 on the fiftieth anniversary in which it declared its commitment to the fulfilment of the Declaration as a source of inspiration for the further promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms - political , social , civil and cultural _ including the right to development .  
The purpose of the OHCHR technical cooperation programme is to assist countries - including Governments and civil society - in promoting and protecting all human rights at the national and regional levels , through the incorporation of international human rights standards in national laws , policies and practices , and building a sustainable national capacity to implement these standards and ensure respect for human rights .  
Technical cooperation activities are based on international human rights standards as defined in the instruments adopted within the United Nations and on international practice in applying them in all regions of the world , giving balanced attention to civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
The Office of Operations leads the planning process by providing the overall framework , developing options for courses of action , leading reconnaissance missions to the field and coordinating and integrating inputs from within the Department and from other entities ( e.g . military , police , humanitarian , electoral , human rights and other aspects including logistics , support and staffing requirements ) into a comprehensive plan for approval by the Security Council .  
If , in addition , one considered the frequent violations of the human rights of the Palestinian and Arab population , the severe conditions under which members of that population were held in custody and the frequent closures of Palestinian territory , it was easy to understand how difficult it was for the Palestinian population to hold on to the optimism and hope engendered by the various peace agreements that had been concluded since 1991 .  
Even the initial analysis of the recommendations and proposals made by several United Nations bodies and mechanisms active in the field of human rights makes it possible to single out a number of major themes that could be considered by the World Conference with a view to formulating recommendations for the adoption of additional measures to combat racism at the national , regional and international levels .  
In the light of ethnic hatred , propaganda and incitement to ethnic killing in the Great Lakes region of Africa , Oxfam suggested that all Governments that prohibit and condemn racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should reinvigorate their commitment to the relevant aspects of international human rights law and international humanitarian law .  
Such a commitment could strengthen resect for the human rights of all and promote the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , in particular , key elements for peaceful coexistence , mutual understanding and tolerance among societies and the international community .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Notes that the United Nations Programme of Advisory Services and Technical Assistance in the Field of Human Rights does not have sufficient funds to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but are facing economic hardship ;  
Reiterating that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and should be promoted and implemented in a fair and equitable manner , without prejudice to the implementation of each of those rights and freedoms ,  
Each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect , promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms , inter alia , by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social , economic , political and other fields , as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction , individually and in association with others , are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice .  
This includes , inter alia , the right , individually and in association with others , to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion , protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
To complain about the policies and actions of individual officials and governmental bodies with regard to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , by petition or other appropriate means , to competent domestic judicial , administrative or legislative authorities or any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State , which should render their decision on the complaint without undue delay ;  
In this connection , everyone is entitled , individually and in association with others , to be protected effectively under national law in reacting against or opposing , through peaceful means , activities and acts , including those by omission , attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Popular and / or politically driven anti-foreigner sentiment based on racial , ethnic , national or religious characteristics is a strong obstacle both to recognition of and respect for the human rights of migrants .  
Another important group of migrants who are exposed to serious human rights abuses are those engaged in the informal economy of the receiving countries , where small and less competitive enterprises , especially in textile , garment-making and various service industries , try to save on social and labour costs by hiring cheap and often irregular migrant workers , increasingly with the help of traffickers .  
Even in countries where general human rights and social legislation is well advanced , the working and living conditions of these migrant workers are often comparable to those of the slave labour conditions prevailing at the end of the nineteenth century .  
States , in particular those which have already included international human rights standards in national legislation , should be urged to extend these basic rights to migrants explicitly , through appropriate legal enactment , due account being taken of the special needs and conditions of the various types of migrants ( recruitment , job and housing security , family reunion , education and social security ) .  
These initiatives should run parallel to , and not be regarded as a substitute for , efforts to secure increased ratification and effective implementation of the existing international treaties concerning human rights , including the 1990 Convention on migrants .  
Since the informal economy which harbours a significant proportion of irregular migrants operates largely at the periphery or outside the national protection system , States should be encouraged to extend the basic human rights standards to this sector and to enforce them , and to assist enterprises to improve their economic capacity , thereby enabling them to meet these standards .  
In accordance with its mandate , the Mission is required to verify both that due process is observed and that the competent national bodies carry out such investigations as may be required in an independent and effective manner , in accordance with the Constitution and with international human rights norms .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
An illegal act which violates human rights and which is initially not directly imputable to the State ( for example , because it is the act of a private person or because the person responsible has not been identified ) can lead to international responsibility of the State , not because of the act itself but because of the lack of due diligence to prevent the violation or to respond to it as required by the Convention .  
The Sudan expressed concern about the children in the southern part of the country , particularly those living in areas occupied by the rebel movement , where they were being exploited , forcibly conscripted , used as human shields , tortured and killed , which must be denounced and condemned by the entire international community .  
Conducted seminars on the law of the sea , University of Dar es Salaam ( 1976-1980 ) ; attended numerous seminars at national and international level on constitutional law , humanitarian and human rights law , international law .  
While the question of poverty must be dealt with primarily as a violation of human rights and of the right to development , the measures to be taken for its eradication required integrated approaches encompassing its economic , social , cultural , educational , demographic and other dimensions .  
As far as his country was concerned , the efforts to reduce poverty and ensure social peace had been based on the plans of action formulated at the major United Nations conferences , and were aimed at achieving a form of development which reconciled growth and environmental protection , while ensuring a decent minimum income and the exercise of basic human rights for all citizens .  
The Republic of Colombia is constitutionally defined as a unitary , decentralized and autonomous State , which has a republican system of government and whose legal and political organization is based on respect for human dignity .  
The deterioration of the human rights situation is the result of the worsening of the armed conflict and the failure by the Government to implement effective legislative , administrative and other measures , such as those intended to combat paramilitary activity and impunity or to protect human rights advocates .  
We recommend that , as a matter of prosecutorial policy , the independent prosecutor appointed by the United Nations limit his or her investigations to those persons most responsible for the most serious violations of international human rights law and exercise his or her discretion regarding investigations , indictments and trials so as to fully take into account the twin goals of individual accountability and national reconciliation in Cambodia .  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , including statistical data , findings and results of action-oriented research and high-quality analysis and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and corruption ;  
Her delegation strongly condemned all acts , methods and practice of terrorism regardless of who committed them and for what purpose , because they targeted the lives and property of innocent people , violated basic human rights and posed a serious threat to regional and international peace and security .  
Human rights are understood to be the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the third generation of human rights set forth in the Constitution , the laws and the treaties in force , together with those contained in the declarations and principles approved by the United Nations or the Organization of American States ( PDDH Act , art .  2 ) .  
It keeps the statistical records of complaints received , the types of human rights violated , the acts of violation and those alleged to be responsible for the violations , whether at the national level or for each of the departments in which there are area offices .

Reaffirms the particular importance of the right of the child to education and the goals of Education for All , emphasizing the need for governments to broaden and constantly redefine the scope of basic education , including early childhood care and initial education , to develop a supporting policy context and to mobilize existing and new financial and human resources , including through concerted international action and cooperation ; 37 .  Calls upon States :  
The need for greater understanding of the genesis of conflicts was stressed , and while it was recognized that unique circumstances might differentiate conflicts , certain causes dearth of visionary leadership ; absence of good governance , especially transparency and accountability ; neglect of human rights ; pervasive poverty ; inequitable distribution of wealth and resources ; and social and cultural exclusion which breeds ethnic clashes are common to all .  
This will lead to the design of policy packages aimed at increasing physical and human capacities , taking into account the administrative requirements of such packages , sustainability concerns related to expanded production , the social and human context of polices related to international trade , and complementary measures .  The generation and optimal use of domestic finance for commodity-based development will also be part of these packages .  
To replace operative paragraph 3 by the following text , to be included in operative paragraph 2 as a new item ( i ) : ' The full promotion of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as the right to development ; ' .  
The Commission welcomes the reduction in the number of human rights violations attributed to the armed and security forces and the police , but is concerned that the armed forces have not fulfilled their intention to suspend from active service all those in their ranks who are under formal juridical or disciplinary investigation for human rights violations until guilt or innocence is determined and to dismiss them where such allegations have been proven .  
It urges the Government of Colombia to establish as soon as possible the necessary measures to guarantee a truly independent judicial system , to ensure the transfer of all judicial procedures concerning serious human rights violations currently under military penal jurisdiction to the jurisdiction of the ordinary justice system and to separate the functions of the executive and the judiciary .  
Gravely concerned by such recent outrages as the murder of three human rights defenders and mass abduction from an aircraft , for which guerrilla groups were responsible , it calls on the guerrilla groups to respect norms of international humanitarian law , especially to refrain from killings and all attacks on the civilian population , indiscriminate massacres , hostage _ taking and the widespread use of anti _ personnel landmines , and to fulfil their own pledges not to recruit children .  
The Commission expresses its profound concern over the grave situation of attacks against human rights defenders and deplores the lack of effective judicial investigations into such crimes as well as the absence of effective legal , administrative , security and financial measures to protect those social and human rights defenders who find themselves at risk .  
EU considers these positive developments as a solid basis for a stable process of change of Indonesia 's political , economic and social system leading to a civic society based on democratic principles , the rule of law and internationally accepted human rights standards .  
She extended her congratulations to the new members elected at the tenth meeting of States parties , stating that they had joined the human rights treaty body responsible for promoting and defending the rights of half of humanity .  
The Committee reaffirms that the Convention recognizes that womens rights include civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and that they are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights .  
The Committee is concerned that there is currently before Congress a bill to decriminalize domestic violence at both the civil and criminal level , passing responsibility for dealing with these human rights violations to an administrative court .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and effective criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and effective criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
At their tenth meeting , in September 1998 , the persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies reiterated their view that it was desirable to strive for focused periodic reports that would examine a limited range of issues that might be identified by the relevant treaty body in advance of the preparation of the report .  
The general human rights climate has also been worsened by the accompanying wave of protests and demonstrations , some of them violent and destructive of private property , and by the heightened sense of insecurity springing from an increase in threats and acts of intimidation , and by the spates of armed crime , acts of violence and assassinations or attempted assassinations , some of them possibly politically motivated .  
UNDP resident representatives have played a key role in telling the complex story of sustainable human development to help to increase understanding of what UNDP stands for and to generate support for the organization .  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all . 
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
With respect to the general framework within which human rights are protected and promoted , the Committee considers an independent judiciary to be an essential instrument for the protection of economic , social and cultural rights and therefore requests that information be included on the matter in the third periodic report .  
In this connection , the Special Rapporteur received consistent information that the Government of the Sudan is providing arms and ammunition to paramilitary groups such as the Murahaleen which are commonly held responsible for gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
He received well _ documented information , often from first-hand sources , pointing to the perpetration of massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict in southern Sudan , of which innocent civilians constitute the principle target and the famine is one of the direct by-products , in the context of which food is manipulated as a weapon of war .  
International cooperation in building major facilities is most effective when the project draws on the complementary capabilities of different nations , or when the project would be too expensive for individual nations to afford or if the international cooperative initiative itself represents a major challenge for human beings to achieve a particular goal .  
The model selected will constitute a missing element in the range of tools available at present to the astrophysical community for the exploration of the universe , extending from the near solar environment to the far distant phases of evolution , when the basic building blocks of human life were being created .  
At the international level , a main objective of development assistance should be to support national efforts for sustained human capital formation .  
Annual meetings during which all the major problems of society are discussed , with very structured progressive legal proposals ( many of which served as the basis for national legislative systems ) : the right of women to equality in all fields , not out of a rather empty feminism but out of simple respect for human rights . 
Despite the recommendations to the Colombian Government to dismantle the system of regional justice and faceless judges , efforts are being made to extend this system so as to continue unfair trials of workers , those who fight for the people , defenders of human rights and political opponents ; simply voicing an opinion that differs from the establishment view is cause enough for being put on trial .  This is tantamount to making social and popular protest a criminal offence .  
We are deeply concerned at the situation of human rights in Mexico , where the same methods are being applied as were used in our country , like the establishment of paramilitary groups , selective assassination and the extermination of civic and popular leaders of the indigenous and peasant communities .  
It was stated that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources , and continued strong political commitment were crucial .  
Reaffirmation of the importance attached to the work of IAEA regarding multilateral technical cooperation in the development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and call again for every effort to be made to ensure that IAEA has the necessary financial and human resources to meet its responsibilities in the area of technical cooperation , safeguards and nuclear safety .

A steering committee , comprised mainly of human resource specialists drawn from several organizations of the United Nations system , supervised the pilot , which was conducted , in close consultation with UNDG and CCPOQ , by a specialized firm selected on the basis of competitive bidding . 
A common theme in each report is the need for a comprehensive approach , elaborated jointly with national authorities , other United Nations agencies , the Bretton Woods institutions and major donors , and linking the political , humanitarian , human rights and development concerns .  
Firm-level technological development depends on external factors such as interaction with the local economic environment , which provides the human and financial resources needed for the cultivation of internal capability and essential services such as standard setting , testing , basic R &amp; amp ; D and other forms of institutional support that enable firms to conduct in-house technical work effectively . 
Indeed , it has now become common practice for the leadership in Addis Ababa to flagrantly violate fundamental principles of international law - whether it is in acts of brazen aggression , human rights violations or blatant incursions against neighbouring countries - and then accuse its victims for the very transgressions that it is guilty of in a pre-emptive , if transparent , manner . 
For the information of the Sub-Commission , the secretariat has also prepared ( annex II ) a list of country situations currently being considered by the Commission under the agenda items entitled Organization of the work of the session , The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and Advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights . the occupied Arab territories ,  
Accounts received by the High Commissioner and OHCHR staff in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Albania and Montenegro ( Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) provide substantial evidence of gross human rights violations which have been committed in Kosovo , including summary executions , forcible displacement , rape , physical abuse , and the destruction of property and identity documents .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
Consistency with current international law requires that the child be defined as every human being below the age of eighteen years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier ( article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) ) .  
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
Finally , some delegations pointed out that the main constraints to the effective and expanded application of TCDC / ECDC remain the lack of clearly defined national TCDC policies , insufficient awareness of TCDC 's full potential and importance , and inadequate provision of human and financial resources for TCDC .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
Although there was a drop in the number of reported cases of gross human rights violations during March , escapees from rebel-held territories continued to provide disturbing accounts of abusive rebel behaviour against civilians , including physical and psychological torture and harassment .  
Among the core principles of the Africa Partnership are : national commitment and ownership ; political action ; joint national strategic action plans ; mobilization of increased resources ; stronger regional technical platforms for action ; protection of human rights ; compassion and solidarity .  
In conclusion , the Committees proposal for an additional regular session to be held in New York is driven by a commitment to the interdependence and indivisibility of all rights , as well as a recognition of the renewed interest in economic , social and cultural rights which is evident in the work of the United Nations human rights system .  
In its resolution 1997 / 36 , of 28 August 1997 , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities authorized Ms . Clemencia Forero Ucros to prepare a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , for submission to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
Hence , the intractable problems and legal dilemmas posed by the human rights notions and pretexts invoked by the opposing sides engaged in this vicious circle of controversial aims and doubtful means .  
While they may mean different things to different people , 29 / depending on their philosophical , ideological , political , cultural , social and economic perspectives , all agree that the expression a democratic society referred to in the Universal Declaration and in both International Covenants 30 / is a vital concept for human rights based on common values shared by human beings throughout the world community .  
Proceeding from these ideas , it is assumed that a democratic society requires the existence and free exercise of certain basic individual and group rights and freedoms , which the Universal Declaration and the International Covenants - not to mention at this juncture other international , regional and national human rights instruments , norms and standards - define and thereby indicate their limits .  
A democratic society , moreover , whatever may be the cultural , political , social and economic framework in which it is achieved , is identified by certain principles and institutions , such as pluralism , the rule of law , legitimacy , political equality , popular control and public accountability of government , which , again , have their starting point in human rights and freedoms .  
Believing that youth concerns should be dealt with using an integrated approach which should allow young people , who are designated key partners for the achievement of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in paragraphs 182 ( n ) , 120 ( a ) and 120 ( b ) of the Habitat Agenda , 1 to participate fully on local , national , regional and international levels ,  
While pointing out that peace was a prerequisite for development , a number of delegations stated that , in recent years , armed conflict had exacted and was continuing to exact a heavy toll on human settlements and human settlements development and several called on the Centre to provide reconstruction assistance to countries and regions afflicted by armed conflict and natural and man-made disasters .  
Many delegations cited specific examples of how local authorities and non-governmental organizations were being strengthened and actively involved in policies and programmes to achieve adequate shelter and sustainable development of human settlements in their respective countries .  
The Commission has been blocked by a procedural decision , without even the recourse to any substantive explanation as to why it should not be allowed or , to be more precise , why it is not desirable for Habitat to mobilize the efforts of the international community and to develop measures to rebuild the ruined human settlements within Yugoslavia , which is what is called for in the Russian draft resolution .  
Finally , some delegations pointed out that the main constraints to the effective and expanded application of TCDC / ECDC remain the lack of clearly defined national TCDC policies , insufficient awareness of TCDC 's full potential and importance , and inadequate provision of human and financial resources for TCDC .  
A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .  
It is essential to fight for respect of human rights and norms of international humanitarian law , but solely through political and legal methods on the firm basis of the United Nations Charter and the relevant multilateral instruments .  
It is neither new nor extraordinary for the Commission on Human Rights to be manipulated , but it is serious that that Commission has not stated that the aerial campaign is a massive , flagrant , delirious and systematic violation of human rights .  
It is in this framework and with these purposes in mind that Hungary expresses its strong desire to live side by side with a democratic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at peace with its ethnic communities , respectful of all human rights , including the rights of national minorities , and thus ready to rejoin the community of nations .  
Albania highly appreciates the irreplaceable role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , which stopped one of the greatest human catastrophes in Europe after the Second World War and which brought to a halt the genocide and the ethnic cleansing carried out against millions of innocent Albanian civilians in the heart of Europe , thereby protecting the best values of our world civilization .  
This political solution should be followed by specific steps towards the establishment of the structures necessary for a civilian administration , economic rebuilding and development , democratic institutions and the rule of law , as well as security and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms for all , regardless of ethnic background or religious affiliation .  
While Mexico shares the outrage of the international community over the abuses of basic human , family and community rights , it has stated that the use of force , even inspired by the most noble humanitarian cause , leads to more violence and is hardly conducive to a lasting solution to problems .  
The discussions between high-level panellists and the audience , both of whom are composed of representatives of member States , local and regional NGOs , academics and opinion leaders , will focus on the main areas of the United Nations , including its role in the areas of peace and security , economic and social development cooperation , humanitarian relief and human rights .  
The crisis in Kosovo has resulted in the mass forced displacement and deportation of hundreds of thousands of civilians , wholesale destruction of property and means of livelihood , wanton lawlessness and violence , thousands of documented killings , countless as-yet undocumented deaths , and immeasurable human suffering .  
Refugees who have arrived in neighbouring countries have given consistent accounts of civilians being subjected to systematic and extreme human rights violations by security forces , of executions , of forced eviction from their homes , deportations , arbitrary detention , acts of sexual violence and burning of homes .  
Projects aimed at the strengthening of macroeconomic management capacity , legislative systems , the legal framework , the judiciary , civilian police and election management capacity , along with mechanisms for political reconciliation , public administration and civil service reform , inter alia , must be explored , particularly in Kosovo , taking advantage of national human resources , experience and skills .  
In addition to the human costs of the conflict , evidenced notably by numerous civilian casualties , the destruction of major industries by the air bombardment , as well as damage caused to infrastructure and essential services such as water and electricity supply , health services , education , communications , heating , the damage to land and river transportation links and the loss of trade , have caused tremendous economic and social hardship for the civilian populations . 
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ( author 's emphasis ) . 
As a result of the compromise reached , Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations defines one of the Organization 's purposes as being to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
All of this demonstrates that human rights have become a matter of international legal regulation and international protection , and the individual is considered to be a subject of international law with a clearly defined legal personality .  
Considering further that the States Members of the United Nations , by adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , reaffirmed their commitment to the observance of fundamental human rights , their faith in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women , and their determination to promote , in cooperation with the United Nations , the universal observance of civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights ,  
An entire new cluster of WHO technical programmes has also been established to promote health in the context of sustainable human development , including a renewed emphasis on reducing malnutrition and improving management of environmental risks to human health , integrating health dimensions into poverty reduction programmes and protecting vulnerable populations in situations of crisis and post-crisis ; promoting the synergy between health and human rights constitutes an additional priority .  
Improved coordination among the national and international institutions charged with developing and encouraging the adoption of policies and measures to meet human needs , without undermining the environmental foundation for development ;  
The studies carried out in those areas have all contributed to a better understanding of the real conditions prevailing in the country and have led to the adoption of better focused development plans and strategies , which in turn have improved the management of physical , human and financial resources and have guaranteed their rational use , while also yielding a corresponding increase in productivity .  
There is a real threat that it may become an epoch in which the unmitigated promotion of increased international trade , investment and finance at the expense of the observance and protection of fundamental human rights and sustainable human development ( SHD ) is adopted as a mantra guiding many Governments and development economists as was amply demonstrated in the MAI process .  
The issue under discussion involves both conceptual as well as empirical dimensions , some of which are already under consideration by the Sub _ Commission and the Commission on Human Rights . 17 / It also involves both categories of human rights , viz . , the civil and political , and the economic , social and cultural . 
A major success of the Decade has been a widespread acceptance of the fact that the growing risk of disasters associated with natural hazards , frequently compounded by uncontrolled or adverse human practices , must be mitigated .  
Banking and financial institutions , international technical assistance organizations and the specialized abilities of various United Nations agencies all have a role to play in ensuring that human , technical and material resources are wisely directed to sustained programmes of applied disaster mitigation practices .  
In industrialized countries too , with an increasing interdependency between information , complex technological facilities , human systems and hazards , there is now the potential for catastrophic failures on a global basis , as the example of the year 2000 computer problem has demonstrated .  
Equally , the relationship between human behaviour and biomedical risks has also become more evident , exacerbated by the ease of rapid international transmission of public health and environmental health hazards , including food contamination , as seen for instance in the dramatic spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) throughout the world .  
By resolution 8 ( XXIII ) of 16 March 1967 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to give annual consideration to the item entitled Question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including policies of racial discrimination and segregation and of apartheid , in all countries , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 20 _ 21 and 29 _ 37 above ) . 
At its forty _ fifth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its resolution 1993 / 40 , decided to entrust Mr . Asbjrn Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels , taking also into account matters related to the realization of the right to development .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
At its forty _ ninth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1997 / 107 taking note that it did not have sufficient time for a comprehensive discussion of the final report of the Special Rapporteur on income distribution and human rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 9 ) , decided to postpone to its fiftieth session the presentation by Mr . Bengoa of his final report and to request him to complete his report by preparing a supplementary document on this issue .  
In addition , it decided to appoint Mrs . Mara Concepcin Bautista to prepare a report on the application of international standards concerning the human rights of detained juveniles , in particular the separation of juvenile and adult offenders in penal institutions , detention pending trial , least possible use of institutionalization and the objectives of institutional treatment .  
At its fiftieth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1998 / 112 , decided to continue consideration of the adverse consequences of economic sanctions on human rights at its fifty _ first session under the agenda sub _ item entitled Implications of humanitarian activities for the enjoyment of human rights .  
At its forty _ fourth session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its decision 1998 / 107 , decided to approve the appointment of Mrs . Koufa as Special Rapporteur to conduct a comprehensive study on terrorism and human rights on the basis of her working paper , and to request the Special Rapporteur to submit her preliminary report to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session , a progress report at its fifty _ first session and a final report at its fifty _ second session .  
Their primary objective should be to seek , through their presence and contacts with the local authorities , to promote respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deter massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the future .  
In response to reports of summary executions of non-combatants , including women and children , in their homes , arbitrary detentions , forced displacement , use of forced labour and burning of homes and property in the central highlands of Hazarajat , the Special Rapporteur visited Quetta , Pakistan , on 22 May where he met refugees who provided credible eye-witness accounts of gross violations of human rights during March , April and May 1999 . 
The chronic fighting and the resultant political uncertainty has exacerbated the human misery of innocent Afghan people , who have already suffered for too long and are the real victims of this endless war .  
Particular consideration should be given , in these cases , to the practical day-to-day consequences ( sometimes grave ) of the lack of such agreements for the juridical and political status of the peoples concerned in the mixed societies in which they now live , and for the preservation , promotion and effective realization of their historical rights as peoples , including their human rights and freedoms . 
Nor is it by chance that the Commission , on the very date on which it established the Special Rapporteurs mandate , recognized ( in impeccable diplomatic parlance ) that in various situations , indigenous peoples are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms ( Commission resolution 1989 / 34 of 6 March 1989 , sixth preambular paragraph ) .  
As far as his mandate is concerned , it must be recalled that the main purpose of the study is to analyse the potential utility of treaties , agreements and other constructive arrangements between indigenous peoples and Governments for the purpose of ensuring the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those peoples .  
As stated in the Secretary-Generals report on human resources management ( A / 53 / 342 , para . 52 ) , the Organizations career development policy is based on the principle that responsibility for career growth and development is shared : by the Organization , which must provide structural support and a framework of opportunities ; by managers , who must support their staffs development and career progress ; and by the staff members themselves , who must be committed to continuous professional growth .  
The overall goals of life science observation was therefore to use the unique environment of space flight to study the response of the human organism to specific stresses , to increase understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the neuroendocrine , developmental and behavioural changes that occur in space flight , to obtain new data to enhance human space flight and to apply the results of space research for the health , well-being and economic benefit of people on Earth .  
They constituted steps in a process towards a better understanding of the relationship between human rights and development , and a recognition that economic and social rights are as indispensable as civil and political rights .  
To promote optimal allocation and use of public and private investments to foster human resources , sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries and forestry systems , and rural development , in high and low potential areas ;  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all .  
It sets out the normative content of the human right to adequate food , the corresponding obligations including State obligations at the national level and at the international level , the responsibilities of international organizations , and regulation of economic enterprises and other actors .  
It is also inseparable from social justice , requiring the adoption of appropriate economic , environmental and social policies , at both the national and international levels , oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all .  
The orthodox view of exhaustion of local remedies was the procedural view , namely , that the wrong might have occurred but no international action could be taken by way of a diplomatic claim or human rights complaint prior to the exhaustion of local remedies .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the document entitled " White paper on massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) and their Congolese accomplices in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo : Volume II " , covering the period from 6 November 1998 to 15 April 1999 ( see annex ) .  
In the first volume of the white paper , the Ministry of Human Rights concentrated on the massive violations of human rights and of the basic rules of international humanitarian law by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
As part of an effort to make both national and international public opinion aware of the massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards , the Government of National Salvation , through the Ministry of Human Rights , has taken the initiative of issuing periodic publications which provide a summary account of the conduct of the aggressor States of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
A number of functional commissions did not concur with proposals , contained , inter alia , in the 1998 consolidated report ( E / 1999 / 3 ) that certain topics , such as gender equality and human rights , should be addressed exclusively by the single functional commission which has the primary responsibility for the subject matter , in particular in the context of implementation and follow-up to a major conference .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  6 .  The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
This revolution is aimed at developing the country 's human resources by ensuring that the education system is relevant and geared to equip students with the requisite knowledge , skills and abilities for sustained , successful living in the twenty-first century .  
Within the framework of respect for human rights and strengthening democracy , the Bolivian State intends to continue seeking alternative models for dealing with sexual and reproductive health within the context of the social , economic , political and cultural factors that come into play in health matters .  
A strategy has been implemented on the basis of the principles of sustainable human development , the continued growth in acquiring new knowledge , culture , the spirit of invention and popular participation through the establishment of an organized , stable and strong society with transparent and efficient institutions .  
The implementation of this strategy has yielded tangible progress in understanding the situation of our population , which is indispensable for adjusting demographic trends and certain social behaviours that are not conducive to sustainable human development .  
In a globalizing world , island nations such as ours , with limited natural resources and human capital , urgently need the support and assistance of the international community in overcoming our inherent vulnerabilities and realizing the hopes and aspirations of our peoples for achieving lasting and meaningful development .  
It is aimed at addressing a range of interrelated challenges , protecting individual social and economic rights and human rights in general , providing legal protections and creating conditions to protect the cultural , spiritual and intellectual interests of our people .  
Quality of life is determined not simply by material goods , but is made up of a whole set of simultaneously interwoven factors : health , education , employment , elimination of poverty , respect of human rights , the possibility of self-fulfilment , social and cultural integration and living in an ecologically enlightened environment .  
We are also committed to developing cooperation with countries of origin , but we believe that a constructive approach to international migration implies first and foremost the protection of the human rights and dignity of all migrants , irrespective of their legal status , including through the adoption and enforcement of legal instruments , both national and international . 
In Libya , development is based on improving the quality of life through democratic institutions built on popular participation , the rule of law and full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , by increasing economic opportunities and aiming for equality and fairness between the sexes .  
The objectives of this programme have focused on bettering the standard of living , diversifying the structure of the national economy and the sources of revenue , on social equity , a balanced development , and the development and evolution of human resources .  
From our point of view , the crisis in the Balkans should encourage the international community to seek a better understanding of the extreme importance of joint activities , within the framework of decisions taken by United Nations bodies , towards the settlement of ethnic conflicts by peaceful means in order to maintain peace , protect human rights and provide an opportunity to every person for the unhampered achievement of his or her human and spiritual potential .  
This plan revolves around seven priority areas : first , improvement of the living conditions of women ; second , improvement of the legal status of women ; third , development of female human resources in all the development sectors ; fourth , access by women to effective decision-making ; fifth , promotion and protection of the girl child ; sixth , combatting violence against women ; and seventh , improvement of the institutional framework .  
In this respect , a negative role is played by , among other factors , the country 's particular economic structure inherited from the former Soviet Union , which is incapable of meeting the requirements of a market economy ; Tajikistan 's geographic remoteness , which has a significant detrimental effect on external economic activity ; and mountainous terrain that makes a mere 7 per cent of our country suitable for human settlement .  
These include ( a ) strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing distortions so as to encourage private sector investment ; ( b ) improving the quality of government spending in order to invest in basic social services and raise the level of human capital ; and ( c ) rationalizing the assistance provided by external donors .  
The view was expressed that the decision on ratification as well as on rationalization and adaptation of the human rights machinery at the national level was the prerogative of individual sovereign countries rather than an initiative taken by the departments concerned .  
In this context of violence and cruelty , the Special Rapporteur wishes to note that regardless of the atrocities committed and the bleak and inhuman atmosphere described in numerous accounts and testimonies , there have been some remarkable acts of integrity , courage and compassion on the part of persons who at great personal risk have attempted to assist or rescue victims of human rights abuses .  
Given the limited nature of UNHCRs involvement in Colombia , it is recognized that UNHCRs support will only be effective if linked to broader efforts to uphold international humanitarian law and to strengthen respect for human rights , within the context of a common approach with other United Nations partners .  
Initiated in January 1998 , this process was broadened over the course of the last year to engage a wide range of non-state actors - - including major human rights and humanitarian NGOs , United Nations sister agencies and the corporate sector - - in a series of dialogues on the nature and dimensions of the current protection challenges ; where the main problems lie ; and what States and organizations might do together with UNHCR to ensure improved and sustained support for protection principles .  
Similarly , the ILO / UNESCO recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers states in its Guiding Principles that education from the earliest school years should be directed to the all _ round development of the human personality and to the spiritual , moral , social , cultural and economic progress of the community , as well as to the inculcation of deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the ability of every person to become a useful member of society , the promotion of understanding , tolerance and friendship among all nations , all racial , ethnic and religious groups are at once the origin , condition and consequence of education aimed at personal development and based on the higher interests of the person educated : 
These needs comprise both essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions and to continue learning ( art . 1 , para . 
There must be no misunderstanding : here we are dealing with apparently simple principles which require those involved in education to strike out in genuinely new directions , either in order to take a concept of education that is still too narrow and individualistic and open it up to universal values or in order to take an education that is too universalist or ideological and refocus it on the human person .  
Without success in this area it is hardly possible to create the stable , just and democratic political environment which in turn is an indispensable precondition for sustainable human , economic and social development .  
Mechanisms were also to foster national reconciliation , such as the Truth Commission , whose mandate was to shed light on the most relevant cases of human rights violations , the ad hoc committee responsible for purging the armed forces and the Peace Commission ( COPAZ ) , which was responsible for safeguarding and ensuring compliance with commitments undertaken to promote assistance and community development , mainly in the agricultural sector .  
In exercising their functions , all persons undertaking public duties or holding public office in Kosovo will be required to observe internationally recognized human rights standards , and shall not discriminate against any person on any grounds , such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , association with a national community , property , birth or other status .  
It had been urged that it was imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights .  
The improvement of the overall human rights situation would require the emergence of a framework for building peace through an inclusive participatory process involving continuing consultations with all segments of the Afghan people , aimed at establishing a broad _ based , multi _ ethnic and fully representative government .  
Paragraph 1 does not apply to international obligations which are expressed or intended to be obligations of total restraint even for States engaged in armed conflict or acting in self-defence , and in particular to obligations of a humanitarian character relating to the protection of the human person in time of armed conflict or national emergency . 
Within the Palestinian Police Force , UNHCHR has established a cadre of qualified human rights and law enforcement peer trainers and intends to work further with such trainers , through advanced training fellowships and technical assistance , to develop an institutionalized code of conduct and standing orders consistent with international human rights standards .  
The Council expresses its concern , in the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Geneva Conventions , about the continuous erosion , in many cases , in the respect for international humanitarian and human rights law and principles , both in terms of denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need and through deliberate violence against all those protected under international humanitarian law , especially women and children .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
_ that free legal and other assistance is provided to trafficked persons and persons in prostitution in the course of any criminal , civil and other action against traffickers and those who violate the human rights of trafficked persons and persons in prostitution , including a temporary or permanent residence permit and a safe shelter ;  
In view of these circumstances , and seeking to gather more information on all aspects of the question of remote interpretation in the technical , financial and human resources fields , it has been provisionally decided to organize another experiment , as comprehensive as the one conducted earlier this year , but now entailing the servicing from Geneva of a two-week meeting to be held at Nairobi as early as possible in 2000 .  
That the proposed Decade was both a moral imperative and an opportunity for the world community , in a spirit of global cooperation , to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to alleviate human suffering and enhance economic security ;  
The African continent is subject to a wide range of natural hazards , and suffers constantly from natural and other disasters , which have serious adverse effects on societies and national economies as well as on scarce human and material resources .  
Given the lack of educated and trained manpower , international efforts are required to ensure that sufficient opportunities are available to developing countries to build their human resource base in different areas of space technology and its applications ;  
On that basis , the majority of Libyan legislative acts promulgated after the Great Revolution of 1 September are directed at all citizens , irrespective of gender ; they prescribe numerous rights to be enjoyed in all fields , without distinction between men and women , in so far as they are fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , both male and female .  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term " discrimination against women " shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
Most Libyan legislative acts are directed at all citizens , irrespective of their sex , and prescribe the body of rights which they enjoy in the political , functional , economic , social , cultural , health and educational fields , without discrimination between men and women , being fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , whether male or female .  
Globalization , diversification of forms of migration , the declining role of State leadership in migration , decrease of State _ organized migration as compared to spontaneous migration , increase in temporary migration , growth of private recruitment agencies , increase in irregular migration , trade in human beings and - what is very important - feminization of migration have substantially changed the context of contemporary migration .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
The European Union commends the efforts of OAU and all those who have supported it in its search for a peaceful solution to the conflict , which has caused enormous human and physical losses in Ethiopia and Eritrea , jeopardizes political and economic stability in the two countries and in the region , and undermines their capacity to attract foreign support needed for their development .  
Consolidate democracy through the promotion of pluralism , the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , maximizing the participation of citizens in decision-making and the development of competent public institutions , including an independent judiciary , responsible legislature and public service and an electoral system that ensures free and fair elections .  
Recognizing that the world was stepping into the twenty-first century with the burden of many unresolved conflicts and stalemated peace processes , the meeting stressed that those conflicts posed a threat to peace and drained the scarce resources of the world , which were urgently required for the development and prosperity of the human race .  
Apart from training of developing human resources at the basic level of science and technology and fostering South-South cooperation , the regional centres for space science and technology education and relevant existing national institutions should organize specific training programmes to contribute to the building of regional and local expertise and ultimately to the success of know-how and technology transfer programmes .  
The NGO community , which has contributed enormously to strengthening the human rights regime , especially regarding civil and political rights , is now moving enthusiastically to operate at the grass _ roots level to deliver economic , social and cultural rights .  
The adoption by the United Nations in 1986 of the Declaration on the Right to Development was the culmination of a long process of international deliberation on human rights which were perceived from the very beginning as an integrated whole of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
After that , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 clearly recognized the unity of all those rights and elaborated the theme , as noted later in the preamble to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that , the ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights , as well as his economic , social and cultural rights .  
As early as 1968 , the Proclamation of Tehran stated : since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible .  
In 1969 the Declaration on Social Progress and Development further emphasized the interdependence of these two sets of rights , and by the early 1970s the concept of the right to development emerged as a human right that unified in itself the civil and political rights as well as the economic , social and cultural rights .  
The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Similarly , the recommendation regarding the civil society and non-governmental organizations , encouraging their greater participation , especially of those groups that represent the vulnerable sections , such as the poor , the homeless and the unemployed , and the public interest ( e.g . consumer , environmental , human rights and women 's organizations ) , in the local and national decision-making , would be equally important .  
As mentioned above , in most situations of realizing human rights in a particular country , there is so much waste and inefficient use of domestic resources that substantial progress can be made in improving the realization of most human rights even within the existing resources , which can be augmented by international cooperation for which a call has been given explicitly in the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
It states : The right to Development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
Then , there is a process of economic , social , cultural and political development , which is recognized as one in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
To appreciate fully the emphasis the Declaration puts on international cooperation , article 4 should be read in conjunction with the opening sentence of the preamble to the Declaration which refers to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations relating to the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural and humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The importance of the last element derives from the fact that the right to development is a human right , and as such it is interdependent and indivisible with other civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in the sense that the denial of any one of these rights would tend to deny the right to development itself .  
Most importantly , as constituent components of human rights , these rights have to be achieved following the human rights approach , with full respect for civil and political rights and , with the effective participation of all concerned , equal opportunity of access and fair distribution of the benefits of development .  
The academic community has assisted the United Nations human rights machinery by , among other things , developing two sets of guidelines known as the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( 1986 ) , elaborated in 1997 in the Maastricht guidelines on violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Independent national human rights institutions , acting in accordance with the 1991 Paris Principles , play an important role in the realization of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , as was stressed by the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No . 10 ( 1998 ) .  
While further developing close cooperation with regional human rights organizations , the Office intends , therefore , to intensify its programme of cooperation at the regional and subregional level , a significant portion of which will focus on economic , social and cultural rights .  
The debt overhang , inadequate external finance - exemplified by the decline in ODA - limited market access for exports , severe supply-side constraints , deterioration in human welfare and the increasing number of humanitarian and natural disasters have adversely impacted on the economic performance of LDCs . 
While the Committee is aware that the full implementation of the new juvenile justice system requires substantial financial and human resources as well as the development of infrastructure , as established in the document entitled Transformation and investment in the human rights of children and adolescents ( May 1999 ) , it remains concerned that the juvenile justice system is not fully implemented .  
A large number of non-governmental organizations - international , foreign and domestic - work in Uganda in areas related to the right to education ( such as social development , literacy , special education , gender , human rights ) but few explicitly address that right , thus exacerbating the paucity of conceptual and analytical work necessary for its promotion and protection .  
This is particularly visible with regard to the eradication of poverty , which needs a human rights underpinning , as well as concerning economic , social and cultural rights for which operationalization wavers between an unrealistic expectation that the Government will provide necessary services to all free of charge , and surrender in the face of the combined obstacles of poverty and debt servicing . 
Although the growing influence of bilateral donors and conditionalities attached to their aid for education have increased the Governments budgetary allocation for primary education , this influence has not encompassed facilitating a translation of Ugandas human rights obligations - including those concerning primary education - into recognized and enforceable rights .  
They noted the multifaceted nature of the concept , which combines political , ideological , economic , social , cultural and ethical criteria , and identified its main elements , such as transparency in public administration , accountability , respect for human rights and legality , promotion of democracy and enhanced management of resources . 
Ensure that United Nations missions aimed at peace-making , peacekeeping and peace-building include a mass media component that can disseminate information about international humanitarian law and human rights law , including peace education and children 's protection , while also giving objective information about the activities of the United Nations , and encourage authorized regional missions to include such a capacity .  
Underscore the importance of compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law in the conduct of all peacekeeping operations by urging that Member States disseminate instructions among their personnel serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations and among those participating in authorized operations conducted under national or regional command and control .  
Holy See suggested the following text : Full respect for human dignity , human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as the various religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds , philosophical convictions of its people , and peace and security , are also crucial for social development . 
The main objectives of the initiative were to strengthen mutual confidence and understanding between UNDP and the specialized agencies through annual consultations and improved information exchange ; to work together more effectively in support of national development priorities and Member States goals through joint strategies , research and resource mobilization ; to improve management and achieve economies of scale through pooling of networks and human resources ; and to review existing tools .  
The BSEC Charters preamble reaffirms the common will of its member States to adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter and share the vision of their regional cooperation as part of the integration process in Europe , based on human rights and fundamental freedoms , prosperity through economic liberty , social justice , and equal security and stability , which is open for interaction with other countries , regional initiatives and international organizations and financial institutions .  
This cooperation is not confined to official endeavours undertaken by the Kuwaiti Government ; the State is also encouraging national institutions and individuals to provide aid and assistance to those in need thereof in other countries , regardless of the origin or cause of that need which might be attributable to poverty , natural disasters , human conflicts or other causes of human suffering which the State of Kuwait is endeavouring to combat and alleviate .  
From my perspective the basic premise upon which the CD is established is the conviction that measures to promote and achieve non _ proliferation , arms control and disarmament are vital dimensions of a complex and comprehensive effort to enhance international security between sovereign States and to secure human security for all . 
An indigenous representative from Manipur in India said that recent developments in India indicated that existing domestic and international mechanisms to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples , including children , and to conserve vital wetlands and sensitive eco-zones of spiritual value had failed to fulfil their objectives , despite strong efforts by the indigenous peoples in Manipur to protect their human rights .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
" 17 .  UNCTAD , in cooperation with other relevant international organizations and within existing human and financial resources , should seek to assist developing countries , upon request , in understanding the implications of various legislative approaches to accommodating electronic commerce ; "  
The developing economies where 60 per cent of the worlds elderly now live , rising to 70 per cent in 20 years are challenged to develop human and economic capital while strengthening the social capital of family and community security systems .  
The four elements can be rendered dynamic by blending them with the idea of generating capital in four areas human , socio-cultural , economic and environmental in order to produce a proactive and wealth-creating approach to ageing , going beyond a mere reactive , or maintenance , stance .  
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
The Bureau 's report also appears to overlook the balances achieved in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , reaffirmed the universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated nature of human rights and the need for the international community to treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis .  The Bureau 's report , on the one hand , focuses mainly on promoting civil and political rights .  
As a result , the need to ensure the principle of the indivisibility of human rights by directly addressing the existing imbalance between civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other , appears to have been neglected .  
Similarly , the creation and establishment of a balanced human rights programme and the need to allocate adequate human and financial resources to capacity building , the right to development , economic , social and cultural rights , technical cooperation etc . , are also missing from the report .  Alternative recommendation 2 : To include the establishment of a balanced human rights programme on the agenda of the working group referred to above .  
According to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , international cooperation should be paramount in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
The success of the review of the mechanisms can best be judged by achieving such a balance through concrete proposals , such as assigning equal budgetary and human resources to both civil and political and to economic , social and cultural rights .  
What is therefore required is a developmental approach to human rights , keeping in mind that all human rights are indivisible and the need for adequate importance to be given to economic , social and cultural rights .  
Additionally , we would like to reiterate our suggestion contained in the previous written submission that the Working Group on Communications at its first meeting would be requested to ensure that 1503 submissions meet the following preconditions : ( a ) domestic remedies have been exhausted ; ( b ) the matter under consideration is demonstrably a gross and reliably attested violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; ( c ) the submissions are clearly devoid of politicization .  
Given the recognized and authentic relationship which exists between disarmament and development and because it is immoral and unacceptable to squander resources on armaments while the needs of billions of human beings so unsatisfied , the final document resulting from the first special session devoted to disarmament , held in 1978 , included various references to the question in its paragraphs 16 , 35 , 89 , 94 and 95 .  
Furthermore , our feelings of incredulity and indignation are accompanied by the conviction that many of the economic and social problems which overwhelm and cause distress to the majority of human beings could be alleviated in considerable measure if only a fraction of the resources devoted to military expenditures were utilized for the noble objective of the progress and well-being of the peoples of the world .  
In addition , the Office has developed a specific anti-trafficking programme whose objective is to work towards the integration of human rights into international , regional and national anti-trafficking initiatives , with emphasis on legal and policy development .  
A series of round tables , expert meetings and regional consultations have been organized on key issues , such as adolescent sexual and reproductive health ( New York , 1417 April 1998 ) and implementing reproductive rights and implementing sexual and reproductive health programmes , including womens empowerment , male involvement and human rights ( 2225 June 1998 ) .  
UNICEF has also widely disseminated a conceptual framework on UNICEFs human rights approach , a discussion paper on indicators for global monitoring of child rights , a paper on human rights for children and women , a series of animated child rights cartoons , and will release throughout 1999 a series of working papers compiling the relevant international standards in relation to children in armed conflict , girls , child labour and sexual exploitation .  
The focus on human rights standards is further reflected in the technical assistance provided to Governments and in the strengthening of the institutional and legal environment ; in the drafting of new constitutions ; the reform of civil and penal laws and the establishment or rehabilitation of juvenile courts .  
" The Sudan has witnessed important political and constitutional developments in the last 10 years , including the Peace Agreement , which includes the right to and self-determination for south Sudan , dialogue over national reconciliation , political pluralism , the positive developments in the country 's relations with its neighbours and the European Union and close cooperation with the United Nations in humanitarian issues and human rights .  
Canada believes that the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons ( hereinafter referred to as small arms ) have now been widely recognized as an important issue affecting international as well as human security , one that demands urgent action .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
The demand for small arms and light weapons is caused primarily by ethnic and religious conflict , economic and social exclusion , poor governance , lack of respect for the rule of law , lack of democratic institutions and lack of respect for human rights .  
My personal hope is that the projected dialogue of civilizations will eventuate at some future point in a formal statement on human values , not a charter or compact containing strictures that would be formally binding on its signatories , but a statement of fundamental human values that elaborates their bases in belief and thought as understood in different civilizational traditions .  
Moreover , the joint UNDP / UNCTAD Programme on Globalization , Liberalization and Sustainable Human Development , which was initiated in 1998 , supports the development of a conceptual and analytical framework articulating globalization and sustainable human development and the strengthening of the negotiation capacities of poor countries , to enable them to participate better in the negotiations of multilateral trade , investment and financial agreements .  
The international community , particularly the developed countries , collectively committed itself to a significant and substantial increase in supporting the efforts of the least developed countries to mobilize and develop their human capacities and the development of their economic base .  
The theme would include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bio-ethics , bio-safety , bio-diversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment . 
There can be no doubt that the atrocities committed against the civilian population of Sierra Leone , including widespread systematic killings , rapes and amputations , constitute massive violations of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
During 1997-1998 , projects have focused on : combating drugs , arms trafficking and organized crime ; assisting in mine clearance ; supporting regional integration and democratization ; increasing competence and institution building in public administration ; human resources development ; rehabilitation and development of the transport sector ; promotion of trade and investment ; improving land , water and energy resources management ; and HIV / AIDS prevention .  
According to the indictment , many of the detainees under the accused 's control were subjected to inhumane treatment , including excessive and cruel interrogation , physical and psychological harm , forced labour in hazardous conditions and being used as " human shields " , and some of the detainees were murdered or otherwise killed .  
With regard to the latter decision , the Trial Chamber stated that " [ international humanitarian law ] does not lay down synallagmatic obligations , i.e . obligations based on reciprocity , but obligations erga omnes ( or , in the case of treaty obligations , obligations erga omnes contractantes ) which are designed to safeguard fundamental human values and therefore must be complied with regardless of the conduct of the other party or parties . "  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing . 
If not , the Security Council will impress upon the world public that the United States Government has abused the United Nations name to protect KLA terrorists , to cover up mass human rights violations and make possible the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and Metohija , thus creating a state which is both illegal and untenable .  
We can not but sound the alarm regarding information on new gross violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including reports of mass shootings , arrests and forcible relocations of hundreds of thousands of peaceful inhabitants of Afghanistan .  
The project will lead to the development or harmonization of relevant legal instruments and to improved coordination among the concerned institutions and , based on an analysis of the institutional capacity to respond to that form of crime , will contribute to the development of a national strategy and elements of a subregional strategy against trafficking in human beings .  
It reads : To play a leading role in advancing comprehensive and sustainable human development through the enhanced participation of Jordanians , the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development strives to impact best development practices at the national level , drawing on its experience and local presence , while creating opportunities and expanding the choices of Jordanians to play a central role in the process of shaping the countrys future . 
Whether initiating or sponsoring research , training and education on the United Nations and United Nations reform , on the Great Lakes region of Africa , on early conflict warning and prevention , on disarmament , the status of women , racism and racial discrimination , human rights and sustainable development and environmental protection , WFUNA remains committed to examining the critical issues before the United Nations and to help find solutions that will shape our common future .  
Among the substantive issues discussed , the following warrant special note : identification of the items to be considered ; how to ensure observance of existing international standards ; activities to be undertaken ; appraisal of progress achieved and obstacles met in eliminating racism ; measures for making United Nations mechanisms more effective ; and , lastly , proposals for securing the necessary human and financial resources .  
The international community has repeatedly condemned the harmful impact of such measures on trade relations among States and on the full realization and enjoyment of human rights , in particular the right to enjoy a standard of living adequate for health and well-being , including food , health care , housing and basic social services , and the right to development .  
When the shell hits its target , normally a tank or an armoured car , it emits chemical and radioactive dust containing carcinogenic ionized atoms ( alpha-gamma ) that not only contaminates the area around the incinerated tank but is carried great distances on the wind and spread over a wide area , contaminating the air , soil , vegetation and human beings .  
Important related developments during the past year are presently reviewed , encompassing national electoral processes , public security , human rights , human development , the impact of Hurricane Mitch , regional and extraregional trade and cooperation , the role of regional and hemispheric institutions and bilateral issues .  
It is hoped that the crucial independence of this institution in the countries where it is present and of other institutions responsible for ensuring public accountability of government actions will be strengthened and protected so that they might perform their fundamental role of protecting human rights and as a pillar of citizen confidence in Government .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities among their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
The resulting Antigua Declaration , adopted on 11 March , recognizes the impact of Hurricane Mitch and , in supporting the reconstruction and transformation initiative , reaffirms shared values of democracy , the free market , respect for human rights and fundamental liberties , the rule of law , the struggle against international crime and a commitment to environmental protection .  
It is hoped that these institutions , in conjunction with the National Civil Police , the judiciary and other State institutions and government ministries responsible for public security , will provide an increasingly consolidated institutional framework for addressing criminal activity while guaranteeing permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law , in accordance with the spirit of the peace accords , and building upon the foundation of earlier achievements .  
The specific recommendations formulated by the Commission are directed at promoting the implementation of the peace accords , encouraging peace and national harmony in Guatemala and , in particular , preserving the memory of the victims , fostering a culture of mutual respect and observance of human rights and strengthening the democratic process .  
In this regard , it is also my profound hope that the alarming levels of social and criminal violence will continue to be addressed by Governments through strengthened civilian police , more efficient judicial systems , independent ombudsmen and permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law .  
The UNDP policy document entitled Integrating human rights with sustainable human development embraces a holistic vision integrating all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
A policy framework that integrates macroeconomic , financial , structural , social and human issues is imperative if there is to be equitable and sustainable development .  
Resources should be allocated to basic priority human concerns , for example , moving away from military towards social spending and shifting the focus to better education , health services and safe water accessible to people living with poverty .  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
This approach recognizes the inherent dignity of every human being without distinction ; recognizes and promotes equality between men and women ; promotes participation as a key principle for governance and development planning ; promotes equal opportunities and choices for all so that everyone can develop his or her own unique potential and have a chance to contribute to development and social progress .  
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
This group of nations with different traditions , cultures and historical experiences was brought together by a shared commitment to democracy and a belief that the promise of economic prosperity enjoyed by all citizens is more likely to be realized in a democratic political environment based on respect of human rights , popular participation and the rule of law . 
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
This silence is alarming inasmuch as there are situations in which a countrys press reports in abundant detail on the presence of companies involved in matters of national security and public safety without regard for human rights and in open contradiction with constitutional provisions that categorically state that internal order and security are the exclusive responsibility of the State .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
To close the income and technological gap between the region and the rest of the world requires a more comprehensive approach , including effective public and private investments in industrial infrastructure , strengthening of technological capabilities through human resource development , institution-building and effective economic governance .  
Member States are encouraged to continue supporting the efforts of the Office in this area and to provide additional financial resources as part of their contributions to the programme of advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights , to enable the Office to further extend its activities in support of Member States that request assistance in establishing national institutions and also to support such institutions in their work .  
Full realization of the rights of all peoples , including those living under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , to self-determination enshrined in the Charter and embodied in the international covenants on human rights , as well as in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 ( XV ) of 14 December 1960 ;  
GOOS aims to meet the need for : ( a ) forecasting climate variability and change ; ( b ) assessing the state of health of the marine environment and its resources ( including the coastal zone ) ; and ( c ) supporting an improved decision-making and management process which takes into account potential natural and man-made changes in the environment and their effects on human health and resources .  
Female infanticide was addressed in the Commissions resolution 1999 / 80 , on the rights of the child , with States being called upon to eliminate the root causes of son preference which resulted in harmful and unethical practices , and to eradicate traditional or customary practices , particularly female genital mutilation , that were harmful to women and girls and that violated their human rights .  
UNFPA continued to address harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage because of their impact on womens reproductive and sexual health and as violations of womens fundamental human rights .  
At the second Consultative Group Meeting for the Reconstruction and Transformation of Central America , co-hosted by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Government of Sweden and held in Stockholm , from 25 to 28 May 1999 , the Governments of the region , the principal donors and civil society representatives renewed their commitment to democratic change and sustainable human development as the best means of reducing social and ecological vulnerability to future disasters .  
Across the region , there are indications of a growing gap in human development between zones of relative affluence in the capitals and principal cities and the extreme poverty of marginalized rural and urban areas .  There are related patterns of social inequality and exclusion between social groups , reflected in regional data on distribution of income and access to employment , health and education .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities between their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
In Guatemala and Honduras , the Government of Sweden has approved multi-year governance programmes with UNDP worth over US $ 50-million , aimed at supporting the creation and strengthening of new democratic institutions , including human rights institutions , the courts , public defenders offices and other governmental and non-governmental institutions working for restoration of the rule of law , increased access to justice and respect for human rights .  
The specific recommendations formulated by the Commission are directed at encouraging peace and national harmony in Guatemala and , in particular , at preserving the memory of the victims , fostering the culture of mutual respect and observance of human rights and strengthening the democratic process .  
The representative further stated that it would be a great misfortune for the defenders of human rights if a precedent was set whereby any non-governmental organization involved in a technical-procedural error was to be punished unduly on the basis of one specific case .  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , and stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility ,  
The broad human rights approach to disability , therefore , takes the view of advancing the rights and well being of all people , regardless of disabilities , through promotion of implementation of general and disability-specific international instruments that encompass civil and political to economic , social and cultural rights for all .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
My Office is more than willing to play its part in implementing the report 's constructive recommendations on the effective implementation of international human rights , humanitarian and refugee law and on the prevention of gross violations of human right so crucial to national and regional stability and thus to international peace and security .  
This is true both because of the increased demand that we do something when gross and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law occur , and also because the new international security environment makes it more feasible to do so .  
In collecting information during the four visits for the preparation of the present report , meetings were held with a wide range of personalities from various sectors of Rwandan society : branches of the Government , civil society , members of diplomatic missions and members of United Nations agencies , as well as with some national and international non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) involved in human rights and related matters in Rwanda .  
The public round table is organized to facilitate a wide and rich exchange of experience and expertise from outstanding personalities invited from other similar , but older , national institutions charged with the function of protecting and promoting human rights .  
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .  
Distressed by the widespread violation of the principle of non-refoulement and of the rights of refugees and recalling that asylum applicants should have access to fair and expeditious status-determination procedures , the Assembly encouraged States that had not already done so to consider acceding to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and to other relevant refugee instruments , as applicable , and to relevant international human rights instruments .  
The United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone reported horrifying violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including the wilful killing and torture or inhuman treatment of persons taking no active part in the hostilities .  
She also condemned the grave human rights violations suffered by Serbs , Roma and others , expressing deep concern over the mass exodus of 150,000 Serbs from Kosovo , who join more than half a-million Serb refugees in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina enduring deprivation and an uncertain future in Serbia .  
The seminar produced guidelines that recognize that forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human rights and can only be carried out under exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with relevant provisions of international human rights law .  
The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) acts with its partners in the international community to assist in meeting the operational challenges of migration , advance understanding of migration issues , encourage social and economic development through migration , and uphold the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  IOM is involved in all phases of mass exoduses , providing technical and operational expertise in such areas as transportation , health , and other services for migrants .  
IRIN updates and alerts , covering a wide range of humanitarian , human rights , political , economic and social issues , are drawn from an extensive network of United Nations and other sources , ranging from Governments , international organizations , academic institutions and think-tanks in capital cities to non-governmental organizations , religious missions and private enterprise .  
OCHA is mandated to mobilize and coordinate the collective efforts of the international community , in particular those of the United Nations system , to meet in a coherent and timely manner the needs of those exposed to human suffering and material destruction in disasters and emergencies .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
Calls on States which have not already done so to consider ratifying the major instruments of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law , and to take appropriate legislative , judicial and administrative measures to implement these instruments domestically , drawing on technical assistance , as appropriate , from relevant international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations bodies ;  
It is truly regrettable that , despite quite a number of basic instruments in international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law which provide for the essential legal protection of civilians in armed conflict , the gross violations of their rights around the world have not yet ceased .  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,

The two human rights workers were arrested in December 1998 in connection with a popular protest , which turned violent , against the secret import and dumping by local authorities of industrial toxic waste .  They were accused of leading an unlawful demonstration and incitement to violence .  
Strengthening of the legislative process through assistance with the drafting of legislation and the encouragement of dialogue with civil society to promote informed debate on public policy matters with human rights implications , especially in the domains of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
During his stay in Haiti , the independent expert observed multiple human rights violations throughout the judicial system , which is supposed to be the principal guarantor of such rights .  
These problems , which are linked to the inefficient functioning of the criminal justice system , are compounded by the lack of human resources , the dilapidated state of the courts , and the lack of means of communication , electricity , vehicles and office supplies , and in some cases of codes of judicial procedure .  
The independent expert is closely associated with the implementation of this component , particularly since he shares the MICIVIH approach of according absolute priority to strengthening the network of local NGOs engaged in protecting human rights , a priority which is all the more justified because , to the great regret of the independent expert , the mandate of MICIVIH could not be renewed . 
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , and stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility ,  
They believe that respect , protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms contribute to political and social stability and peace , to the enrichment of the cultural and spiritual heritage of society as a whole and to mutual understanding and friendly relations between their peoples .  
The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the immutable values of peace , democracy and the rule of law , of human rights , development and social justice , and bearing in mind the sovereign equality of States , the non-interference in their internal affairs and the respect for their territorial integrity .  
The only solution to this dilemma , therefore , is to further develop the existing United Nations system in such a way that in the future it is able to intervene in good time in cases of very grave human rights violations , but not until all means of settling conflicts peacefully have been exhausted and this is a crucial point within a strictly limited legal and controlled framework .  
I support the proposal put forward by Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a global pact on common values and principles be concluded within the framework of a public / private partnership , between the United Nations and major companies , in order to lend the law of the market a human face .  
We believe that it is the sacred duty of all Governments to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that all countries have an obligation to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of their own peoples in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and international human rights instruments , and in the light of their respective national conditions and relevant laws .  
The international community now takes military action to deal with tragedies that only a few years ago would have left us indifferent , and yet we are still influenced by military assessments , strategic interests , regional solidarity , public opinion and the magnitude of any human rights violations .  
San Marino intends to continue to voice its protest against capital punishment , firmly convinced that the abhorrent instrument of death consciously and legally inflicted by one human being on another can be considered neither a valid and effective answer to defend society nor a deterrent against the spreading of criminality .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
In this connection , the recommendation of the representative of the Holy See , made during the preparatory process to the Conference against Racism , is very sound : There is a need to go deeper than historical , cultural , political or social contexts and to identify and understand the spiritual and moral dimensions which underlay the universal human condition and in particular those aspects of it leading to abuses of racial discrimination .  
The Albanian State expects that in the near future the Balkans will become a democratic region with an economy intended to reach the level of those of the developed countries , a region that respects human rights , in accordance with advanced European and global standards .  
Nigeria and indeed the entire West African subregion have devoted considerable human , material , political and diplomatic resources to the resolution of these crises in the subregion , starting with Liberia and subsequently Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau .  
The armed intervention and the decisive role played by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague , brought to bear in defence of the principles of humanity and human rights , seem to foreshadow a strengthened determination on the part of the international community to enforce respect for the fundamental values of justice and human dignity that inspired the San Francisco Charter .  
We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights , . . . to establish conditions under which justice . . . can be maintained , and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom , . . . have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims .  
Deeply concerned by the human rights situation in East Timor , and in particular reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in East Timor , as well as the situation of displaced persons in East and West Timor and elsewhere in the region ,  
Affirms that all persons who commit or authorize violations of human rights or international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations and that the international community will exert every effort to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice , while affirming that the primary responsibility for bringing perpetrators to justice rests with national judicial systems ;

To this end the Special Rapporteur welcomes the newly-created Stability Pact of the European Union for south-eastern Europe , which outlines a comprehensive approach to the region and promises the States of south-eastern Europe international assistance and eventual integration into European political and economic structures in return for ongoing progress towards democracy , respect for human rights , and regional cooperation .  
This distressing state of affairs is attributable largely to the impunity with which weapons manufacturers and arms exporters transfer small arms and light weapons to corrupt , unscrupulous and undemocratic regimes with track records of human rights violations and to rebel groups and anti-national elements which use these weapons to subject populations to brutal savagery for their own selfish ends . 
My report to the Security Council on the protection of civilians in armed conflict ( S / 1999 / 957 ) , which was considered by the Council in September , contains detailed proposals on the legal and physical protection of civilians to enhance compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights law during armed conflict .  
It was stressed that international efforts to assist refugees and seek solutions to their plight should be equitable and based on human need , regardless of the nationality , race , geographic , political or military importance of the refugee population .  
Indeed , our continent is home to two thirds of the least developed countries and to three quarters of those at a low level of human development , and almost half of its inhabitants live in absolute poverty .  
The third characteristic that contributes to the unique value proposition of the Voluntary Fund is its focus on initiatives that contribute to an architecture of the possibilities of human beings . 40 As noted above , a number of Voluntary Fund-supported initiatives have focused on building leadership , and managerial or technical skills and have thereby empowered persons with disabilities to plan , negotiate and implement practical action .  
Fourth , the United Nations Development Programme must prepare studies on industrial projects for manufacturing basic commodities agricultural and mineral where Africa again would contribute raw materials and human resources , and the international investment firms would provide financing and technical know-how in a fair manner applied to all .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
While we recognize the difficulty in the real world of achieving smart sanctions , we believe that there is a recurring need to minimize the collateral though unintended human suffering , through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and periodic review mechanisms .  
We also urge the developed countries and regional and international development institutions to provide assistance , grants and loans official and unofficial to African countries and to cancel their external debts , especially those of the poorest countries , to help them improve their economic , social and human capacities .  
It is expected that , through this dialogue , innovative ideas will emerge regarding the specific goals that the United Nations should strive to achieve in the forthcoming decades , in particular in the five core areas of its work , namely , development cooperation , economic and social affairs , humanitarian affairs , peace and security , and human rights .  
Given the intrinsic link between human rights and development , the Hearing emphasized the need to promote respect for basic human rights , and noted that the right to development is a fundamental right that must be recognized , acknowledged , upheld and seen as an integral component of human rights .  
Conscious that the ageing of the worlds population represents an unparalleled and urgent policy and programme challenge to Governments , non-governmental organizations and private groups in ensuring that the needs of the aged and their human resource potential are adequately addressed ,  
This Convention sets universal legal norms which are intended to protect children from insufficient care , ill-treatment and exploitation and to ensure their enjoyment of their fundamental human rights , including the right to survival , development and full participation in social , cultural , educational and other activities .  
Strongly condemn the exploitation of our wealth and the wicked destruction of human lives of which the country is a victim by all the foreign armed forces , above all Rwandan and Ugandan , who one day or another will leave us with a country that has been bled dry , exploited , plundered and ruined ;  
Our rich flora and fauna , marine life , mineral wealth and human potential is unparalleled , and this God-given untapped wealth can best be developed not by a single country but by our Mano River Union .  
Gravely concerned by the increasing activities of transnational organized criminal groups and others that profit from smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ;  
The participating countries and Region should be encouraged to pass legislation to criminalize smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , in all its forms and purposes , including as sources of cheap labour , and to cooperate as necessary in the prosecution and penalization of all offenders , especially international organized criminal groups ;  
Strongly deplores the serious breaches of internationally recognized rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and other persons of concern over the past year , and remains particularly preoccupied that systematic violations of human rights , blatant disregard of international humanitarian law , and policies of wholesale expulsions of populations and ethnic cleansing have caused significant displacement both internally and across borders in many regions of the world ;  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;  
Since ideology and determination alone could not secure social development in developing countries , there must be an effort during the special session to strengthen international partnerships with a view to mobilizing the necessary financial assistance , technical know-how and human resources .  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
To involve , among others , public opinion leaders , educators , religious leaders , chiefs , traditional leaders , medical practitioners , womens health and family planning organizations , the arts and the media in publicity campaigns with a view to promoting a collective and individual awareness of the human rights of women and girls and of how harmful traditional or customary practices violate those rights ;  
Recognizing that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , diseases , especially the malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
Reiterating its deep concern over the continuing violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights , particularly discrimination against women and girls , and over the significant rise in the illicit production of opium , and stressing that the capture by the Taliban of the Consulate-General of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist in Mazar-e-Sharif constituted flagrant violations of established international law ,  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;

Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
If it proved possible to reach agreement on a basic text by the twenty-third executive session of the Board in mid-December , then the Conference could be devoted to a major reflection on the experience of development with a view to identifying clear priorities for trade and development based on a practical approach involving such elements as human resource development and technical cooperation .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
While welcoming the recent developments in connection with the enhanced heavily indebted poor country ( HIPC ) initiative arising from the Cologne Summit , faster and deeper debt relief is required in order to enable African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life , and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries , and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .  
As the new millennium dawned , Bolivia hoped that the United Nations might soon be able to proclaim a world free of colonial vestiges , free of oppression and economic , political and social dependency and respectful of democratic values and fundamental human rights .  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility , and calling on all parties to cooperate with investigations into these reports ,  
Firstly , the fourteenth preambular paragraph calls on all parties to cooperate with investigations into reports of systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed in East Timor .  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility , and calling on all parties to cooperate with investigations into these reports ,  
Those constraints included , inter alia , the lack of linkages within and between productive , service and infrastructural sectors , insufficiently developed human resources , shortcomings in production related to technological capability and adaptive research , deficiencies in physical infrastructure and support services , and the inability of LDCs to generate adequate resources to alleviate those constraints .  
Urgent measures were required , therefore , to remedy that situation through , inter alia , the provision of the technical , human and financial resources commensurate with the tasks and responsibilities of the Office of the Special Coordinator , which , even with extremely limited human and financial resources , had accomplished many commendable tasks . 
The representative of the Republic of Korea said that the development of LDCs had been constrained by shortcomings in the physical infrastructure and human resource development , low levels of domestic resources , and poor performance in the agricultural sector .  
For this purpose new course materials were developed ( on the analysis of the effects of international trade policies , using a global model ) , existing material was adapted to distance learning techniques and a new project intended for Portuguese-speaking countries is currently being developed in Brazil and Cape Verde and will be extended to other lusophone countries , with the expertise of consultants specialized in human resources development in those countries .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
In opening the hearing , President de Marco emphasized the close correlation which existed among the three themes , noting that human rights remained an abstract concept for those who were starving and that economic development remained illusive without peace . 
Despite the scope of the challenges facing countries as a result of globalization , he was confident that the phenomenon was a vehicle for positive changes of benefit to humankind as a whole , since they fostered democratic systems of government that respected human dignity and encouraged countries to be responsible members of a more peaceful international community .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
I would like to emphasize that it was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriots and the binational order that led to the division of the island when the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legal Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
His own Government was committed to pursuing economic development within the framework of democratic institutions and human rights and was convinced that democracy was the only path towards fair and equitable development .  
With consistently negative economic growth and development indicators , the African countries needed an international economic and financial climate that promoted fair trade ; increased market access for African products ; stimulated net capital inflows and , above all , gave globalization a human face .  
The recently enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative ( HIPC ) arising from the Cologne Summit is indicative of the faster and deeper debt relief required in order to assist African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
All States , all peace-loving forces and all human rights organizations which place store by the Charter of the United Nations and the international human rights instruments should speak out loud and strong in protest against what is going on in the camp and should request its closure , demanding the urgent dispatch of an international commission of inquiry to the camp and determined action to put a halt to abduction and internment operations .  
It agreed on the need for good governance , an efficient administrative and institutional support structure , adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors ( A / 54 / 316 , para .  44 ) .  
Among the social and economic measures and policies aimed at developing its human resources , the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya provided education to all free of charge until completion of the elementary level , free health services , and free social security services for widows , disabled persons and the elderly .  
The recently enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative ( HIPC ) arising from the Cologne Summit is indicative of the faster and deeper debt relief required in order to assist African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
It had banned traditional practices that affected the health of women or violated their human rights , fixed the marriageable age at 18 years and amended the Criminal Code to ensure the protection of the rights of women and children ; and passed a customary and divorce law to provide one standard form of inheritance and to correct injustices suffered by women and children under customary laws .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
The Under-Secretary-General stated that the Department viewed modules as main thematic areas of action and activities , such as peace and security , economic and social development , human rights , humanitarian assistance and environment , while elements were specific documents and public information products that better illustrated those thematic categories .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
In addition , WIPO had established a specific institutional mechanism , the Worldwide Academy , which was dedicated to optimizing the use of intellectual property systems by enhancing human resources development programmes at the national and regional levels .  
Mr . Christian Tomuschat , the Commissions Coordinator , detailed its main conclusions and recommendations the fruit of a year and a half of work on the human rights violations and acts of violence which occurred during the internal armed conflict .  In its conclusions , the Commission stated that at least 83 per cent of the victims were Mayan and attributed institutional responsibility for 93 per cent of the violations to agents of the State , principally members of the army .  
In order to achieve respect for cultural differences within a context of national unity , national reconciliation and democratic coexistence , it is essential to implement a comprehensive , nationwide programme of civic education , for which the necessary human and financial resources must be provided .  
Our presence here is proof of the fact that , astonishing though it may seem , the newly developed media and means of communication can not satisfy the need human beings feel for personal and direct contact in order to establish a dialogue conducive to peace this fact was certainly not lost on the founding fathers of the United Nations system .  
Recognizing that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , diseases , especially the malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
Recognizing further that the combined effects of natural disasters , conflicts , entrenched poverty , disease , especially malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic , and lack of proper education affect the economic prospects of and efforts to eradicate poverty in the most severely affected countries , especially in Africa ,  
The methodology of the report is accountable for another obfuscation : in an effort to scale down their size and significance , the human rights abuses evident in the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium , the ethnic cleansing of Serbs after the aggression and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are immediately referenced to alleged violations of human rights by the Yugoslav side .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the ground of ethnicity ;  
Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in Iraq , which particularly affects certain vulnerable groups , such as children , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert the utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all peoples and nations will enhance cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and cultural background , advance the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and foster stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of training , dissemination and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
The General Assembly , Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
The Minister explained , however , that , while the legislation in force in Cameroon since what was generally known as the Afreedoms session @ of the National Assembly ( 1990 ) guaranteed the basic rights and freedoms enshrined in various international and regional instruments , the task of creating a genuine human rights culture , not only among the forces of law and order but also among the public , still lay ahead . 
Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations system to facilitate the active and constructive involvement of the private sector in the development process , and recognizing the importance of the global compact on human rights , labour , environment , proposed by the Secretary-General on 31 January 1999 at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos , Switzerland ,  
The special sessions strong reinforcement of human rights and the human well-being language of the Programme of Action was particularly welcome , as were the calls for intensified action in implementing the Programme of Action , and the new benchmarks in reproductive and sexual health , access to family planning services , reduced maternal mortality , HIV / AIDS prevention , gender issues and education . 
Turning to the issue of human resources development , he said that ILO considered that there was an urgent need to set in place active labour market policies to help workers cope with the growing problems of job loss and redeployment .  Training and re-training programmes , job search assistance , vocational counselling and access to good labour market information were all essential .  
However , the internal conflict had considerably diminished the pool of financial and human resources required for economic growth , and the underground economy spawned by drug trafficking had caused huge distortions , not only of economic data but also of social indicators .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
In the framework of the ongoing internal armed conflict , serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and large-scale breaches of international humanitarian law have forced a growing number of individuals and entire communities to leave their homes .  
Participants concluded that while the underlying causes of displacement in Colombia are multiple ( the internal armed conflict , land disputes , large-scale development projects , etc . ) , violations of human rights and humanitarian law are most often the immediate cause of displacement .  It was therefore argued that a drastic improvement in respect for human rights in Colombia would be the most effective way to prevent displacement .  
Having concluded that displacement is the result of violations of human rights and humanitarian law , workshop participants went on to discuss how internal displacement is not only the result of armed conflict but a strategy to militarily control disputed areas populated by communities perceived as supporters of the enemy .  
It was noted that favourable conditions for return could only be achieved if the fundamental causes of displacement were addressed and the State fully implemented the multiple recommendations made by the international community in regard to the protection of human rights and humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Considering that serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law are the foremost direct cause of forced displacement in Colombia , the workshop urged the Government of Colombia to comply with the Guiding Principles and with the international recommendations already made to address the situation , in particular by the United Nations and the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights .  
After a further massive loss of human lives , increased suffering of the civilian population and immense physical destruction , the two sides found themselves roughly at the same positions they held in late 1998 .  
The new UNSMA Civil Affairs Unit will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
The daunting problems of illegal drugs , the lack of needed humanitarian support , human rights abuses , religious extremism and terrorism will not simply go away unless and until the international community is awakened to their combined effect on the peace and security in the region and beyond and starts paying full attention to the root cause - the civil war and foreign interference in Afghanistan . 
Noting that , as the century draws to a close , the Central American countries have achieved significant progress towards the consolidation of democracy and good governance , the strengthening of civilian Governments , respect for human rights and the rule of law , and the promotion of State and economic reforms , sustainable development and regional integration , reflecting the desire of the Central American peoples to live and prosper in a climate of peace and solidarity ,  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Again stresses the need for the international community to maintain its cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , with the Central American countries and to provide them with the necessary financial resources , in a sustained manner and on soft terms , with a view to promoting effectively sustainable human development and the consolidation of peace , freedom and democracy in the region ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;  
Accordingly , in Syria , there is no basis for any discrimination , exception , restriction or preference on grounds of race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin that would in any way hamper or impede the recognition , enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political , economic , social or cultural fields , in employment or in any other sphere of public life .  
Scientific and technical progress is never used for purposes that are incompatible with the enjoyment of any human rights , including every individual 's right to life , health , liberty of person and privacy .  On the contrary , full support and encouragement is given to every materially and mentally creative innovator through the organization of annual specialized exhibitions for this purpose .  
In paragraph 7 of resolution 1999 / 26 the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
Emphasizes that while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .  
The informative and formative activities of CITE target the general public and some specific strategic groups , namely , social negotiators , entrepreneurs , union workers , legislators serving businesses and syndicates , human resources technicians , public administration functionaries and agents , magistrates , lawyers , teachers and municipal entities .  
Providing expert advice to help improve the quality of justice rendered , supporting judicial reform , helping to revamp the inhumane prison system , improving the human rights conduct of the new police force and facilitating the emergence of new state and civic institutions are essential elements of the Missions activities in the area of institution-building .  
Acutely aware of its ad hoc and temporary nature , the Mission has been pursuing a three-pronged exit strategy : strengthening the state institutions responsible for ensuring respect for human rights , reinforcing the capacity of civil society organizations and the media in the area of human rights monitoring and investigation and developing a body of documents , studies and data on key institutions and human rights issues which have been made public .  
MICIVIH currently has responsibility for providing institutional assistance ( with particular reference to the police , judiciary , the penal system , the Ombudsmans Office and civil society organizations ) , supporting the promotion and protection of human rights and verifying observance of individual rights , fundamental freedoms and due process requirements .  
Each State was entitled to protect its citizens and the human rights of the victims of the most serious crimes as it saw fit , and depending on its social , moral , cultural , legal and economic specificities .  
Recent calls for such reform were born of a political desire to protect human rights in the context of international consensus , rather than through the unilateral imposition of a single cultural model .  
In the field of operational activities , considerable progress had been made during the triennial policy review towards formalizing the view that human centred development included economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
With regard to classification , his Governments views were very close to those of UNDP , which had set out seven main categories of threat to human security : economic , food , health , environmental , personal , community and political .  
In spite of its economic , geopolitical and developmental constraints , the Jordanian Government continued to review the human rights guarantees provided through its legal , judicial and administrative systems .  
His delegation reaffirmed its full support for the principles of objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity and its belief that since human rights were indivisible and interdependent , equal importance must be devoted to economic and socio-cultural rights and to civil and political rights .  
The peace process would , however , be stalled so long as Israel continued to violate the rules of international law and international humanitarian law as well as the relevant resolutions of the United Nations . Respect for the provisions of those instruments was a prerequisite to progress in the peace process and to true improvement in the living conditions of the Palestinian people and the human rights situation . 
The report showed that the human rights situation in the occupied territories had remained very much the same as in previous years : the Israeli authorities were continuing to pursue their repressive practices , with a heavy psychological impact on the Arabs living under Israeli occupation .  
Despite that welcome development , the Israeli Government was continuing its policy of establishing Jewish settlements and confiscating Palestinian land , especially in East Jerusalem , in the area around Jerusalem , and in the Syrian Golan , and was still engaging in practices that adversely affected the human rights of the Palestinian people , with the result that in Jerusalem , the demographic , legal , cultural and historic situation was being altered .  
In their discussions with the Special Rapporteur , government officials , private individuals and members of non-governmental organizations generally agreed that there had been a gradual change in the attitude of some of the government actors , from the federal to the municipal level , who were now more inclined towards improving the overall human rights performance of public institutions and agencies .  
This political confrontation has effectively pitted local communities against each other , and as a consequence the indigenous population has paid a heavy price in terms of human suffering and remains under the constant threat of renewed violence .  
Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and recalling that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The theme will include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety and legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equal treatment ;  
The proposed missions staffing would be supplemented by international and local experts in the areas of judicial administration , penal law and procedure , constitutional law , juvenile law and legal assistance , human rights and civic education programmes .  
Resources of $ 155,000 are requested for the hiring of international and local consultants with expertise in the fields of judicial administration , penal law and procedure , constitutional law , juvenile law , legal assistance , human rights and civic education programmes .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Urges also the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , provision of basic social services , poverty eradication , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of youth , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation , respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
As a moral and pluralistic society , Indonesia was committed to promoting respect for human rights and taking into account the varied cultural , ethnic and religious composition of the nation , as provided for in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action .  
His delegation was extremely concerned about the unabated racist measures adopted by the Eritrean regime against Ethiopians living both in Eritrea and in the occupied Ethiopian territory , for whom denial of human rights , lack of legal remedies and outright discrimination had become the order of the day .  
Mr . Tekle ( Eritrea ) said that since Ethiopia had begun its systematic violation of the human rights of Eritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin , it had deported close to 70,000 of them on ethnic grounds , confined 2,000 in harsh concentration camps , was responsible for the disappearance of 1,500 more and deprived 15,000 others of both jobs and housing without allowing them to emigrate .  
Civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were mutually reinforcing , and the international community had a responsibility to ensure a holistic approach to the protection of human rights and the elimination of poverty , one of the most urgent human rights challenges .  
Reaffirming its objectives , as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to the present day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
The members of the Subcommittee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all peoples and nations will enhance cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and cultural background , advance the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and foster stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Affirms that globalization is a complex historical process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , and has a direct impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular the right to development , at both the national and the international level ;  
Expresses its grave concern at any attack upon religious places , sites and shrines , and calls upon all States , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to exert the utmost efforts to ensure that such places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected ;  
Recognizes that respect for cultural diversity and the cultural rights of all enhances cultural pluralism , contributing to wider exchange of knowledge and understanding of cultural background , advancing the application and enjoyment of universally accepted human rights across the world and fostering stable friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of training , dissemination and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
The General Assembly , Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights36 proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism , in all its forms and manifestations , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Recognizing also that accountability of individual perpetrators of grave human rights violations is one of the central elements of any effective remedy for victims of human rights violations and a key factor in ensuring a fair and equitable justice system and , ultimately , reconciliation and stability within a State ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for those laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
Bearing in mind all the extraterritorial effects of any unilateral legislative , administrative and economic measures , policies and practices of a coercive nature against the development process and the enhancement of human rights in developing countries , which create obstacles to the full realization of all human rights ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Reaffirms that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
Noting that , as the century draws to a close , the Central American countries have achieved significant progress towards the consolidation of democracy and good governance , the strengthening of civilian Governments , respect for human rights and the rule of law , and the promotion of State and economic reforms , sustainable development and regional integration , reflecting the desire of the Central American peoples to live and prosper in a climate of peace and solidarity ,  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Noting with concern the resulting exacerbation of the enormous suffering of the Afghan people , resulting in the massive loss of human life , summary executions , the deliberate abuse and arbitrary detention of civilians , refugee flows , the use of child soldiers , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive destruction ,  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
Reaffirming the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations , which , inter alia , call for collective effort to strengthen friendly relations among nations , remove threats to peace and foster international cooperation in resolving international issues of economic , social , cultural and humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
The Declaration defines basic learning needs as : essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy , and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values , and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions , and to continue learning ( art .  1 ) .  
The positions identified for the three mutually reinforcing and complementary ( integrated ) pillars of justice , police and human rights , as well as for the Office of the Representative of the Secretary-General , exclusive of the Administration , are considered the minimum necessary for the satisfactory performance of the Mission .  
The economic sanctions that the Security Council imposes on a number of countries , usually developing countries , and unilateral coercive measures are significant factors that halt the realization of the right to development , cause material and human losses in the development process and require many years to offset , particularly if such economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council continue for a long and indefinite period of time .  
New Zealand is firmly committed to the universality and indivisibility of human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
The advantage of applying existing international human rights law lies in its comprehensive delineation of the prohibited grounds of discrimination and the corresponding governmental obligations which , in the case of racial and gender discrimination , envisage structural alongside individual measures for the elimination of discrimination .  
With reference to the national experience , the Government highlighted the negative consequences of terrorist violence which constituted flagrant violations of human rights , disturbing peace , posing serious threats to public security and leading to more poverty and underdevelopment .  
In the resolution , the Commission condemned the widespread , systematic and gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in East Timor , including widespread violations and abuses of the right to life , personal security , physical integrity and the right to property .  
In response to increasing reports of violence and human rights abuses attributed to Indonesian government forces since the beginning of the year , the Special Rapporteur had repeatedly sent urgent appeals to the Government urging the authorities to protect the safety and integrity of the civilian population in East Timor and to ensure that the police and military were conducting their operations in strict compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law standards . 
In accordance with current procedures , the Advisory Committee expects that full justification for the requirements of all support account posts will be provided in the context of the comprehensive annual proposals on the total requirement for human and financial resources from all sources of funding for all departments involved in the backstopping of peacekeeping operations to be submitted to the General Assembly , through the Advisory Committee , in spring 2000 .  
The UNSMA Civil Affairs Unit , established in 1999 , will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission , was revised to read :  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Calls upon the Government of Haiti to continue structural reforms in the police and the judicial system and the improvement of the prison sector , to investigate properly politically motivated crimes and prosecute perpetrators of such crimes in accordance with Haitian law , to take vigorous action to eliminate any continuing human rights violations , including illegal arrests and detentions , and to ensure due process within a reasonable time ;  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and continuing serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continued coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross purposes ;  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Under the authority of the national committee on the use of illicit drugs , the relevant national institutions had focused their activities on human resource development , scientific research , periodic evaluation and the provision of services to the most vulnerable sectors of society , including young people .  
While the military authorities and police had improved their methods and capabilities for combating drug trafficking by acquiring greater logistical , financial and human resources , international cooperation still remained essential , since it enabled the States concerned to exchange reliable information and advanced technologies .  
In accordance with the rules governing international responsibility , we affirm the legally established right of the Republic of Iraq to seek compensation for all the losses , in terms of human , material and moral damage , that have been sustained by Iraq and its people owing to acts of aggression that are contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
There is generally some tension between human rights and the effectiveness of criminal justice systems because the rights of criminal suspects are often protected by imposing substantive or procedural requirements on police and prosecutors , supported by some form of remedy for the suspect whose rights are infringed upon .  
The Board is composed of five persons with relevant experience in the field of human rights and contemporary forms of slavery in particular , who serve in their personal capacity , as United Nations experts and are appointed by the Secretary-General for a three-year renewable term , in consultation with the current Chairman of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights , with due regard to equitable geographical distribution . 
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , including through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law have been prepared by a Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , appendix ) and deserve close scrutiny by the international criminal justice community . 
While the conceptualization of national and other more specific benchmarks has generated a great deal of discussion within the human rights community , the setting of progressive development benchmarks has been a natural outcome of the follow-up to international commitments made to implement the education goals of successive world conferences and global summits organized by the United Nations since 1990 . 
The violation of human dignity and physical integrity which torture and , in its lesser form , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment constitute , is a symptom of a malfunctioning social order .  
Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations system to facilitate the active and constructive involvement of the private sector in the development process , and recognizing the importance of the global compact on human rights , labour , environment , proposed by the Secretary-General on 31 January 1999 at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos , Switzerland ,  
However , it needed a human face , a people-centred approach based on improving the standard of living for all : poverty must be eradicated , peoples basic needs must be fulfilled and human rights must be promoted , with special attention to the status of women , children and disadvantaged groups . 
At a time of rapid and tumultuous global change , if UNDP can leverage this precious asset into a more effective role in helping countries to meet their development challenges , it will have a remarkable impact on human development and poverty eradication .  
The special session had adopted by consensus a document that identified key measures for the further implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action ( A / S-21 / 5 / Add . 1 ) , which validated the comprehensive approach to population and development issues and provided a set of new interim benchmarks for achievement of the goals of the Conference and reduction of vulnerability to human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) .  
Safety and security are basic human rights and essential to economic development , therefore it is imperative that scarce resources be invested in programmes likely to protect such rights in a responsible and sustainable way .  
We have always said that Iraq is a great country with a rich cultural heritage , home to one of the oldest civilizations known , and that , by virtue of its abundant natural , mineral , human and other resources , it has huge potential to become an economic force to be reckoned with , not only in the Gulf region but also worldwide .  
It has also noted the inability of the judicial system and of the auxiliary bodies responsible for investigations to determine criminal , civil and administrative responsibility in respect of crimes with high social impact and serious human rights violations .  
The Government of Cyprus was committed to pursuing all possible steps to ensure that women had full enjoyment of their basic human rights and were equal partners in shaping the economic , political and social life of the country .  
His delegation believed that the social sector should be given high priority in the development process , since no economic development programme could be meaningful if it did not endeavour to eliminate hunger and illiteracy , provide adequate health services , improve the quality of life , and give due attention to human values .  22 .  The Government of Eritreas economic and social policies were based on the conviction that , to be successful , development must emphasize social development .  
The Working Group was informed by several non-governmental organizations that members of the armed and security forces accused of having committed enforced or involuntary disappearances and other grave human rights violations in previous decades had not been brought to court .  
While we fully understand the desire of the Member States and the Secretariat of the United Nations to save funds by reducing the number and the size of its documents , it has been always recognized that this general 32-page limit can not be applied to thematic mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights , the annual reports of which should adequately reflect the situation of gross and systematic human rights violations on a country-by-country basis throughout the world .  
The Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments are all based on the fundamental principle of non-discrimination : everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in these instruments , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , birth or status .  
The Fourth World Conference on Women reaffirmed that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and established a number of specific strategic objectives to ensure that women enjoy their full human rights .  
All training activities carried out under the OHCHR technical cooperation programme continue to include sessions on the human rights of women , with a specific focus on concerns relevant to each professional group addressed by the training - judges , police officers , members of non-governmental organizations , government officials , military , peacekeeping personnel , human rights monitors and others .  
States were to be encouraged to adopt administrative , legislative and judicial measures so as to give effect to human rights guarantees and , in this regard , the Government reiterated its determination to enforce responsibility for violations of human rights , which constituted an essential element and a key factor in the definitive establishment of justice and national reconciliation within a State . 
The Government of Cyprus explained the existing administrative , legislative and other measures for combating impunity for human rights violations contained in its laws , in particular Part II of its Constitution which incorporates verbatim pertinent provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights , which Cyprus has ratified .  
However , to these categories there ought to be added a fourth : man-conceived disasters , including genocide , mass deportations , the use of death camps , ethnic cleansing , enforced or involuntary disappearances and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Promotes the sharing and transfer of experience through the monitoring of human settlements indicators and learning from best practices in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels and feeds back the lessons learned and experiences gained in improving human settlements conditions at the country level into global policy development processes ;  
The Nordic countries and Poland , in their responses , agreed that there was a need to address any lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , which fell outside the scope of common article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II thereto , and when effective implementation of human rights might be limited by derogations in exceptional circumstances .  
In this connection , Poland , Switzerland and the National Womens Council of Catalonia stated that fundamental standards were intended to ensure the effective protection of human beings in all situations , especially during situations of internal violence when some of the most horrible atrocities are committed , both by Governments and by non-State actors .  
In order to address that lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , of which five major situations had been identified , it would be useful to identify and draw upon international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , applicable at all times , to all circumstances and to all actors , both governmental and non-governmental , as well as any individual .  
The third issue raised by ICRC concerned the proposal of the Secretary-General that further analysis would be needed to identify the extent to which the human rights abuses which are most prevalent in situations of internal violence can be attributed to the proper and faithful application of derogation clauses set out in international treaties .  
The primary question that should be answered was whether existing and future mechanisms of international criminal responsibility obviated the need for an elaboration of f " undamental standards of humanity " , given that non-State actors could be held criminally responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and human rights crimes .  
ICRC suggested that many purposes could be envisaged : a document meant to facilitate the dissemination of the relevant norms , an instrument aimed at clarifying the substance of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflict , a text aimed at clarifying the responsibility of non-State actors , or a document aimed at bridging the gap ( if one existed ) between international humanitarian law and human rights law in situations of internal violence .  
By compiling and analysing the norms reflected in international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , a global framework of fundamental standards could be elaborated , protecting the individual at all times and in all circumstances .  
According to Turkey , the content of fundamental standards of humanity should be limited to international human rights law and not include international humanitarian law , as they concerned situations of internal violence which did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict .  
Specialized services established in order to contribute to protecting human life included medical and civil defence services , as well as special legal mechanisms to ensure respect for the rules of humanitarian law .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
The Commission also requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider the possibility of holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
Significantly , the Genocide Convention makes individuals liable to prosecution whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers , public officials or private individuals and it envisages the establishment of international mechanisms to enforce individual criminal responsibility for major human rights violations .  
With the recent resurgence of old ethnic , racial and nationalist antagonisms in various forms of intolerance , xenophobia and , in the most extreme cases , ethnic conflict , ethnic cleansing and genocide , United Nations human rights mechanisms are compelled to reflect on situations where the occurrence of racist acts and racial discrimination could degenerate into open conflict , and recommend timely specific and adequate preventive measures .  
Although ethnic conflicts may be considered autonomous and disparate , these conflicts pose a real threat to international security and generate many forms of human rights violations which must be addressed .  
Responses to situations of such conflicts designed to reduce tensions and violence based on ethnic , racial or xenophobic conflicts may include : preventive diplomacy ; early-warning mechanisms ; mediation ; promotion of tolerance through human rights education ; support to democratic institutions through better representation of all segments of the society ; affirmative action ; promotion of multiculturalism .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ( Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter ) .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development ( Agenda for Development ( General Assembly resolution 51 / 240 , annex ) , para . 
The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
Over the last 50 years , and especially since the end of the cold war , the decrease in the number of international armed conflicts has been offset by an increase in the number of civil wars and other situations of internal violence , which are characterized by massive and systematic violations of human rights .  
Human rights education can promote a change in negative attitudes or reinforce positive attitudes and behaviour so that the need and the importance of protecting and promoting human rights in the course of ones daily life and professional duties are deeply understood and assumed .  
The universal implementation of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political , is the surest preventive strategy and the most effective way of avoiding the emergence of conflict .  
The excesses of the so-called military justice , a regular cause of arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights violations , as demonstrated by cases brought before the Working Group , have prompted the Group , in its recommendations in previous reports , to underline the need for an international conference to analyse the subject and seek to limit the actual powers of the military justice system ;  
The Working Group had concentrated on five main issues , identified in 1994 , and had produced a valuable study , together with a short background paper attached as an appendix , dealing with the existence or non-existence of jurisdictional immunity in actions arising out of violations of jus cogens norms , particularly acts of a State in violation of human rights norms having the character of jus cogens .  
The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
The areas identified are education , sustainable economic and social development , human rights , equality between women and men , democratic participation , advancing understanding , tolerance and solidarity , participatory communications and free flow of information , and knowledge and international peace and security .  
We must take a doctrine of peace and make of it a specific discipline accompanied by a carefully prepared programme , in order to develop , with logical rigour and an adequate foundation , an entire body of principles and pronouncements of a scientific , ethical and pragmatic nature in the service of the categorical human imperative for peace .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of both civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights .  
It acknowledged the inherent complementarity between the refugee-specific mandate of UNHCR and the broader human rights mandates of other concerned agencies and institutions and asserted the need to maintain the mutually supportive but separate character of their respective mandates .  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;  
In the weeks that followed , members of ethnic minority groups , especially Roma and Serbs , began fleeing Kosovo owing to fear of the killings , kidnapping , looting of properties , evictions , widespread burning of villages , as well as cultural , historical and religious monuments , and other forms of intimidation directed against them.The situation of the Serb , Roma and other minority communities has been a painful one of widespread human rights violations . 
The Office will start consultations with African States in the near future on developing a framework for regional human rights cooperation in Africa that would be based on continued support by the Office to OAU regional and subregional initiatives , as well as on activities at the national level in the four areas referred to above .  
The liberalization of international trade , production and financial transactions , the increasing influence of global corporations and developments in information technology and communications all components of the globalization process are increasingly being considered from the perspective of their individual and collective impact on respect for human rights .  
At the regional and subregional levels , the Office is undertaking a number of initiatives , including a joint project with the Council of Europe focusing on preventive activities for Central and Eastern Europe ; a range of activities in the former Yugoslavia coordinated by the human rights office in Sarajevo ; and a joint project with UNDP in Nepal focusing on the legal and judicial aspects of controlling trafficking .  
Less visible but nonetheless destructive violations of human rights are the growth of poverty in rich and developing countries alike , and the marginalization caused by violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The strong plea of the High Commission is : let us , in the coming century , prevent gross violations of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights .  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
In addition , the programme , through greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on more efficient methods to prevent human rights violations and remove obstacles to the full realization of human rights . 
The Republic of China a democratic country concerned with safeguarding and promoting human rights , a world economic Power recognized by nations , and , last but not least , a nation that maintains trade relations through commercial delegations shares with deep conviction our common faith in the noble ideals of peace , solidarity and cooperation enshrined in the Charter .  
The suit demands that the United States Government , which is responsible for these human losses and injuries , be sentenced to pay a total of $ 181.1-billion in reparation as a minimum symbolic compensation for the loss of something that is clearly irreplaceable and priceless : the lives and physical well-being of the more than 5 , 500 Cuban citizens who have been victims of the United States obsessive policy against Cuba .  
Because of this situation , the world has witnessed a series of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led to the emergence of many areas of political and military conflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in the human , economic and social conditions of many regions in the world .  
Yet this is only one of the many purposes of our Organization ; to achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is no less an important goal in our Charter .  
In a sense , our endeavour to define and , indeed , to promote human security has philosophical and practical implications both positive and negative for us as sovereign States and for the United Nations as the leading global multilateral Organization .  
As a result , Bahrain has been able to build an open and developed economy that has made it possible for the country to realize comprehensive and sustainable human development , as reflected in its remarkable ranking in the human development index for five consecutive years .  
These include the shelter , management and social reintegration of tens of thousands of displaced persons , a humanitarian tragedy whose scale has not always been clearly perceived by the international community ; the protection of people and property ; the respect of human rights ; and the restoration of normal living conditions in many war-torn communities an overwhelming task that anyone would agree requires means exceeding by far the capacities of a State bled dry such as Congo is today .  
We see , on the one hand , astounding developments in many fields of human endeavour and , on the other , national and international conflicts , resulting in mass destruction of human life and infrastructure as well as the almost irreversible compromising of the ecological system .  
Our new system is clearly seriously flawed when a dispute between two powerful transatlantic partners can be settled in a political vacuum which totally ignores the very real and disastrous consequences it will inevitably unleash on the economies of a fragile group of small States . This is certainly not globalization with a human face . 
I am confident that over the next two days the debate will be characterized by new ideas and a renewed commitment to the Proclamation on Ageing , which calls for the recognition of humanity ' s demographic coming of age and the promise it holds for maturing attitudes and innovations in political , legal , social , economic , cultural and spiritual fields as our collective and determined way of preparing ourselves towards social justice , global peace , human development equality in the next century . 
The peaceful advancement of the human family and the security of its livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , external debt burden , growing technological and economic gaps between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases .  
In conclusion , may I express my delegation ' s sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Summit will help generate the renewed political will at the national and international levels that is so needed to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
In the years to come , for economies with a relative average development , the subject of employment , which was included as a commitment in Copenhagen , will be essential to overcoming the link between poverty , low productivity and insufficient levels of skilled human capital .  
My country is fully convinced that States play a great role in activating social development at the local level and in creating an enabling environment , thus implementing the Copenhagen commitments by placing social development on a strong foundation of human rights , non-discrimination , pursuit of equal opportunities and the realization of social justice .  
Improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , through international assistance for the purpose of capacity-building and human resource development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , is also necessary for the successful implementation of national programmes .  
Many specific aspects of such a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention are addressed in the General Assembly : social cohesion , the eradication of poverty , the protection of minorities and human rights , democratic governance , peacekeeping and the rule of law in internal and international relations .  
He did not give us a descriptive report , but one based on his prerogatives , responsibilities and discretionary powers , putting forward a vision and initiatives to confront what he views as threats to international peace and security and ideas on how the United Nations could respond to political , humanitarian and human rights crises .  
In the context of legislative and legal guarantees and taking into account the balance between the needs of the individual and those of society , my country has adopted several political , social and economic measures aimed at the maximum utilization of human resources and the improvement of living standards .  
All this has had a positive effect on the quality of life in Libyan society , as has the provision of all basic social services , despite the coercive economic sanctions that have been imposed on the people of Libya in 1990 s , caused serious human and material damage and hampered programmes and plans devoted to social development .  
This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .  
I wish to reiterate the commitment of the Kingdom of Swaziland to this process , which is aimed at meeting the challenges faced by our countries and our Organization in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting , as well as encouraging , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as mapped out in the Charter of the United Nations .  
If the political manipulation of human rights continues the selectivity , partiality and double standards ; if economic and social rights are ignored ; if the right to development is disregarded ; if a sectarian and abstract international human rights law is imposed ; and if all human rights are not guaranteed for all human beings conflicts will continue .  
In our view , the only worthwhile approach to this problem encompasses human rights in a comprehensive , integrated and indivisible way : all human rights , which is to say the basic economic , cultural and social needs of every individual , along with civil and political rights .  
These are , at the political level , the quest for peace with a view to bringing about a better and more united world ; at the economic level , the promotion of genuine development for the benefit of all countries and all peoples , which is a sine qua non condition for the establishment of the true collective security to which we all aspire ; and , at the social level , human freedom through the promotion of human security . 
Norway fully supports the cooperation between the OIC and the United Nations in their common search for solutions to global problems related to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic , social and technical development .  
Paragraph 3 requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
The ensuing concentration of power and influence lies in the hands of those nations , institutions and individuals that can master the wealth of information on all aspects of human interaction , be it economic , financial , political , social or cultural .  
But it counts it a continuing and profound privilege to join with the members of this General Assembly to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small , and to endeavour to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained .  
Hence , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the values of peace , democracy , rule of law , human rights , development and social justice , bearing in mind the principles of sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for their territorial integrity .  
Recent national and international events marking the day on which the 6 billionth human being was born on planet Earth illustrated that the international community is today concerned not merely with numbers but with individual human lives in trying to balance population growth with economic growth .  
The report takes comprehensive stock of the activities carried out and the resolutions adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) as part of its coordinated and effective support for the work of the United Nations in its principal areas of authority , including peace and security , human rights and economic and social development .  
This agreement , based on the promotion of international cooperation and the solution of problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , is designed to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
In the context of the process of growing interdependence , even as calls are being made for free access to financial markets , goods , services , it is paradoxical to witness situations in which obstacles to such interaction are erected unilaterally and without regard for their effects upon the human development of a people even more so when we see that those obstacles are erected by applying internal norms with extraterritorial scope or effects that run counter to international public law .  
Let me refer to the European Union Common Position of 2 December 1996 , and reiterate on this occasion that the main objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of gradual and peaceful transition to pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
The results of the discussions held in The Hague and St . Petersburg not only significantly advanced the themes of the first Peace Conference , but also helped energize a vital global debate on the role of the United Nations in preventing conflict and halting gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
In this decade the international legal order has been further developed , a number of new States have emerged , the new role and growing strength of the regional organizations has been confirmed , and strong emphasis has been placed on human rights .  
Despite the result of the referendum last May , it is of the utmost importance that the peace agreements be fully implemented , especially with regard to full respect for human rights , equal opportunities for the indigenous population , reform of the judicial system , fiscal and land reform , and reconciliation based on truth .  
A sustained and determined effort is necessary if the national peace agreements are to be fully implemented , particularly as concerns the fostering and protection of human rights , equal opportunities and judicial , fiscal and agrarian reform .  
In their recent joint declaration , the Presidents of the Central American countries expressed their resolve to undertake coordinated action on such crucial issues as protecting the human rights of migrants , combating drug trafficking and moving forward towards regional economic integration .  
Political , social and economic transformation now present us with a Central America free from armed conflict , a Central America with strengthened democratic institutions and a Central America in which peace , the protection of human rights and regional integration have been established on a solid footing .  
In a world still governed by a narrow realism , sometimes sterile but always destructive , it is clear that those who envisage a better future for humanity will have much to do to definitively set in motion the dynamic of change that is so necessary for sustainable human development .  
This year , as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions and the one hundredth anniversary of the Hague Conventions , armed conflicts in many parts of the world , including the Great Lakes region , Angola , Sierra Leone , East Timor , the Balkans and Caucasia , have given rise to frequent and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
With its unsurpassed costs in terms of human and financial numbers , claiming some 50 , 000 victims and causing economic losses exceeding $ 90-billion throughout the world , 1998 was an annus horribilis , that clearly illustrated the extreme vulnerability of developing countries to natural disasters of all types .  
Today , as we look back , we can see that what we have achieved in Mongolia over the past decade in building the institutions of democracy , promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms , unleashing private initiative and developing our external relations has constituted a major advance towards a self-governing democratic society , a private-sector-led economy and a closer association with the rest of the international community .  
Hence , gaining a growing number of adherents across cultural , social and economic lines , democracy is increasingly being recognized as an appropriate response to a wide range of human concerns , and as an ingredient for both sustainable development and lasting peace .  
At our second Conference , held in Managua in 1994 , we took another important step when we adopted the Managua Declaration and Plan of Action , which addressed issues relating to the political and reconciliation processes within national societies , human rights and the right of all nations to development , economic reforms , structural adjustment programmes and other problems facing democratic States .  
These include free , fair and competitive elections ; separation of powers ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; strengthening the rule of law and the application of practices of good governance and fundamental freedoms ; increasing the participation of civil society in the development of democracy ; creating an economic environment favourable to democracy ; and enhancing social cohesion and solidarity , among others . 
Yet all these efforts have been frustrated by hostile and aggressive actions taken by the occupying Power , which , far from showing itself ready to negotiate , has continued its policy of illegal settlements and violation of international law and human rights of the Arab people who live the bitter reality of living under occupation .  
India is vitally interested in peace , development and stability in the Middle East , a region close to our heart and with which we share bonds of history and culture , reinforced in modern times through multifaceted cooperation encompassing trade , investment , cultural exchanges , technical assistance and human resource development . 
While the United Nations has created a judicial affairs office that deals with the court system , the prosecution service and the correctional system in Kosovo , the OSCE Rule of Law Division which is part of the Rule of Law and Human Rights Department is tasked with developing mechanisms to ensure that the police , courts , administrative structures and other judicial structures are operating in accordance with international standards of criminal justice and human rights .  
Such cooperation must continue to be based on key activities of the international community , first and foremost among which are promoting the prevention and settlement of conflicts , peacekeeping and ensuring the humanitarian aspects of security and development , including respect for human rights and the rights of national minorities , refugees and displaced persons . 
The Fourth Committee welcomed the outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , held in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and it endorsed the practical benefits and potential offered in all areas of human activity by space technology , the peaceful application of which can contribute to increasing the quality of live and to sustainable economic and social development .  
It is for this reason that the ongoing illicit trafficking in and the systematic plundering of its works of art are harmful not only to the countries that own these works of art and archaeological treasures , but also to universal culture and human civilization .  
The European Union can not but remain deeply concerned that grave breaches of humanitarian law and human rights , the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , attacks against humanitarian personnel , the use of child soldiers , ethnic hatred and arms trafficking remain among the key problems of regional and international concern .  
We are committed to working in partnership with Africa to secure peace and democracy , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , political stability and economic and social development .  
We will strengthen the dialogue with the OAU and subregional organizations on concrete possibilities for backing their efforts , inter alia in the fields of early warning , preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and of awareness of the importance of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , the rule of law , a pluralist society , democratic institutions and practices , and a culture of tolerance .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
This fact has always prompted us to restate the principle of full respect for the delicate balance between the major organs of the international Organization as set out in the Charter , in particular the inherent role of the General Assembly in considering principles of cooperation aimed at relieving human suffering , including addressing the causes of conflict and the strengthening of lasting peace and sustainable development .  
Referring to the principle that good governance , transparency and human rights are essential elements for building representative and stable governments and contribute to conflict prevention , it was decided that those Governments that had come to power through unconstitutional means should no longer be expected to be received as equals in an OAU assembly of Heads of State .  
An integral part of promoting sustainable human development is respect for all social and economic rights , as well as cultural , civil and political rights .  
During the debate , the following major points emerged : globalization and the international financial crisis ; the decline of official development assistance and debt-relief initiatives ; good governance ; people-centred development ; poverty eradication ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; basic social services ; and the role of civil society in decision-making , resource allocation , development and human security .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
It is therefore important to increase the attention that is paid to the social components of economic development and to put the human person human dignity , human rights , economic and spiritual potential and , most important , life and health at the centre of national and international policies .  
For several months the world witnessed a war in the Balkans a region of the world that , in economic terms , is relatively prosperous in which the vital social infrastructure and human potential of a sovereign State were deliberately destroyed .  
Iraq was one of the pioneers in adopting organized scientific planning to mobilize and develop human and financial resources so as to achieve sustainable economic growth aimed at bringing about the prosperity of human beings and at maintaining their right to their natural resources and their environmental rights .  
At home and on the international stage , New Zealand has sought to play an active role in the promotion of the human rights of women and to ensure their full participation in society as equal partners with men , in particular supporting and encouraging sexual and reproductive health rights and other rights of women , which are central to the Programme of Action .  
We must take on the often difficult challenge of recognizing and addressing the intimate but complex links between both international and internal migration and other population and development issues.Canada is committed to continuing an active multilateral approach to migration which has as its cornerstone protection of the human rights of all migrants .  
It is the conviction of Malta that it must keep on working on the basis outlined in the Cairo Programme of Action and in accordance with the prevalent ethical and cultural values of Maltese society , as reflected in national legislation , so that , together with the international community , we may promote a decent and fulfilling life for every single human being on our planet and for future generations .  
What we all have in common is the wish and the request of peoples to have a better standard of living than they had in the past , real sustainable development and sustained growth in their countries and for their human rights and freedoms to be fully protected and observed .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
They also take into account our national priorities in such fields as social development strategies for the twenty-first century , health and environment in the context of sustainable development , development of human resources in the field of meteorology , proper management of water resources , integrated environmental management against pollution caused by industrial activity , protection of the atmosphere and the enhancement of the capacity of the States environmental research centre .  
These factors do indeed have a key role to play in terms of successful and sustainable development , and it goes without saying that human and institutional capacities are a prerequisite for addressing environmental , economic and social issues in the decision-making process simultaneously . 
What is particularly noteworthy is that , with the accelerated pace of globalization and ever-fiercer international competition , small island developing States are encountering increasingly grave challenges as a result of serious constraints such as lack of financial , technological and human resources .  
The unfortunate consequences of deterioration in the economic environment , particularly in connection with the global financial crisis , brought , in some cases , a reversal of social gains , while there was an increase in human suffering and deprivation.In the affected countries , the impact of economic adversity was felt at all levels of society , but the poorest segments carry a disproportionate burden .  
Acknowledges that the realization by women of their right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is an integral part of the full realization by them of all human rights , and that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights ;  
Support scientific research into and the development of safe , affordable , effective and easily accessible female-controlled methods of family planning , including dual methods such as microbicides and female condoms that protect against both sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV AIDS ) and prevent pregnancy , taking into account paragraph 96 of the report of the Fourth World Conference on Women ;  
Acknowledges that national machineries are necessary for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action ; and that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources and continued strong political commitment are crucial ;  
Acknowledging that special attention must be given to the mental health needs of women , including those who are marginalized because of , inter alia , race , ethnicity , religion , age , social and economic status , physical and or mental disability , exploitative commercial sex , displacement , migration and human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV AIDS ) ,  
The Working Group expressed its deep concern in relation to the continuing grave violations of womens human rights , including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the persistent and pervasive discrimination against women .  
The Working Group was concerned at the allegations of the violations of the human rights of women , including widespread arbitrary arrest , use of excessive force during arrests , incommunicado detention , prolonged administrative detention , detention of minors , torture and ill-treatment , unfair trial and forcible exile of political opponents and prisoners .  
Representatives emphasized that national machineries , in order to carry out their functions , should be equipped with adequate human and financial resources and be located where they could effectively influence government policy , preferably at a high government level , and where they can be protected from frequent political changes .  
We are confident that the Committee jurisprudence will be open to a developing interpretation of the most controversial points , in the light of the practice of other human rights treaty bodies , and also of the peculiarity of the CEDAW Convention , which provides for a wider scope of social and cultural human rights than other international instruments .  
From the practice of other international human rights treaty bodies , it is evident to the Netherlands delegation that the admissibility criteria contained in article 4 , paragraph 2 , subparagraph iii ( manifestly ill-founded or not sufficiently substantiated ) are concrete illustrations of the general admissibility criterion contained in article 4 , paragraph 2 , subparagraph ii , which provides that a communication should be compatible with the provisions of the Convention .  
We are particularly pleased to note the widely shared view that this optional protocol provides procedures for the enforcement of the human rights of women which are in no way less effective than the procedures available in other human rights instruments ; indeed that its provisions build on those existing instruments and should be interpreted in the light of the rules of procedure and the evolving practice and experience of the other human rights treaty bodies .  
Increase efforts to address the critical issues of fresh water and sanitation in human settlements in developing countries through , inter alia , the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the provision of financial resources for implementation , as elaborated in Agenda 21 , as a priority of the international agenda on sustainable consumption and production ;  
Governments at all levels , the private sector and other major groups as defined in Agenda 21 are urged to cooperate in developing waste collection systems and disposal facilities , and developing programmes for prevention , minimization and recycling of waste , to safeguard and improve the quality of life in human settlements and coastal regions in all countries , especially in developing countries .  
Recognizes that the lack of human , technical or financial resources at national level could be hindering the submission of more voluntary national reports or relevant information ;  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
The purpose of the 1991 revised criteria for least developed country status was to designate those low-income countries that were suffering from a low level of human resources and from structural weaknesses , specifically as reflected in a low degree of economic diversification .  
The Committee is fully aware of the human and material costs of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka and the deleterious effects this has on the economic , social and cultural rights of every person living in the country .  
The Chairperson reiterated his concern about the persistent lack of recognition of economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to education , as human rights , not only at the national level but also in various international entities .  
Referring to the numerous calls by the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for increased collaboration in the field of human rights among United Nations organs , specialized agencies and the various parts of the Secretariat , Mr . Alston stressed the need to build up a genuine partnership aiming at realizing the right to education as embodied in articles 13 and 14 of the Covenant . This applied equally to the various treaty bodies . 
In calling for a renewed commitment to respect economic , social and cultural rights , the Committee wishes to emphasize that international organizations , as well as the Governments that have created and manage them , have a strong and continuous responsibility to take whatever measures they can to assist Governments to act in ways which are compatible with their human rights obligations and to seek to devise policies and programmes which promote respect for those rights .  
The World Conference on Human Rights held in 1993 underscored the interdependence of all human rights , and emphasized that all societies should work to ensure the enjoyment by all their members of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , including their right to development .  
The Convention codifies women ' s right to non _ discrimination and equality with men and also establishes that women and men are equally entitled to the full enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
To that end , they pledge to increase their efforts to assess factors and obstacles that impinge on women ' s enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social , cultural and other rights and to suggest specific actions on how such obstacles might be overcome so that full enjoyment of human rights by all , without discrimination , may be realized .  
The adoption of a rigid classification of economic , social and cultural rights which puts them , by definition , beyond the reach of the courts would thus be arbitrary and incompatible with the principle that the two sets of human rights are indivisible and interdependent .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
He reported that the Centre had reinforced its technical cooperation efforts and refocused its work on the future challenges and mandates that would arise from the convention , especially through its newly launched global programme against corruption , global programme against trafficking in human beings and global studies on transnational organized crime .  
The theme will include : human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment ;  
The theme will include : human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  
Deeply concerned by the human rights situation in East Timor , and in particular reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in East Timor , as well as the situation of displaced persons in East and West Timor and elsewhere in the region ,  
Affirms that all persons who commit or authorize violations of human rights or international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations and that the international community will exert every effort to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice , while affirming that the primary responsibility for bringing perpetrators to justice rests with national judicial systems ;  
The establishment of the permanent forum should have a positive impact on construction and development for indigenous peoples in areas such as economic , political , social and cultural rights , human rights , the environment , health and the expansion of cross _ cultural bilingual education based on the world view of the indigenous peoples in each State .  
Mr . Nebenzia ( Russian Federation ) said that his country attached great importance to international cooperation for the sustainable development of human settlements and the improvement of the social and economic conditions of urban and rural populations.In that context , the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements played a vital role as guarantor of the implementation of the decisions taken at the Habitat II Conference .  
If the Government of a State were to distribute letters in which an ethnic or minority group alleged that it was the victim of repressive measures or that its fundamental human rights were not recognized in the sovereign territory of another State , the Government of Cyprus reserved the right to act in the same way if that practice continued .  
Also bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Expresses its appreciation for the activities carried out by the United Nations system , as well as the observations and recommendations contained in the report , with respect to building a political culture through human rights observance , mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , free and independent media , enhancing the rule of law and improving accountability , transparency and quality of public sector management and democratic structures of government ;  
In terms of programme areas covered by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received larger shares were human resource development , transport and communication , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources , and energy resources .  
To the contrary , tensions have increased in many parts of the world and have intensified human suffering because of a resurgence of the arms race with the attendant death , exodus , ethnic cleansing and famine .  
On that occasion the Heads of State or Government reiterated their concern over the fact that the arms race absorbs a major proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources in today ' s world , imposes a heavy burden on the economies of all countries , in particular developing countries , and affects international trade and financial and technological flows .  
Similarly , at the national level , there was a growing awareness that sustainable development , as well as the prevention and peaceful settlement of most contemporary conflicts , depended on effective guarantees of human rights .  
The universal ratification of the six core human rights treaties , including the optional protocols thereto , within the next five years , would not only serve as a decisive step towards a shared international legal commitment to the implementation of all human rights but would also symbolize the international communitys willingness to work in a true spirit of partnership to reach common goals .  
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action emphasized that all human rights were universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis . 
While supporting the principle that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights lay with States , his delegation wished to underline in that regard that initiatives aimed at undermining the territorial integrity or political unity of independent and sovereign States must not be encouraged .  
Also , within the context of the modernization of the legal system , several government committees were working with governmental organizations which played a leading role in promoting and strengthening respect for human rights at the national , regional and international levels .  
In order to bring about real improvements in the human rights situation in the whole region , it was necessary to adopt a positive strategy aimed at gradually opening up all those societies , rather than resorting to partial measures or economic sanctions resulting in the weakening of the forces of democracy and the emerging civil society , which provided the only guarantees for the promotion and respect of human rights .  
The highest officials in the country were determined to establish the commission and to ensure its independence so that it could examine human rights violations committed in Rwanda by government agencies , individuals acting under cover of the State or national or international organizations operating in Rwanda , and had explained that setting it up had taken a long time owing to the process of selecting its members , but that that process was now coming to an end .  
Once again he drew the attention of the Burundi authorities to the urgent need to ensure the observance of international standards of humanitarian law and human rights , which prohibited indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population and civilian targets during military operations .  
The 1992 amendments confirmed Moroccos support for the principles , rights and obligations deriving from the Charters of the international organizations it has joined and its commitment to universally accepted human rights principles , established the region as a local community , transformed the Constitutional Chamber into the Constitutional Council and raised the Economic and Social Council to the status of constitutional body .  
These new massacres are reminiscent of those committed at Kasika in August 1998 , when more than a-thousand Congolese were also massacred using edged weapons within the compound of a Catholic mission , in response to which the Security Council has still taken no specific action to condemn and halt once and for all this kind of flagrant violation of human rights .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
The period marked increased collaboration between ICMC and several Council agencies , particularly those that extended funding for its actions in favour of persons uprooted or forced into flight because of war and conflict , racial or ethnic persecution , human rights violations , and environmental degradation.The ICMC programmes supported by Council agencies included : 
An ecological branch of the police force was established in 1994 to curb ecological crime , carry out investigations at the request of the public prosecutor , enforce respect of protected areas and prevent the illicit dumping of dangerous and toxic substances which are injurious to the environment and human life and health .  
Article 56 of the law states that " To produce , process , package , import , export , trade , supply , transport , store , keep , have in warehouse or use products or substances that are toxic , dangerous or noxious to human health or to the environment , contrary to the requirements established in laws or regulations " entails a prison sentence ranging from one to four years and a fine .  
She hopes that the legal aspects , geographical conditions , economic , social and cultural factors and the environmental and human considerations underpinning the wise decision to abandon this scheme will be remembered should there be any similar plans in the future .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Reforms were needed to protect the rights of the child : education must be improved , childrens courts must be reformed , the practice of recruiting minors to the armed forces must be stopped , hazardous child labour must be prohibited , and the sexual exploitation of children ( who were often exposed to infection by the human immunodeficiency virus ) must be combated more effectively .  
It was convinced that the members of the Committee would , as in previous years , support in large numbers the current years resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo , as a message that genocide and ethnic cleansing were unacceptable and as a sign of solidarity with the Albanian people .  
The human rights situation left much to be desired in Belarus , especially with respect to freedom of expression : freedom of the press was limited , peaceful demonstrators and journalists had been arrested and beaten , and new media legislation violated international standards .  
Realizing that education was a necessary condition for the protection of human rights , it had introduced universal primary education and had embarked , in cooperation with regional organizations and the United Nations , on a national human rights education programme for all population groups and particularly officials in the judiciary or the executive , legislative and military branches . 
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn a mercenary act in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
This silence is alarming inasmuch as there are situations in which a country ' s press reports in abundant detail on the presence of companies involved in matters of national security and public safety without regard for human rights and in open contradiction with constitutional provisions that categorically state that internal order and security are the exclusive responsibility of the State .  
They also trained the Kamajor paramilitary troops who are fighting the rebel forces of the overthrown Government with the acquiescence of the current Government and are responsible for grave human rights violations against prisoners and the civilian population .  
The Commission attached priority to primary education , with the explicit objective to contribute to the attainment of compulsory primary education free of charge for all as required by international human rights law .  
These divergencies in terms and underlying concepts demonstrate the need for a consistent and comprehensive advocacy for the human rights approach to education so as to integrate human rights into the existing domestic educational policies and laws as well as into international strategies and monitoring mechanisms .  
Non-discrimination is the overriding principle of international human rights law and thus applies to civil and political , as well as to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to the rights of the child which cut across these two categories .  
This Guideline focuses on the review and reform of public health laws to ensure that they address the public health issues raised by HIV AIDS ; that the provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV AIDS ; and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 encourages States to enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws to protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors ; ensure privacy and confidentiality ; ensure ethics in research involving human subjects ; and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies when the laws are breached .  
With regard to the review and reform of criminal laws and correctional systems , UNDP reported that it has conducted a series of three regional training workshops on HIV law and law reform in Colombo , Beijing and Nadi , Fiji , and supported a meeting on the subject of law reform in the context of HIV AIDS and human rights in Bangalore , India , organized by the Indian Law Institute .  
At a time when ways and means were being studied to better coordinate and strengthen the special procedures system , Malaysia , although it recognized the importance of preserving the systems independence and impartiality , stressed that the human rights mechanisms needed to be adjusted and rationalized , that their effectiveness must be increased in order to improve their credibility and that their objectives must be made clear .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
In resolution 34-175 , entitled Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
At its fifty _ fourth session , the Commission , in resolution 1998-7 , approved the text of the draft declaration on the right and responsibility of individuals , groups and organs of society to promote and protect universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , as contained in the annex to that resolution , and decided to consider the question at its fifty _ fifth session .  
As this was the very first occasion for the Special Rapporteur to get acquainted with the human rights situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , I consider as preliminary the opinions , assessments and comments contained in his letter , while looking forward to an in _ depth analysis aimed at projecting a more realistic reflection of the current situation of human rights in the country , particularly concerning Kosovo and Metohija .  
In the light of the aforementioned , Lebanese law guarantees the exercise of the fundamental human rights contained in the international instruments ratified by Lebanon , free of all discrimination .  
The criminal offence of racial and other forms of discrimination ( Penal Code of Yugoslavia , art . 54 ) , involving a violation , on the basis of race , skin colour , nationality or ethnic origin , of the fundamental human rights and freedoms recognized by the international community , is punishable by six months to five years imprisonment .  
Protection , however , extends beyond safeguarding physical security to encompass the broad range of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights provided for under international human rights law .  
In a noteworthy educational project that takes a holistic approach in addressing the needs of the internally displaced and host populations alike , the Norwegian Refugee Council ( NRC ) is developing a nationwide human rights education programme which will provide training and course material on human rights standards to all schools .  
In recognition of the fact that they are based on existing human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , the workshop affirmed that the Guiding Principles do not seek to create a privileged category of persons or to establish a separate legal status for the internally displaced .  
Examining the challenge of averting internal population displacements , the workshop recognized that prevention is a multifaceted undertaking , involving a range of related tasks : eliminating poverty and promoting sustainable development ; ensuring respect for human and minority rights ; establishing equitable and democratic forms of government ; encouraging the peaceful resolution of disputes ; ending social injustice and averting the growth of ethnic or communal antagonisms .  
Further standards are likely to be elaborated and mechanisms established at the international level , especially to ensure that genetic research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human rights and dignity , particularly of vulnerable groups of people . 
The mandate of UNMIBH is to assist the parties in their obligations to provide a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms.The Mission consists of an International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) and a civilian office .  
The Bah International Community , with over five-million members from all strata of society organized as approximately 17 , 000 local communities and 175 national and regional communities , is committed to peace and engaged in a wide range of activities.These activities include but are not limited to fostering grass-roots participation in sustainable development initiatives , advancing the status of women , eliminating racism , and promoting and protecting human rights . 
CHEC has played an active participatory role in most of the major United Nations global conferences since the early 1970 s , with human ecology introducing Commonwealth professionals , international and national NGOs and Governments to the connections between social , economic and ecological systems and human development .  
The CMAs Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics , which were developed in 1993 , are unique in that they represent the only available internationally recognized code of medical ethics to ( a ) deal with conditions of practice in developing countries ; ( b ) set out the ethical obligations of health professionals to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community ; and ( c ) be annotated throughout with references to corresponding internationally recognized human rights instruments .  
Providing increased financial and technical assistance to small island developing States for building human resource and institutional capacity at the national and regional levels ;  
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
Taking into account the progress already made in international and subregional cooperation and coordination to make the most effective use of existing facilities , it should be noted that the major constraints for small island developing States are not so much the lack of scientific knowledge and technology as the shortage of financial and human resources more specifically , the lack of a critical mass of qualified scientists and associated institutions .  
While the Dayton Agreement stopped the fighting and the most egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , underlying issues were to a large extent left to the parties to resolve among themselves on the basis of the Dayton principles .  
Torture is one of the vilest acts to be perpetrated by human beings upon one another.The proceeds paid in to the Fund will contribute to projects providing medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide .  
It is sad but true that the sovereignty arguments can be used and sometimes have the practical result of finding excuses for repressive , even murderous Governments which are engaging in gross violations of the human rights of their own citizens .  
Since the situation of human rights in Myanmar is worsening and the repression of civil and political rights continues unabated , the Special Rapporteur feels bound to renew the detailed recommendations he made in paragraphs 7 to 97 of his last report to the Commission on Human Rights ( E CN . 4-1998-70 ) and in paragraphs 61 to 63 of his interim report to the General Assembly ( A 53-364 ) .  
Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote the role and capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries within the framework of a dialogue between the private and the public sector .  
As members of an organization responsible for the protection of and assistance to more than 26-million people who have sought safety from persecution , war or massive human rights abuses , UNHCR staff members around the world witness daily the untold suffering caused by landmines.Not only do landmines force people to leave their homes in search of safety , they also imperil their flight and later hinder their return .  
This is why we will not support proposals that are designed to subordinate respect for human rights in the context of armed conflict , in accordance with international humanitarian law , to questionable military requirements .  
Mr . LEWIS ( United Nations Childrens FundUNICEF ) said that the establishment of an effective and fair international criminal court would send the unequivocal message from the international community that heinous violations of human rights could not go unpunished .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
The circulation of press organs is not authorized , permission is not given for the functioning of new non _ governmental human rights organizations , which have been waiting for years to be recognized , the movements of the population within the country are controlled by military checkpoints , there is oppressive supervision of all private activity and in practice political dissent is viewed almost as a crime , particularly by the peripheral authorities of the mainland region .  
The problem of impunity was addresses in the agreements reached between the Government and the political parties and there is a formal commitment - set forth in presidential decrees - to impose administrative and judicial penalties on those found guilty of human rights violations .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
The introduction to the Principles contains a refinement of previous working definitions : internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence , in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict , situations of generalized violence , violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters , and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border .  
The argument for including reference to these disasters in the definition is based on cases where Governments respond to such disasters by discriminating against or neglecting certain groups on political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds or by violating the human rights of the affected population in other ways , thereby creating special protection needs .  
WFP welcomed the Principles as a well-formulated consolidation of relevant elements of existing international human rights and humanitarian law , presented in clear , concise language which would increase international awareness of the specific problems internally displaced persons confront as well as the legal norms relevant to addressing their needs .  
Nevertheless , the situation in Azerbaijan underscores that protection for the internally displaced must extend beyond safeguarding their physical security to also encompass the broad range of economic , social , civil and political rights provided for under international human rights law .  
Those approached for consultation include representatives of the office of the Secretary-General and of the ERC , relevant United Nations and other international agencies and organizations engaged in human rights , humanitarian and development work , and academic experts familiar with the issue of internal displacement and the mandate .  
She extended her congratulations to the new members elected at the tenth meeting of States parties , stating that they had joined the human rights treaty body responsible for promoting and defending the rights of half of humanity .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term discrimination against women shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
But the socio-political burdens , the persistence of an apartheid culture which can not be transformed quickly , limited financial resources and still inadequate human resources constitute a considerable hindrance , not to mention the need to take account of the time factor , with South Africans impatient to taste the fruits of freedom even though the quiet revolution under way dates back only to 1994 . 
Some unilateral coercive measures applied against Iran , as well as their adverse economic and social effects on the Iranian people , are reflected in the report ( A 53-293 ) submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the General Assembly under the agenda item entitled ' Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms ' .  
A system permitting an independent body , consisting of respected members of the community , representatives of legal and medical professional organizations and persons nominated by human rights organizations , to visit and report publicly on any place of deprivation of liberty should be set up as soon as possible .  
The Fourth World Conference on Women reaffirmed that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and established a number of specific strategic objectives to ensure that women enjoy their full human rights .  
The action to be taken by Governments includes a range of practical and systematic measures directed at the full implementation of human rights instruments , the promotion of human rights education , the creation of national institutions for promoting women ' s rights , the promotion of the human rights of indigenous women , and the adoption of strategies for the mainstreaming of gender perspectives through increased and strengthened efforts and cooperation .  
The wide-ranging dialogue , with questions from Governments and non _ governmental organizations , covered such issues as female genital mutilation ; violence against women ; womens economic , social and cultural rights ; and ways and means of improving United Nations actions protecting the human rights of women .  
Since her appointment , the independent expert held permanent consultations with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and visited several countries ( Albania , Bulgaria , France , Portugal and Yemen ) where she held consultations with Governments , international organizations , United Nations bodies , Programmes and Funds , as well as key non _ governmental organizations with extensive knowledge on human rights and extreme poverty .  
Further to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognized that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his her civil and political rights .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized ( art . 1 ( 1 ) ) .  
In resolution 51-178 , the General Assembly expressed its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries and reaffirmed that the satisfaction of basic human needs was an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and participation in cultural and social rights .  
The poverty trap in which the poorest of the poor find themselves shows how human rights are indivisible and interdependent : the right to an adequate standard of living , to housing , to education , to work , to good health , to employment , to the protection of the family , to respect for privacy , to legal status and registration as a citizen , to life and physical integrity , to justice and participation in political , social and cultural life .  
The contribution of those living in extreme poverty could be of decisive importance in current thinking on sustainable human development and the right to development , especially since the concept of development is no longer viewed only from an economic standpoint , but also in social and cultural terms .  
International economic sanctions , particularly when imposed by the Security Council , should be conceived in such a way as to avoid aggravating conditions of extreme poverty in the countries concerned.In particular , they should be compatible with the effective exercise of human rights _ and especially economic , social and cultural rights _ by civilians .  
A meeting with the independent expert should be organized in 1999 in order to draw up for the international community the basic elements of a preliminary draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
The draft should use as its starting point the preamble common to the two international Covenants of 1966 , as well as other relevant instruments which recognize that the ideal of the free individual , delivered from fear and poverty , can not be achieved without the creation of conditions allowing each person to enjoy all human rights .  
Although at times a writer may make outrageous statements , even wounding cultural sensitivities and commonly held beliefs , literature remains a basic medium through which imagination and the striving of the human mind are expressed most freely and in the most provocative forms .  
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
Mr . Theuermann ( Austria ) said that he had understood , during the consultations held with the sponsors of the draft resolution , that paragraph 4 had been amended and that after the words fundamental human rights , it had been agreed to add the phrase and reaffirms that the human person is the central subject of development .  
To involve , among others , public opinion leaders , educators , religious leaders , chiefs , traditional leaders , medical practitioners , womens health and family planning organizations and the media in publicity campaigns , with a view to promoting a collective and individual awareness of the human rights of women and girls and of how harmful traditional or customary practices violate those rights ;  
In terms of coverage of programme areas at the global level by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received large shares were human resources development , transport and communications , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources and energy resources .  
Participation in international and regional arrangements allows them to pursue mutually complementary objectives in a holistic manner and to benefit from the synergy generated , but it also burdens them with a multitude of obligations which further stretch their limited resources , both human and financial .  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of OHCHR , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
The system of periodic reporting established within the context of all major international human rights instruments is the central element in monitoring full and effective national implementation of international human rights standards .  
As a result of extensive media outreach and the dissemination of human rights information materials translated into local languages by UNICs , the Secretary-Generals Human Rights Day message was widely publicized , articles and commemorative newspaper supplements were published , public service announcements on the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration were broadcast , and Centre directors appeared on a number of radio and television programmes .  
Secondly , we are somewhat concerned that the reference at the end of the fourth preambular paragraph to human rights and fundamental freedoms could be misconstrued by certain quarters in order to promote objectives which are in fact contrary to the stated objectives of this draft resolution and to promote interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States .  
Those materials included international human rights instruments , memorandum and election reports issued by the Special Representative , relevant domestic laws , training curricula , and free and fair elections posters developed by the office .  
Article 1 of the Declaration states that the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .

The ongoing human suffering inflicted by conflicts , from Afghanistan to Angola and from the Middle East to the Great Lakes , is a daily reminder of the need for a new and concerted response at the highest political levels from Governments , which bear the primary responsibility for protecting civilians , from the Security Council , and from all others who can help cover the considerable distance still to be travelled if the international community is to find truly effective solutions in this area of acute human need .  
Sixthly , the creation and entrenchment of robust legal structures which adequately defend the rights of civilians and act as a real deterrent to potential violators of international human rights law remains a vital component in a global approach to the protection of civilians .  
We wish to design the strategic guidelines for the development of East Timor as the most effective means to correctly allocate both human and material resources and to obtain genuine sustainable development for the newly emerging independent nation .  
In my delegations view , the mission sent a strong signal and conveyed the Security Councils genuine , unanimous determination to move ahead in the peace process , to put an end to the plundering of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to take up the question of the massive violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law that have been taking place on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the aggression began . 
It is recognized , however , that to achieve substantive progress the leadership of Bosnia and Herzegovina has to be fully committed to the speedy achievement of a durable peace , mutual accommodation and the establishment of political , human and legal rights .  
The proximate cause of conflict may be an outbreak of public disorder or a protest over a particular incident , but the root causes are more likely to be found in socio-economic inequities , systematic ethnic discrimination , denial of human rights , disputes over political participation or longstanding grievances over the allocation of land , water and other resources .  
In our view , the seeds of civil strife can invariably be found in places where Governments lack legitimacy , where governance is weak or unrepresentative , where irrational values such as fundamentalism , racism , tribalism , ethnic discrimination , social injustice , and violation of human rights are practised officially or unofficially .  
Given that most of the conflicts on the Security Councils present agenda do not relate to conventional territorial disputes , but rather to ethnic reasons , religious intolerance , abject poverty , control over natural resources or systematic violations of human rights , an opportunity is created for the Economic and Social Council to cooperate with the Security Council through recommendations conducive to conflict prevention , an area which traditionally had seemed to be outside its sphere of competence .  
A genuine and sustainable peace can be achieved only when proper living conditions are insured for all our inhabitants and when there is a sufficient level of economic development for everyone to meet his basic needs , when fundamental human rights are respected and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic channels .

While it is true that East Timor must rely on its bilateral and multilateral partners and that the mission should not do anything that those partners are prepared to do , I nevertheless believe that there are vital parts of government , particularly in the areas mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report those of central management , fiscal management , justice and human rights , and security and national sovereignty where it would be entirely justified to place advisory staff and a small number of line managers in the East Timor Government . 
Suffice it to say that we are deeply concerned not only by the casual manner of according a parallel status to this bunch of discredited criminals , but also by the dilution of and utter disregard for the popular will of Somali civil society , which has throughout borne the full brunt of egregious human rights violations perpetrated by the same individuals . 
The main objective of the Kindu deployment , which would be robust enough to deter any potential attackers , would be to establish a secure base from which civilian personnel who deal with disarmament , demobilization , reintegration , repatriation ( DDRR ) and human rights issues and provide humanitarian assistance would be able to go into the area to carry out their work .  
My delegation would like to join in the unanimous tribute to the French delegation for its work in presiding over the Council last month and to congratulate it for the outstanding way in which it handled the tragic events that plunged the United States of America and the world into mourning as a result of the horrendous attacks on New York , Washington D.C . and Pennsylvania , which caused incalculable human and material loss .  
While the new Attorney-General has responded favourably to our proposal for monthly working-level meetings , with a view to moving forward the many outstanding and complicated cases of serious crimes involving both Indonesia and East Timor including by judicial cooperation and the support we will continue to extend to the new ad hoc human rights tribunal that President Megawati has decided to establish , with a view to taking to court the first group of suspects identified last year by the then Attorney-General much still needs to be achieved in this area .

We note with interest the remark contained in paragraph 10 of the report that the history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , regardless of the political system or governing authority in place , has been one of systematic abuse of its natural and human resources , such that a country noted for its vast natural resources was reduced to being one of the poorest and debt-ridden by the early 1990s . 
Article 1 , paragraph 1 , of the Declaration of 1986 states : The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The article spells out three principles : first , there is a human right called the right to development which is inalienable ; second , there is a particular process of economic , social , cultural and political development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized ; and third , the right to development is a human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy that particular process of development .  
However , they will not be regarded as a process of development , as objects of claim , as human rights , so long as they are attended by increased inequalities or disparities and rising concentrations of wealth and economic power , and without any improvement in indicators of social development , education , health , gender balance and environmental protection and , what is most important , if they are associated with any violation of civil and political rights .  
It refers to the realization of all the rights and freedoms recognized as human rights - civil and political rights and economic and social and cultural rights - in their totality as an integrated whole , as all these rights are interrelated and interdependent .  
Since the right to development has been recognized as a human right distinct from the individual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , it is indeed necessary to consider a monitoring mechanism that is separate from the treaty bodies .  
The international community should therefore renew its support for the Office by at least maintaining the level of its contributions thereby enabling it , until such time as definitive solutions were found , to relieve human suffering , particularly in the developing countries , which received the largest number of refugees .

Meetings were held with authorities at the local and national level with the purpose of gathering additional information on allegations , and to assist the authorities in their role of promoting human rights by sharing information on allegations collected by the Office .  
The Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments assert the fundamental principle of non-discrimination : everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in these instruments , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , birth or status .  
The Fourth World Conference on Women reaffirmed that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and established a number of specific strategic objectives to ensure that women enjoy their full human rights .  
It must , however , not be forgotten that migrants are people and that , as such , they have abilities , strengths and potential that need to be enhanced and developed on the basis of respect for their cultural identity , their religious beliefs and all the ways in which they express themselves as human beings and persons wishing to live in dignity .  
According to Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction . . . .  
The Declaration provides guidance for realizing development and human rights in a complementary and comprehensive manner , and identifies international cooperation as a duty of the international community ; in this framework , international cooperation should focus on the elimination of obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and the formulation of international development policies for ensuring development and eliminating obstacles thereto .  
The Declaration emphasizes the important role of international cooperation for , and the valuable work of individuals , groups and associations in contributing to , the effective elimination of all violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of peoples and individuals , including in relation to mass , flagrant or systematic violations of human rights .  
That the status of the practices of democracy , rights and freedoms in the French-speaking community over the past 10 years reflects undeniable progress : the constitutional recognition of the importance of human rights , the establishment of the institutional framework for democracy and human rights , the existence of checks and balances , progress in establishing multiparty systems in many French-speaking countries and in holding free , credible and transparent elections , the contribution of the opposition to the working of democracy , the promotion of local democracy through decentralization ;  
That the current status also reflects some shortcomings and failures : recurring conflicts , interruptions in democratic processes , genocide and massacres , serious violations of human rights , the persistence of behaviours hindering the development of a democratic culture , the lack of independence in certain institutions , and economic , financial and social constraints , which cause citizens to lose faith in democracy ;  
Democracy is a system of universal values and is based on recognition of the inalienable nature of the dignity and equal value of all human beings ; everyone has the right to play an active role in social , professional and political life and to enjoy the right to development ;  
The rule of law implies that all institutions are subject to the law and also implies the separation of powers , the free exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as the equality before law of citizens , male and female ; all of these aspects form the constitutive elements of a democratic system of government ;  
The Special Rapporteur then examines the differences between traditional and new forms of mercenary activities , the relationship between terrorism and mercenary activities , the problems raised in connection with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law by private security and military assistance companies operating internationally and the limits and shortcomings of the legal definition of mercenary activities .  
Such arrangements are preferable because they are regulated by clear legal provisions , act in accordance with a transparent line of command and are fully responsible for any violations of international humanitarian law or human rights .  They are also familiar with the territory and the peoples where they operate .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to prevailing standards of international humanitarian law applying to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
Categorizations of education into primary , elementary , fundamental , or basic are not internationally comparable and are unsuited to the requirements of international human rights law , which embodies the principle that children have to be in school until they reach the minimum age for employment .  
These killings are symptoms of deeply rooted and complex social , economic and political problems coupled with surging crime rates , which continue to plague the human rights situation in these countries .  
However , in the event that the national justice system is unwilling or unable to carry out this function , the international community must ensure that widespread and systematic human rights violations are dealt with under a wider , universal jurisdiction .  
By social protection , we understand the responsibility of societies to see that the fundamental needs of all are met , based on universal human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural .  
It justly identified deepening poverty and inequality , proliferating conflict , the deadly spread of the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) and continuing discrimination , particularly against women and girls , as formidable challenges in developing future actions for children .  
The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna had reached consensus on areas for action and objectives for the promotion of human rights , which no longer covered only civil and political rights but also , on an equal footing , economic , social and cultural rights .  
The policy of civil harmony , introduced by the President of the Republic and clearly ratified by popular referendum , the goodwill and clemency measures , and the unusual openness in the political arena and among the communications media reflected the determination of the Algerian people and of the public authorities to continue to strengthen the democratic process , creating a genuine culture of human rights and a more just society , without fear or arbitrariness .  
Until recently , the right to development had not received the recognition it deserved , and yet several developing countries had been chastised for alleged human rights violations , and their failures had been magnified disproportionately , while they were doing their utmost to satisfy the basic necessities of their rapidly growing populations .  
The Administration was determined to pursue its current efforts to consolidate its achievements in social , cultural , economic and political fields , and to intensify its endeavours to ensure the progressive enjoyment of all aspects of human rights by the people of Myanmar .  
A high-level council for human rights had been established , with links to international organizations and local non-governmental organizations , and efforts were being made to involve the people in public life , especially through the establishment of non-governmental organizations in the human rights field dealing with political , social and economic questions .  
Despite the strenuous efforts of the international community to protect human rights and ensure fundamental freedoms , gross human rights violations continued to occur in many areas of the world , particularly areas embroiled in civil wars and conflicts , during which innocent civilians , including children and women , were victims of the indiscriminate use of force .  
The public authorities guaranteed the effective implementation of human rights , and all detected abuses had received the judicial and administrative attention required by law .  
The declaration should affirm the right of every human being hence , also those who are deprived of all their essential rights , wherever in the world they may be to live in an environment in which their human dignity is respected and to enjoy their fundamental rights fully and completely and thus be able to assume their responsibilities towards their families and communities .  It should take into account the efforts and initiatives of individuals and groups living in extreme poverty .  
The role of the Working Group on Communications , under the revised procedure , is to examine communications and any governmental replies with a view to bringing to the attention of the Working Group on Situations any particular situations which appear to reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 11 The Working Group of the Subcommission will now meet after the annual session of the Subcommission rather than before , as was previously the case . 
The representative of New Zealand , noting the absence of a legal framework specific to internally displaced persons , stated that such persons were of course covered by international human rights law and that there was no excuse for States not to follow such international human rights principles and the legal guidance based on them as contained in the Guiding Principles ( S / PV . 4130 ) .  
The statement provided an opportunity to recall the inclusive and broad-based process through which the Principles were developed , their basis in existing international human rights and humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , and to inform delegates of the ways in which the Principles were proving valuable to international organizations , NGOs , displaced communities and also to Governments . 23 .  As a sign of the increased and welcome emphasis on internal displacement , a panel discussion on the issue was convened during the Segment , moderated by the Emergency Relief Coordinator a.i .  
First and foremost , they are to engage in dialogue with national and local authorities , in particular to impress upon them their primary responsibility for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons in conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law , as elaborated in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement .  
That was creating a vicious circle in which the right to freedom of expression had only limited relevance for those who were hungry and , likewise , the right of freedom of association for those who were homeless or the most generous provisions of human rights treaties for those who were illiterate or were struggling to meet their basic needs .  
Governments had a key role to play in implementing policies aimed at promoting financial , social and economic stability , harnessing the benefits of globalization and promoting and protecting human rights at the national and international levels .  
Its innovative programmes in the field of sustainable development , for example the BIOTRADE initiative and the greenhouse gas emission trading rights programme , could sow the seeds of a future development model featuring economic growth compatible with life , human values and nature .  
The climate of tension resulting from dangerous Israeli actions , including killing of defenceless children , had impaired development activities and threatened the human resource base of present and future Palestinian generations .  
Moreover , pending the conclusion of consultations with the Government of Angola and until the establishment by the Security Council in its resolution 1268 ( 1999 ) of 15 October 1999 of the United Nations Office in Angola , the substantive MONUA personnel required to maintain liaison with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities of Angola , as well as its human rights component , were also retained in the country as part of the Observer Missions staffing establishment .  
These efforts will be pursued in an integrated manner , supported by the three global programmes against transnational organized crime , trafficking in human beings and corruption , and in close coordination with the global programme against money laundering of the Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention .  
Mongolia reiterated its keen interest in continuing to cooperate with the Office of the High Commissioner in the four areas of action included in the Framework for Regional Technical Cooperation : formulating national action plans ; strengthening national human rights institutions ; human rights education ; and strategies for promoting economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
With respect to the financing of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , although the regular budget for the biennium 2000-2001 included a modest increase in the resources allocated to the human rights programme , it was not sufficient to meet the demand imposed by the growing number of human rights programmes carried out by the United Nations system .  
Her Government was gratified that during the current year , the Commission on Human Rights had recognized the inseparable links between good governance and respect for human rights , and it looked forward to continuing to cooperate with other Governments , particularly in the Asian and Pacific region , in order to find practicable ways of giving good governance the priority that it deserved . 
Australia particularly deplored the human rights situation of women and girls in Afghanistan as a result of the Talibans strict social policies , and appealed to all Afghan factions to respect universal human rights standards and to abide by the principles of international law by allowing free and safe access for United Nations personnel to deliver vitally needed humanitarian aid .  
To that end , the international community must take the economic , social and cultural aspects of human rights into account by promoting and implementing the relevant international conventions so that they could have a real impact on those rights and on the improvement of the living conditions of all people .  
Chile was a nation acting in full unison with the international community , possessed of a civil society that was increasingly involved in national affairs , a respect for human rights and the rule of law and courts that dispensed justice strictly and responsibly , a nation with an open , booming economy , which was working steadily to do away with inequalities .  
His Government had always attached great importance to the protection of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , as reflected in his countrys Constitution , which guaranteed all citizens those rights .  
It complied with international human rights instruments and conventions on the basis of its historical , religious , economic and cultural heritage , always within the framework of political pluralism , freedom of expression and elected representation in peoples assemblies and local bodies and in popular organizations covering all sectors of the population .  
UNFPA is also working collaboratively with key United Nations agencies and other relevant partners in the follow-up to UNCED through the Task Manager system , including global initiatives in the areas of basic social services , ageing , gender , youth , health , human rights , education , HIV / AIDS , food security and sustainable development to highlight the linkages between population and reproductive health , a higher quality of life , poverty reduction and the provision of an enabling environment .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction whatsoever , was also underlined .  
Bearing in mind the existing efforts in this respect , it is necessary to enhance efforts at evaluating and addressing the impact of international economic issues such as international macro-economic decisions-making , debt burden , international trade , market access , functioning of international financial institutions , transfer of technology , bridging of the knowledge gap ( digital divide ) , impact of intellectual property regimes , fulfilment of international development commitments and migration issues on the enjoyment of human rights .  
The Working Group underlined the importance to realizing the right to development of strengthening good governance at the national level including through building effective and accountable institutions for promoting growth and sustainable human development , while recognizing of course that responsibility for determining and implementing good governance practices rests with the State concerned .  
At the national level these pertained to a regulatory framework , legal security , combating corruption , political and macroeconomic stability , market size ( through regional economic cooperation ) , growth potential and the availability of infrastructure and human resources .  
These measures included , in particular , improving the policy and operational framework for FDI , so as to put it on a par with best practice ; rationalizing fiscal incentives ; setting up a super agency to promote and facilitate investment ; fast-tracking privatization ; and implementing strategies for upgrading the human capital base .  
In addition to the five major themes on its agenda , the World Conference should also take up other important issues , especially ways to reduce ethnic tensions and to prevent ethnic and racial conflicts ; the economic impact of racism ; discrimination against migrant workers ; the question of asylum-seekers , refugees and disabled persons ; trafficking in human beings ; assaults on minorities and vulnerable groups ; the rights of indigenous peoples ; and the role of the Internet and of communications technologies .  
His delegation wished to emphasize the importance of intensifying international cooperation with a view to implementing the Vienna Declaration , which set out recommendations in the following areas : protecting the environment and managing natural resources , using space applications for human security , development and welfare , advancing scientific knowledge of space and protecting the space environment , enhancing education and training opportunities and ensuring public awareness of the importance of space activities .  
The Court , inter alia , said : The political decision not to end the conflict by violent means but to seek negotiated and concerted solutions is an act of sovereignty on the part of the State , since it adopts exceptional measures to deal with an irregular situation , recover its capacity to suppress and punish crime and bring fresh impetus to a just , social , political and economic order which truly protects and secures human rights .  
Among the facts which the report fails to mention are the initial study of ideas on a cease-fire and termination of hostilities designed to provide a climate more favourable to the building of peace ; the agreement on human rights and international humanitarian law in the zone proposed for peace talks with the ELN ; and the ELNs unilateral and unconditional return of individuals whom it was holding .  
The Special Representative wishes , once more , to conclude his report by urging all concerned authorities and organizations , in Africa as well as in the United Nations , to use all possible means to ensure that peace and security finally prevail and are respected throughout the Great Lakes region ; that all civilian populations in the region are fully protected ; and that their basic economic needs are fulfilled .  These are the fundamental requirements for allowing a culture of human rights to develop and to take deep root in the region .  
The High Commissioner of Human Rights , closing the seminar , emphasized the need to make the links between human rights and poverty explicit , so that human rights principles would be used both by the poor to know and claim their rights , and by the international community to provide special protection to those in extreme poverty .  
The Expert Seminar on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty identified the need for new guiding principles , which would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of extreme poverty , that clarified definitional issues within the framework of human rights and that set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
Member States should be invited to consider adopting at the national level such measures , including legislation , that would ( a ) discourage all actions and activities , commercial or otherwise , that could be prejudicial to the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories ; and ( b ) promote full respect for the human rights of peoples living under foreign domination and facilitate their recourse to judicial proceedings in order to gain economic and social restitution .  
The Committee notes the establishment of the Justice and Legal Systems Research Institute , which is contributing to the review of existing national legislation in the light of the standards set by applicable international human rights instruments , including the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
Additionally , it is recommended that the State party undertake further measures , including the allocation of adequate human and financial resources , to develop youth-friendly counselling , care and rehabilitation facilities for adolescents , especially girls , which would be accessible by them without parental consent ; in this regard , the Committee notes the development of Adolescent Health Corners at the regional level and recommends that the State party pursue its objective of establishing such facilities at the district level .  
The Committee recommends that the State party conduct a comprehensive review of the Basic Law and domestic laws , including administrative regulations and legal procedural rules , to ensure that they conform to international human rights standards , including the Convention , that they are sufficiently clear and precise , are published , and are accessible to the public .  
The Committee recommends that the State party take all effective measures , including enacting or rescinding legislation where necessary , to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in the recognition , exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil , economic , political , social and cultural life .  
The Committee welcomes the State partys efforts in the field of education , in particular the inclusion of human rights teaching , including childrens rights , in the school curricula , but it remains concerned about the high drop-out and repetition rates in primary and secondary schools , disparities between urban and rural areas in terms of access to education and to quality education , the insufficient number of well-trained teaching staff and childrens limited access to materials and text books .  
The discussion is expected to explore the impact that the violence suffered by children in schools and within the family has on their enjoyment of all other human rights , and in particular the right to development of the child , including physical , mental , spiritual , moral , psychological and social development in a manner compatible with human dignity .  
The theme will include : human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  10 .  Adoption of the report of the Commission on its fifth session .  
The theme would include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  
Recalling that , according to the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights , the international community must treat all human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , and that while the significance of the national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Reaffirm that national human rights institutions should be established following an appropriate and inclusive process of consultation and be independent , pluralistic and based on universal human rights standards ;  
Reaffirm that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to , inter alia , financially and technologically support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to assist them , wherever possible , in the fulfilment of their obligations with regard to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) United Nations organizations are willing to cooperate ; ( b ) all parties concerned display the necessary political will ; ( c ) sufficient human and financial resources are available ; and ( d ) the economic and political situation of African countries is stable .  
The provisional expansion of UNOMSIL was supported by additional resources utilized for the deployment of military observers and additional international civilian staff in the fields of political and civil affairs and human rights , as well as for the necessary administrative , technical and logistical support services .  
In the area of information management , priority is attached to completing the implementation of a global information system on human resources , including an automated system of collecting and processing vital data on staff members and applicants with a view to facilitating related processes with respect to filling vacancies with internal and external candidates , including those from the national competitive examinations .  
The form of the assistance included study tours and training and the fields covered were corruption , crime detection , crime prevention strategies , criminal information collection and analysis , customs , drug-related crime , economic crime , evidence-gathering , extradition , financial investigation , institutional structures , institution-building , investigation materials , international standards and human rights , juvenile justice , money-laundering investigations , mutual legal assistance and organized crime .  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported conducting a wide range of activities aimed at strengthening human rights in the administration of justice , noting that further information was contained in a forthcoming analytical report of the High Commissioner to the Commission of Human Rights on the implementation of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 104 ) .  
The delegations also cited the report of the Secretary-General , which identified inadequate or unaffordable transport as factors contributing to excessive building and population congestion , causing deterioration of local environments , and noted that inadequate urban transport systems are also associated with increased incidence of accidents and adverse impacts on human health .  
The third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was cited , which underscored that human activities are affecting the Earths climate , with potentially significant ecological and economic effects , and that it would be necessary to understand the interrelationships between transportation systems , technology and local and global atmospheric effects as the way forward is being planned . 
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
It was noted that international development cooperation has a decisive role to play in enhancing the trade competitiveness of developing countries through the development , transfer and assimilation of technology ; promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises ; strengthening of financial systems ; development of highly qualified human resources ; and improvement of public school systems , especially in the areas of formal and non-formal vocational training . 
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
Note with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be victims of varied , evolving and sophisticated contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular nationals of different origins , migrant workers , asylum-seekers , refugees and foreigners ;  
Express our deep concern that the socio-economic development of our continent is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
Express our firm conviction that the development of democratic systems of government in Africa , which guarantee full access and representation of all sectors of our societies , respect for and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , equitable distribution of wealth and access to economic advancement , active promotion of peace , preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution and an equitable international economic environment , is an essential prerequisite for the prevention of conflicts and instability in Africa ;  
Reaffirm that the discriminatory treatment of foreigners and migrant workers established or practised in certain countries , inter alia concerning granting visas , work permits , conditions of family members , housing and access to justice , based on race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin , are human rights violations which seriously contradict the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families ;  
Affirm that the first logical and credible step to be taken at this juncture of our collective struggle is for the World Conference to declare solemnly that the international community as a whole fully recognizes the historical injustices of the slave trade and that colonialism and apartheid are among the most serious and massive institutionalized forms of human rights violations ;  
Recall that article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination already contains the obligation to provide effective protection and remedies for everyone against any acts of racial discrimination which violate human rights and fundamental freedoms , a principle reaffirmed by numerous subsequent human rights instruments including the basic principles and guidelines on the right to a remedy and reparation for victims of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Also strongly reaffirm that as a pressing requirement of justice , victims of human rights violations as a result of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should be assured effective protection and remedies as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage as a result of violations in the implementation of human rights standards ;  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism .  
This will generally require basic policies relating to areas such as the balance between public - and private-sector control of such technologies , cooperation with other countries in technical and legal matters and the balance between the application of basic human rights such as the freedom of expression and privacy rights and the effective regulation of the technologies to maximize the benefits derived from them .  
The international community should also assist the small developing economies to overcome their constraints , such as lack of financial , technical and human resources , in applying WTO consistent anti-dumping actions against injurious imports , including through institutional capacity-building , assistance in the elaboration of legislation and the setting up of investigation authorities .  
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
Gravely concerned at the persistent violation by Israel of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as the grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto .  
She outlined a number of initiatives under way : at global management meetings , human resources issues were always on the agenda ; an Intranet site on staff morale had been established , which encouraged free and open dialogue ; the services of ombudspersons were being used to a greater extent ; and joint workshops for programme and operations staff were being held .  
The review sought to examine programme objectives and strategies aimed at reducing social disparities and gaps in basic human development , through integrated demonstration programmes , including basic social services ( primary education , health , water and sanitation ) , and to assess the institutional capacity-building for local management and decision-making , as well as community participation .  
Recalling that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , peace , democracy , justice , equality , rule of law , pluralism , development , better standards of living and solidarity ,  
Expresses its deep conviction that a social order able to guarantee the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms can only be founded on a democratic society based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic and cultural system and on the peoples full participation in all aspects of their lives , and characterized by equity , social justice and non-discrimination ;  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Urges all States to foster a democracy that , inspired by the recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family , promotes peoples welfare , rejecting all forms of discrimination and exclusion , facilitates development with equity and justice , and encourages the most comprehensive and full participation of their citizens in the decision-making process and in the debate over diverse issues affecting society ;  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Although recent advances in genetic research have made it possible to identify the genetic origin of the diseases affecting human beings and to develop prevention and early detection strategies , this same genetic information can also be used to establish new parameters for classifying individuals on the basis of their genetic quality , which undoubtedly will have unpredictable consequences for individual economic , social , cultural and professional development . 
Considers it intolerable that 826-million people , most of them women and children , throughout the world and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically fragile areas ;  
Welcoming the commitment made by heads of State and Government in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to make the right to development a reality for everyone and their resolve to create an environment - at the national and global levels alike - which is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty , and their commitment to spare no effort to promote good governance and democracy and to strengthen the rule of law as well as respect for all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development ,  
Recognizes that in order to realize the right to development , national action and international cooperation must reinforce each other in a manner that goes beyond the measures for realizing each individual right , and also recognizes that international cooperation for the realization of the right to development should be conducted in a spirit of a partnership , in full respect of all human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated ;  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;  
Recognizes , while bearing in mind the existing efforts in this respect , the importance of evaluating the impact of international financial , economic , monetary and multilateral trading systems on the enjoyment of human rights , while noting that issues such as those listed below are obstacles to the full realization of the right to development :  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Stresses the crucial role of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement and underlines the obligations of all parties under the Peace Agreement to act in accordance with international human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law , and to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including civil and political rights ;  
Reiterates its call upon all States and parties to the Peace Agreement to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and effective , functioning democratic institutions will be central elements in developing civilian structures consistent with the territorial integrity of all States in the region , within their internationally recognized borders , taking fully into account all relevant Security Council resolutions ;  
Further welcomes the commitment of , and encourages efforts by , the new democratic Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to investigate past abuses of human rights , including violations of human rights of individuals belonging to ethnic groups in Kosovo ; repression and harassment of peaceful political activists ; illegal and / or hidden detentions ; and other violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire situation in Iraq , which affects the population , in particular children , as stated in the reports of several United Nations human rights treaty bodies , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
Gravely concerned at the persistent violation by Israel of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as the grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto ,  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Through its constructive partnerships with Government authorities and civil society at the local and national levels , the Human Rights Division of UNOA is actively helping to create sustainable mechanisms and processes that contribute to enabling institutions to protect human rights and for Angolans to know and exercise them .  These partnerships involve various activities and projects that are almost exclusively funded through voluntary contributions .  
How was it possible for children to fully enjoy their rights to education , to a healthy childhood , to play and recreation , and to healthy development in other words , all the rights to which they were entitled as human beings when they were confronted daily with the appalling consequences of armed conflict and foreign occupation , when they lacked even the most basic needs and when their very protection and survival were at stake ?  
Despite the existence of an array of international legal instruments to protect children in armed conflict , the human rights of children continued to be violated with impunity ; there was clearly a need to reverse the trend from blatant disregard to strict observance of those instruments .  
Deeply concerned at continued reports of widespread violence against civilians and on alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , torture , arbitrary detentions , ad hoc detention locations and continued abuses and harassment at checkpoints by Russian State agents in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation ,  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
Reiterates its call upon the Russian Federation to establish , according to recognized international standards , a national broad-based and independent commission of inquiry to investigate promptly alleged violations of human rights and breaches of international humanitarian law committed in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation in order to establish the truth and identify those responsible , with a view to bringing them to justice and preventing impunity ;  
Expresses serious concern over the slow pace of investigating alleged serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed by federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians and notes with concern that very few such cases have reached the judicial system ;  
Calls upon the Russian Federation to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors offices undertake systematic , credible and exhaustive criminal investigations and prosecutions of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights , in particular of those members of federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians allegedly implicated in war crimes and human rights violations and to pursue with rigour the cases which have been referred to them ;  
Urges the relevant authorities to take all necessary measures to avoid and limit the most cruel forms of corporal punishment in particular by applying alternative punishment and taking into account attenuating circumstances to the maximum extent possible provided for in national legislation and consistent with international human rights norms and standards ;  
Welcomes the report submitted by the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights , to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 56 ) , commends the independent expert for his valuable work and encourages him to continue studying these issues further ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all their forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and the rule of law and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of the State ;  
Recalls that international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social and cultural character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is one of the purposes of the United Nations , and affirms that wider international cooperation would contribute to lasting progress in implementing economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,  
Also encourages Governments , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , international agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide judges , lawyers , political and other public officials , community leaders and other concerned persons , as appropriate , with information and human rights education concerning womens equal ownership of , access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing ;  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of United Nations peacekeeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , as well as to other pertinent international instruments ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with the mandate of the High Commissioner established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
April 2001 , endorses the Commissions decision to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions for three years , and approves the Commissions request to the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with an adequate and stable level of human , financial and material resources in order to enable her to continue to carry out her mandate effectively , including through country visits .  
Recalling that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , peace , democracy , justice , equality , rule of law , pluralism , development , better standards of living and solidarity ,  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Urges all States to foster a democracy that , inspired by the recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family , promotes peoples welfare , rejecting all forms of discrimination and exclusion , facilitates development with equity and justice , and encourages the most comprehensive and full participation of their citizens in the decision-making process and in the debate over diverse issues affecting society ;  
Global Education Associates ( GEA ) is an association of individual and institutional associates in more than 90 countries , working to advance global systems that will ensure ecological integrity , peace , human rights , economic and social well-being , and democratic participation , with special care to include the voices and perspectives of poor and marginalized people of diverse cultural and religious traditions . 
Good governance , according to article 9 of the Cotonou agreement signed by all 77 ACP countries and the EU , implies a political and institutional environment that upholds human rights , democratic principles , the rule of law , and the transparent and accountable management of human , natural , economic and financial resources .  
To include all IPF / IFF proposals for action in the plan of action is perhaps neither feasible nor practical considering the short initial time-horizon of UNFF , as well as the limited financial , human , scientific and technical resources available for implementation .  
The programme , by facilitating greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , on adopting a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on adopting more efficient methods of preventing human rights violations and removing obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
The programme of work aims at the adoption and implementation of an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the right to development , a significant enhancement of support for that right from relevant United Nations bodies and a significant increase in the recognition of economic , social and cultural rights as human rights and their integration into the strategies and programmes of international organizations , agencies and financial and developmental institutions .  
The programme further aims at reinforcing the role of the United Nations as the unique worldwide forum for the discussion and resolution , with the participation of all relevant actors , of human rights matters of international concern , through its support for human rights bodies and organs and its adoption and progressive implementation of an improved treaty monitoring system , which deals with multiple reporting obligations and is based on a comprehensive national approach .  
Other areas of work that will receive special attention include : effective education and public information programmes ; strengthened contribution of non-governmental organizations , national institutions , grass-roots organizations and other relevant elements of civil society in United Nations human rights activities at all levels , according to the legislative mandates in effect regarding those issues ; effective human rights field activities and operations ; and support for the implementation of a strengthened system of special procedures based on harmonization and rationalization of work .  
Reaffirming its commitment to the process of democratization of States , and recognizing that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Reaffirming that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Encourages the continuing efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reduce the prison population by releasing minors , elderly prisoners , prisoners suffering from terminal illness and suspects with incomplete files who were detained for their alleged involvement in genocide and other abuses of human rights , urges the Government of Rwanda to accelerate these efforts and reaffirms the urgent need to complete a dossier for every detainee with a view to identifying those who should be released immediately , early or conditionally , while expressing concern at the high number of detainees still awaiting trial ;  
A report completed by MONUC human rights officers indicates that the above agreement is being respected but concludes that , unless actions are undertaken by the international community to diffuse tension , further violent and uncontrolled confrontations can be expected .  
The Secretary-General remains cognizant of the fact that , in order to be held accountable for discharging their responsibilities , managers need to have authority and control over their human and financial resources , timely and accurate information about the status of the resources assigned to them and training , as required .  
In this context , human resources directors meet prior to the sessions of the International Civil Service Commission to review matters under consideration by the Commission , appoint spokespersons to represent the executive heads of the participating organizations at the Commission sessions and put forward common positions on the relevant issues under consideration .  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , in the personnel and general administration areas the High-level Committee on Management will place emphasis on human resources management and reform of the common system by continuing specific studies covering the role and function of the international civil service and its underpinnings , the development of a senior management cadre , the further development of system-wide standards on contractual patterns and employment conditions and the implications of other management reforms , such as downsizing and outsourcing , for the participating organizations .  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Welcoming the commitment made by heads of State and Government in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to make the right to development a reality for everyone and their resolve to create an environment - at the national and global levels alike - which is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty , and their commitment to spare no effort to promote good governance and democracy and to strengthen the rule of law as well as respect for all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development ,  
Recognizes that in order to realize the right to development , national action and international cooperation must reinforce each other in a manner that goes beyond the measures for realizing each individual right , and also recognizes that international cooperation for the realization of the right to development should be conducted in a spirit of a partnership , in full respect of all human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated ;  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;  
Requests the independent expert to prepare , in consultation with all relevant United Nations agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions , a preliminary study on the impact of these issues on the enjoyment of human rights , starting by analysing the existing efforts and means of assessing and evaluating such an impact , for consideration by the Working Group at its future sessions ;  
Condemns violence against women committed in situations of armed conflict , such as murder , rape , including systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , and calls for effective responses to these violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ,  
Encourages the continuing efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reduce the prison population by releasing minors , elderly prisoners , prisoners suffering from terminal illness and suspects with incomplete files who were detained for their alleged involvement in genocide and other abuses of human rights , urges the Government of Rwanda to accelerate these efforts and reaffirms the urgent need to complete a dossier for every detainee with a view to identifying those who should be released immediately , early or conditionally , while expressing concern at the high number of detainees still awaiting trial ,  
The Commission recalls the commitment of the Government of Indonesia to ensure that the violations of human rights and humanitarian law committed during the violence in 1999 are accounted for and welcomes in this context the concrete steps already taken by the Government of Indonesia , including the efforts by the Attorney-General of Indonesia to investigate fully the violations of human rights and international and humanitarian law perpetrated in East Timor in the period leading up to and immediately following the popular consultation held in August 1999 .  
Recognizing also that accountability of individual perpetrators of grave human rights violations is one of the central elements of any effective remedy for victims of human rights violations and a key factor in ensuring a fair and equitable justice system and , ultimately , reconciliation and stability within a State ,  
Considers it intolerable that 826-million people , most of them women and children , throughout the world and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically fragile areas ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Welcomes the report submitted by the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights , to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 56 ) , commends the independent expert for his valuable work and encourages him to continue studying these issues further ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
Recalls that international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social and cultural character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is one of the purposes of the United Nations , and affirms that wider international cooperation would contribute to lasting progress in implementing economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,  
Also encourages Governments , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , international agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide judges , lawyers , political and other public officials , community leaders and other concerned persons , as appropriate , with information and human rights education concerning womens equal ownership of , access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing ;  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to continue to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Calls upon all States to take all necessary measures to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by children with disabilities and , where necessary , to develop and enforce legislation against their discrimination to ensure dignity , promote self-reliance and facilitate the childs active participation in the community , including adequate and effective access to education of good quality for children with disabilities and their parents , taking into account the situation of children with disabilities living in poverty ;  
It is saddening that at the dawn of the twenty-first century and the strides that humanity has made in constructing a new international environment , where respect for international law and legality and full protection of human rights constitute the cornerstone of the policy of States , the Turkish Republic continues to behave in a manner reminiscent of some of the worst periods of the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries , with an anachronistic approach in its relations with its neighbours based on threats and the use of force . 
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Express our conviction that political platforms based on racism , xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and discrimination must be condemned as incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance , and that racial discrimination condoned by governmental policies violates human rights and may endanger friendly relations among peoples , cooperation among nations , and international peace and security ;  
Urge States to reaffirm their democratic commitment and take the necessary legislative , administrative and judicial measures , in accordance with their obligations under regional and international human rights instruments , to condemn and actively discourage all forms of propaganda , publicity , organizations , associations , political parties or groups inspired by ideas or theories of the superiority of one race or ethnic group and that seek to justify or promote racial hatred , xenophobia or racial discrimination ;  
Urge States to give priority to promoting and protecting the full and equal enjoyment by women and men of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction of any kind as to race , colour , gender , sexual orientation , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
Stress that education and training programmes , as well as other social policies , should promote more inclusive societies , encouraging stable and harmonious relationships and friendships between different nations , peoples and groups , fostering mutual understanding , solidarity , tolerance , development of a culture of peace , the study of the Holocaust and injustice against indigenous peoples and people of African descent in the Americas , social justice and respect for human rights for all ;  
Encourage all relevant actors to intensify their efforts at the national , regional and international levels , especially by means of education , to ensure that children are educated from an early age in those values , attitudes and ways of conduct and life that will allow them to resolve conflicts of a racial or ethnic character peacefully , in a spirit of respect for human dignity , tolerance and non-discrimination ;  
Request States to make a serious commitment to adopting more appropriate measures to ( a ) combat illegal acts motivated by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance against individuals , communities or groups of persons ; ( b ) protect victims of discrimination and provide them with security against future threats ; ( c ) punish those responsible for such crimes and violations of human rights ; and ( d ) make every effort to ensure that national and local public authorities act accordingly ;  
As stated in its resolution 1291 ( 2000 ) of 24 February 2000 , the Security Council , inter alia , authorized MONUC to consist of political , human rights , humanitarian affairs , public information , child protection and medical and administrative support components .  
This proposal is based on current UNDP programmes concerned with the rule of law and comprises five main goals : ( a ) national capacity-building in the judicial sphere ; ( b ) support to the participatory process of judicial reform ; ( c ) improved access to justice ; ( d ) consolidation of institution-building in the main bodies responsible for public security , the Haitian National Police and the Prison Authority ; and ( e ) national capacity-building in the area of respect for and promotion of human rights .  
This encompasses a broad and balanced approach , placing equal emphasis on all human rights civil and political , economic , social and cultural , as well as the right to development .  
The suffering of Palestinian children caused by Israeli acts of aggression aimed at killing and maiming children , coupled with the lack of facilities to shelter them , Israels abandonment of all values and human rights and its flouting of all international instruments , and its refusal to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to establish a just peace in accordance with the legitimate decisions of the international community , causing heightened suffering among the Arab population under occupation and denying their children all the rights enshrined in the precepts of God and humanitarian law .  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
The Executive Heads acknowledged that , while non-governmental organizations were one of a range of instruments of transparency and outreach available to the system , they have been key partners of the system in balancing country-specific interests , and advancing , at both the national and the international levels , the United Nations systems economic , social and human rights agenda .  
They especially appreciated the fact that the concept put forward by the Secretary-General that we must put people at the centre of everything we do was strongly reflected in the United Nations Millennium Declaration ; the Summits reference to the United Nations as the indispensable common house of the entire human family ; and its wish to make the United Nations system a more vital and effective tool in the hands of all the worlds peoples .  
Agencies will thus provide their technical expertise according to their respective mandates following the themes of the round tables : HIV / AIDS prevention and care ; HIV / AIDS and human rights ; the social and economic impact of the epidemic and the strengthening of national capacities to combat HIV / AIDS ; and international funding and cooperation to address the challenges of the AIDS epidemic .  
The attitude of the Congolese people , as reflected by a wide range of civil society organizations , religious groups and opposition political parties whom the Council mission met in Kinshasa and elsewhere , suggests that the country is eager to move forward towards national reconciliation , democratization and development , with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in a climate of political plurality .  
The key tasks were : to ensure security during the transitional period and arrangements for East Timors post-independence security ; to establish a credible system of justice in which fundamental human rights are respected ; to achieve a reasonable level of reconstruction of public services and infrastructure ; to establish an administration that is financially sustainable ; and to manage a political transition to independence , culminating in the adoption of a constitution and democratic elections ( see S / 2000 / 738 , para .  68 ) .  
UNTAET essentially faced many challenges with regard to public administration , among which was , first , the rapid establishment of a functioning administrative apparatus within a context of decimated human and material infrastructure , and second , moving East Timorese into positions of responsibility as soon and as much as possible to create a sustainable East Timorese administration ( Timorization ) .  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .  
In the relevant letters addressed to you on a regular basis by its Minister for Foreign Affairs , Iraq has always stressed that the logistic support provided to the Americans and British by Kuwait makes that country a partner in the aggression committed against Iraq and that it thus incurs international responsibility under international law , including liability for full compensation for the losses and damage , in both human and material terms , that are caused by this aggression .  
Noting that the effective functioning of national TCDC focal points and the full utilization of the TCDC modality , require , inter alia , adequate financial and human resources , as well as international support ,  
As development thinking shifts towards sustainable human development and parallel good governance and economic development , South-South initiatives are required to move easily from technical collaboration to joint efforts in social and economic development .  
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
In the light of the International Bill of Rights , poverty may be defined as a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
While poverty raises complex multisectoral issues that are not amenable to simple solutions , the application of the international human rights normative framework to these issues helps to ensure that essential elements of anti-poverty strategies such as non-discrimination , equality , participation and accountability receive the sustained attention they deserve .  
In conclusion , anti-poverty policies are more likely to be effective , sustainable , inclusive , equitable and meaningful to those living in poverty if they are based upon international human rights .  
The challenge of building functioning institutions safeguarding fundamental human rights and capable of supporting a multi-ethnic society based on democratic principles and tolerance is a major one .  
The development of an indigenous technological base will provide developing countries with the knowledge and skills necessary for the optimal use of their own human and natural resources and help in devising the production techniques relevant to their development strategies and cultural milieu .  
I am also concerned at the deterioration in public security , reflected in an increase in crime , in actions by armed criminal groups and in the continuing very serious threats against persons involved in criminal proceedings and intimidation of members of non-governmental human rights organizations .  
Although it was reported at the end of December 2000 that the Executive Director had delegated programme managerial responsibilities to ODCCP programme managers and that they would be held accountable for the implementation of programme activities and the efficient use of human and financial resources , at the time of the inspection OIOS found no documentary evidence specifying the parameters of such delegation and the mechanism of accountability .  
The Workshop underlined the importance of indigenous media as an indispensable tool to promote indigenous identity , language , culture , self-representation and collective and human rights , and as a vehicle for communicating international , regional and national issues to indigenous communities as well as conveying community concerns to a wider public .  
Article 55 of the Charter explicitly recognizes that solutions to international economic , social , health and related problems , international , cultural and educational cooperation and universal respect for human rights are all essential for the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
In 1997 , as part of my programme for reform , I established a structure of four executive committees at the Under-Secretary-General level to act as internal decision-making mechanisms for the five main areas of concern : peace and security ; economic and social affairs ; development cooperation ; humanitarian affairs ; and human rights as a cross-cutting theme .  
Examples of this include improving support for democratic principles such as a fair role for the opposition , equitable access to public media , security sector reform , promoting tolerance and respect for human rights and providing technical assistance for the constitution and national institutions .  
Efforts to prevent armed conflict should promote a broad range of human rights , including not only civil and political rights but also economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
This implies an increased focus on issues like good governance at national and international levels and the fight against corruption , respect for all internationally recognized human rights , gender issues , capacity and institutional building , social services supply and environmental concerns .  The majority of the poor live in rural areas .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
At its forty-seventh session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1995 / 31 , endorsed the background document of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 11 ) and requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on the impact of the activities and working methods of transnational corporations on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , bearing in mind existing international guidelines , rules and standards relating to the subject matter .  
The Sub-Commission decided , in response to the request from the Commission , and since this subject required careful and comprehensive inquiry , to appoint Mr . Oloka-Onyango and Ms . Udagama as Special Rapporteurs with the task of preparing a study on the issue of globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , and requested the Special Rapporteurs to submit a preliminary report to the Sub-Commission at its fifty-second session .  
HIV / AIDS is now a classic , modern health issue , closely connected with individual and collective human behaviour , strongly influenced by broad social and economic forces and linked particularly closely to social discrimination .  
In the Millennium Declaration , the heads of State and Government of the States Members of the United Nations pledged to spare no effort to free our fellow men , women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty , to which more than a-billion of them are currently subjected and expressed their commitment to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want ( General Assembly resolution 55 / 2 of 8 September 2000 , para . 
In 2001 , OHCHR has also assisted the independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty in the preparation and conduct of her mission to Bolivia to assess the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes and strategies by meeting with government officials , representatives of non-governmental organizations and poor peoples associations , as well as United Nations and international financial organizations in the country .  
The expert seminar acknowledged the need for a new text that would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of poverty , and in particular extreme poverty , that would clarify definitional issues through the multidimensional nature of poverty in the light of human rights , and that would set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
In May 2001 , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights adopted a statement on poverty which recognizes that poverty constitutes a denial of human rights and defines poverty as a human condition characterized by the deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ( A / CONF . 191 / BP / 7 ) .  
This does not guarantee that particular measures of affirmative action will survive all constitutional challenges , but the propriety of affirmative action under international treaty law of the United States and related duties provide compelling State interests and can contribute to a continuing or evolving meaning of the Constitution compatible with generally shared values and human dignity .  
Moreover , a genuine operation is under way to influence world opinion in order to accomplish unacknowledged goals : continuing to occupy Congolese territory , massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , pillage and illegal exploitation of Congolese resources .  
Deeply concerned that the global HIV / AIDS epidemic , through its devastating scale and impact , constitutes a global emergency and one of the most formidable challenges to human life and dignity , as well as to the effective enjoyment of human rights , which undermines social and economic development throughout the world and affects all levels of society national , community , family and individual ;  
Recognizing the fundamental importance of strengthening national , regional and subregional capacities to address and effectively combat HIV / AIDS and that this will require increased and sustained human , financial and technical resources through strengthened national action and cooperation and increased regional , subregional and international cooperation ;  
Protecting public health and nutrition , protecting the environment , encouraging technology transfer , advancing socio-economic development as stated in article 7 of the TRIPS Agreement , and promoting fairness and international cooperation are measures that - at least in theory - are conducive to the promotion and protection of human rights and the balance sought under article 15 .  
In resolution 1999 / 26 of 26 August 1999 , the Sub-Commission expressed its deep appreciation and thanks to the Special Rapporteur for her excellent and comprehensive preliminary report and requested the Secretary-General to transmit this report to Governments , specialized agencies and concerned intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations with the request that they submit to the Special Rapporteur as soon as possible comments , information and data relating to the study on terrorism and human rights .  
Its main purpose is to move ahead and explore other priority areas touched upon in the earlier documents prepared by the Special Rapporteur , namely the problem of definition and of the actors involved in the exercise or use of terrorist activity , the development of new forms of terrorism and the probability of mass destruction terrorism and , finally , a number of issues associated with the consequences of terrorism for human rights .  
It reiterated its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for economic and social development .  
It is , moreover , well-understood that the illegal use of force in international relations will be considered under customary international law , international human rights and humanitarian law , the law of armed conflict and international criminal law .  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
In similar fashion , better efforts should be made to achieve improved relations between States , not only because this is mandated in the Charter , but also because it is viewed as essential to the global realization of human rights as indicated in article 28 of the Universal Declaration : quite clearly an international order that is generating terrorist acts hardly qualifies as a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in th [ e ] Declaration can be fully realized . 
We recognize and admit that slavery and the slave trade , other forms of servitude , conquest and colonialism were the primary sources and manifestation / a source of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and condemn the injustices that were committed , especially against Africans , people of African descent and indigenous peoples and stress the need for all States which were engaged in such practices to acknowledge the grave human suffering they caused and the heinous racist acts committed ;  
We affirm that slavery , particularly of Africans and their descendants , and especially the transatlantic slave trade , was a unique and appalling tragedy in the history of humanity and a crime against humanity , not only because of its abhorrent barbarism , but also in terms of its enormous magnitude , its institutionalized nature , its transnational dimension and especially its negation of the very essence of the human nature of its victims ;  
We express our deep concern that socio-economic development is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
Refugees and displaced persons already for many years have been deprived of elementary living conditions and the exercise of the most fundamental human rights and freedoms , enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , including the right to live in dignity and safety and participate fully in social and economic life in their places of permanent residence .  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
We firmly believe that education , development and the faithful implementation of our international human rights norms / obligations , including enactment of laws and political , social and economic policies , are crucial to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We express deep concern about the use of new information technologies , such as the Internet , for purposes contrary to respect for human values , equality , non-discrimination , respect for others and tolerance , including to propagate racism , racial hatred , xenophobia , racial discrimination and related intolerance , and that children and youth have access to this material ; others / [ respect and tolerance for diversity ] ; [ and urge their continued and enhanced use in this respect ; ] .  
We recognize that quality education , the elimination of illiteracy and access to free general education for all should promote more inclusive societies , equity , stable and harmonious relations and friendship between nations , peoples and groups , and a culture of peace , fostering mutual understanding , solidarity , social justice and respect for the human rights of all ;  
Stress that education and training programmes , as well as other social policies , should promote more inclusive societies , encouraging stable and harmonious relationships and friendships between different nations , peoples and groups , fostering mutual understanding , solidarity , tolerance , the development of a culture of peace , the study of the Holocaust and injustice against indigenous peoples and people of African descent in the Americas , social justice and respect for human rights for all ;  
Urges States , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to take steps to improve access to public information on health and environmental issues by all people , including those affected by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; identify and address the adverse effects of government policies and programmes on the human health and environment in targeted areas ; and promote compliance with and enforcement of all health and environmental laws , including in areas inhabited by racial or ethnic minorities , indigenous peoples , or low-income populations ;  
In this regard , it is important to introduce and , as applicable , to reinforce an / the anti-discrimination and anti-racism components / into human rights programmes in school curricula , to develop relevant educational material and to ensure that all teachers are effectively trained and adequately motivated to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns , etc .  / of the school curricula and to improve educational materials on human rights and anti-racism , in order to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns based on the principles of non-discrimination , mutual respect and tolerance ;  
Calls upon Calls uponStrongly recommends to participating States to introduce , or encourage the introduction of , or reinforce , human rights education , including promoting anti-racism , with a view to combating prejudices which lead to racial discrimination and to promoting understanding , tolerance and friendship between different racial or ethnic groups in school curricula and in institutions of higher education and to support public formal and non-formal education programmes designed to promote cultural diversity and self-esteem of vulnerable groups ;  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism ;  
Action is required at all levels national , regional and worldwide and in many areas : disarmament , peacekeeping and peace-building , combating organized crime , ensuring the responsibility of producer and consumer States , without forgetting the need , in parallel , to pursue the whole range of actions to prevent and combat the underlying causes of conflicts .  For the moment , a single aim must nevertheless inspire us , that of responding to the problem of human suffering and insecurity .  
Many years had to elapse and great human and material resources had to be expended for the world to realize something that should have been an obvious truth ; that the early identification of trends leading to crises and the timely forestalling of their development into armed clashes are much more effective in every respect than extinguishing conflicts in their heated phase .  
The Board also took into consideration in its selection that the Group had decided to keep under consideration at its twenty-sixth session the question of debt bondage , the role of corruption in the perpetuation of slavery and slavery-like practices , problems affecting migrant workers , the protection of child labourers , forced labour , trafficking in human organs and tissues , forced marriages , ways to combat sexual abuse of children inside the family , and the urgent need for adequate help to be offered to victims of such practices .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
India pointed to the urgent need for a comprehensive study on the impact of terrorism on the enjoyment of human rights , in view of the continuing acts of terrorism despite international and national efforts , and the still confused and inconclusive debate on the issue .  
In the field of human rights , the ILO has continued to collaborate with other international organizations on issues such as freedom of association , discrimination in employment and occupation , equal opportunities of men and women in employment , indigenous and tribal peoples , migrant workers , forced labour , child labour , and other questions falling within the mandate of ILO .  
Because of common purposes and objectives ( education and training ) , similar geographic and human target areas , similar operational modes and strategies and a common institutional location , there are large areas of synergetic opportunity between the programmes : funding , management and execution , cost rationalization - let alone the added value of a comprehensive and integrated approach to commercial and logistic manpower requirements .  
The Special Committee therefore regards this regional seminar as a critical first step in this second International Decade , as we proceed to devise international strategies in a concerted effort to ensure that this sacred right to self-determination , this basic human right , is realized in all of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , so that the people might achieve their full political equality consistent with recognized international standards . 
In the above-mentioned resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on human rights and cultural diversity , taking into account the views of Member States , relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , as well as the considerations in the resolution regarding the recognition and importance of cultural diversity among all peoples ; and decided to continue consideration of the question at its fifty-sixth session under the item entitled Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It implies a commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the rights of groups that are disadvantaged or victims of discrimination and persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and cultural minorities to have free access to the expression of their own culture and that of others .  
There is no choice therefore but to condemn and demand the immediate repeal of laws of this kind adopted by the Government of the United States of America , such as the so-called Helms-Burton Act and the Torricelli Act , which are a direct attack on the enjoyment of human rights by the Cuban people , are incompatible with World Trade Organization ( WTO ) agreements and undermine ongoing efforts to make the multilateral trading system more equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable .  
Also urges States to protect the privacy of those subject to genetic testing and to ensure that genetic testing is done with the prior , free , informed and express consent of the individual or authorization obtained in the manner prescribed by law and in accordance with public international law and the international law of human rights ;  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
The definition tries to capture the dimension of human suffering that is missing from many formal descriptions of food insecurity : the unbearable , nagging dread that tortures starving persons from the moment they wake up .  How , during the day that lies ahead , will they be able to feed their family , provide nourishment for their children and feed themselves ?  
The terrible dimension of human suffering , so often missing from formal descriptions of food insecurity , is the unbearable , nagging dread that tortures undernourished persons from the moment they wake up .  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
Convinced that human rights education and information is in the best interests of particularly vulnerable segments of society , such as children , youth , women , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with HIV / AIDs and disabled persons ,  
The Unit otherwise supports the work of NGOs by disseminating international human rights promotional and training material and developing a mechanism through which information collated and analysed by the Unit and East Timorese NGOs will be preserved and accessible for future use .  
Noting with grave concern that despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination had not been attained , the General Assembly decided that the World Conference would be action-oriented and focus on practical measures to eradicate racism , including measures of prevention , education and protection and the provision of effective remedies , taking into full consideration the existing human rights instruments .  
Also urges States to protect the privacy of those subject to genetic testing and to ensure that genetic testing is done with the prior , free , informed and express consent of the individual or authorization obtained in the manner prescribed by law and in accordance with public international law and the international law of human rights ;  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
That being so , although at one time the definition was considered to be a first step , the current tendency is to describe it as partial , inadequate , applying only to international conflicts and inapplicable to new approaches such as the one involving the criminal responsibility of artificial persons ( private security firms ) that hire and employ mercenaries who violate human rights .  
All this may give rise to interference by mercenaries who , motivated by payment , may commit terrorist acts , attacks against persons , cultural objects or economic facilities , engage in illicit trafficking , or provoke armed or other conflicts with a view to carrying out violent and destabilizing assignments which have a profound impact on the enjoyment of human rights .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the prevailing rules of international humanitarian law and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the supreme chief of the Taliban , asking him not to issue the decree because of its discriminatory nature and stressing that measures designed to protect minorities must be consistent with the relevant international human rights standards , which were based on the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of religion or belief .  
The Preparatory Committee drew up a list of participants in the conference , including all Member States of the United Nations and observers , the various related components of the United Nations secretariat , specialized agencies , UNESCO chairs in the field of human rights and interreligious dialogue , treaty and non-treaty human rights mechanisms regional organizations , international organizations of an educational or cultural nature , national and regional human rights institutes , national human rights commissions , and experts from religious or confessional groups and non-governmental organizations .  
With a view to achieving deeper cooperation and better mutual understanding and to promoting the exchange of expertise , the Special Rapporteur decided to invite to the Madrid conference United Nations human rights mechanisms ( such as those relating to special procedures , treaty monitoring bodies and national human rights institutions ) , as well as United Nations specialized agencies concerned with questions of education and freedom of religion or belief .  
One might therefore consider that action for the promotion of human rights should involve , on the one hand , action for the establishment , consolidation and protection of democracy , as an expression of human rights on the political level , and , on the other , action aimed at limiting and reducing extreme poverty and promoting the rights of individuals and peoples to development , as an expression of human rights and of economic , social and cultural solidarity among human beings .  
It is at that level that , most immediately , priorities can be identified , successful and flexible response strategies determined ( including through international cooperation ) and assistance given to States , in the human rights context and within the international and regional human rights frameworks .  
These should be , and in many cases are already being , applied by national Governments ( including in developing their international policies and objectives ) to ensure , through exercising good governance , that their citizens are involved in decision-making , that their citizens rights are protected and that all areas of government are sensitized to human rights obligations and goals .  
Moreover there is the danger that by increasing the inequalities between rich and poor countries , globalization may render the exercise of the most elementary and fundamental human rights illusory in the least developed countries , whose numbers have grown steadily since 1990 and whose economic situation has steadily deteriorated , further pauperizing a population already sorely tried by various disasters .  
There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
To promote and defend human rights it is essential , in this regard , to promote equitable trade among nations , to establish a minimum of control in commercial exchanges , to reorient globalization and focus more on the human being rather than on profit , to strengthen regional integration processes as a shield against the disastrous effects of globalization and to break the vicious circle of indebtedness of developing countries .  
In that regard , Finland has actively supported the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative with the aim to have the developing countries commit themselves to the exercise of sustainable economic policies , alleviation of poverty and respect for human rights in return for a reduced debt burden .  
Those rights concern historical , cultural and ethnic identity , the juridical identity of indigenous communities , communal possession of traditional lands , bilingual and intercultural education , the preservation of indigenous heritage , measures to promote human development and participation in the management of their natural resources .  6 .  Argentina has established a National Institute against Discrimination , Xenophobia and Racism , a decentralized body within the framework of the Ministry of the Interior .  
Even though the right to development as set out in the 1986 Declaration was reaffirmed in the 1993 Vienna Declaration as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , several industrialized countries are now attempting to question and reformulate its content and scope , including the definition of the beneficiaries of the right .  
The Government of the Republic of Cuba is confident that human solidarity and social justice will prevail over the selfish and unjust concepts underpinning the current international economic order , which are aggravated by the neo-liberal theories imposed by the current process of globalization .  
Training programmes and discussions aimed at both rural women and men to promote gender awareness should be organized by national and local governments , human rights groups and other non-governmental organizations in order to encourage the sharing of parental roles and domestic duties by men .  
Following the establishment of the Republic of Yemen in 1990 , which ushered in an era of democratization and active civil institutions , the number of non-governmental organizations and institutions engaged in activities relating to the protection and promotion of human rights in general or focusing on a particular field , such as political , civil , economic or cultural rights or protection of the rights of a specific section of society , such as women , children or the disabled , increased considerably and currently amounts to about 2,000 .  
The principal objectives of the Network are to expand mutual support , cooperation and joint activities , including through information exchanges , training and development , undertaking joint projects , sharing expertise , periodical regional meetings and seminars , and mutually assisting each other with respect to requests from other national institutions regarding human rights violations .  
The Special Adviser attended the seventh annual Congress of the International Ombudsperson Institute held in Durban , South Africa , from 30 October to 2 November 2000 , where the participating Ombudspersons and national institutions agreed that living in a society that pursues good governance practices is a basic human right .  59 .  An increasing number of national institutions take the opportunity of addressing the Commission on Human Rights in its annual sessions .  
As per the respective Commission on Human Rights resolutions , Member States of the United Nations are encouraged to continue supporting the efforts of the Office in this area and to provide additional financial resources as part of their contributions to the programme of advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights .  
Recruitment and use of child soldiers , the proliferation of small arms , the indiscriminate use of landmines , large-scale forced displacement and ethnic cleansing , the targeting of women and children , the denial of even the most basic human rights , and widespread impunity for atrocities are still all too familiar features of war .  
I urge the Security Council and the General Assembly to provide , from the outset , reliable , sufficient and sustained funding for international efforts , whether existing or future international tribunals , arrangements established in the context of United Nations peace operations , or initiatives undertaken in concert with individual Member States , to bring to justice perpetrators of grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
Concrete and verified information about massive displacements of people , security conditions , and violations of international humanitarian and human rights law can be vital for distressed populations and international aid workers alike .  Where communications are disrupted , using the media to inform distressed populations about the activities of relief agencies , and about the location of shelter , food , water and medical services , can be critical for alleviating human suffering .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
I urge the Security Council and the General Assembly to provide , from the outset , reliable , sufficient and sustained funding for international efforts , whether existing or future international tribunals , arrangements established in the context of United Nations peace operations or initiatives undertaken in concert with individual Member States , to bring to justice perpetrators of grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
At its fifty-seventh session , in April 2001 , the Commission on Human Rights adopted , without a vote , resolution 2001 / 13 on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan , in which it strongly condemned the mass killings and systematic human rights violations against civilians and persons deprived of their liberty , for reasons related to the armed conflict , resulting in the massive , forced displacement of the civilian population .  
It also noted with deep concern the continuing pattern of human rights violations in Afghanistan and the continuation of armed hostilities and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which had resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement .  
In view of the repeated massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Afghanistan , the High Commissioner called upon the international community to establish an independent international inquiry into the massacres and other grave human rights violations committed by parties to the armed conflict in Afghanistan .  
He expressed his dismay at the persistent failure of the warring parties to abide by international humanitarian norms and to hold those responsible for gross violations of human rights accountable for their actions .  
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan stated in his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session that , in order to deter and prevent the occurrence of such atrocities , an effective international initiative was needed to expose and hold to account those responsible for war crimes , breaches of international humanitarian law and gross violations of human rights .  
The previous report noted that the situation was worsening year by year , and described challenges in the area of sustainable human development resulting from the chronic instability of the countrys political , economic , social and security environment .  
Quality of life is declining in urban areas , with losses of housing and of human lives caused by erosion , siltation and flooding ; general insalubrity owing to the lack of appropriate solid and liquid waste management systems ; severe overcrowding caused both by the population explosion and by uncontrollable concentrations of population ; physical and chemical degradation of land ; pollution of all kinds ; and above all , deforestation on the periphery of urban areas . 
Finally , in cooperation with OHCHR , UNEP is organizing a seminar on environment and human rights to discuss interlinkages , common protection approaches , the special role played by some groups and their vulnerability , and proposals for future courses of action at the national and international level .  
Such projects have included peoples sensitization campaigns on indigenous people issues in Chile ; training sessions for school teachers and representatives of social groups in Chile ; the establishment of a centre in Mexico where human rights violations can be reported and which provides legal assistance to vulnerable groups , such as rural populations , street children , prisoners and people living with HIV / AIDS . France Liberts has also been advocating against the death penalty ; a CD-ROM against racism was also produced and distributed among schools and for public awareness purposes . 
The Plan of Action for the Decade provides for the establishment , upon the initiative of Governments or other relevant institutions , of national focal points or committees for human rights education , which should include a broad coalition of governmental and non-governmental actors and be responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive , effective and sustainable national plan of action for human rights education .  
When applicable , this plan should constitute an integral part of the national development plan and be complementary to other relevant national plans of action already defined ( overall human rights plans or those relating to women , children , minorities , indigenous peoples , etc . ) .  
At the national level , the Service Centre for Human Rights Education , established in 1997 , continues to provide systematic assistance and advice to school teachers on human rights issues , including the development of special projects and of a newsletter .  Anti-racism educational efforts were also reported .  
The main characteristic of the period under review has been the large number of complaints of threats , harassment and intimidation against persons and institutions working for the protection of human rights , civil servants , persons involved in judicial proceedings and journalists critical of public authorities .  
The end of the internal armed conflict and of an institutional policy that violated human rights represented a qualitative and quantitative improvement .  
It is the States inability to safeguard human rights that has made the public feel defenceless and has increased tolerance for illegal , increasingly violent phenomena such as lynchings and social cleansing .  
Although by and large , these commitments are in the form of best endeavour , they mark a significant departure from the previous two programmes of action by clearly indicating complementary actions between least developed countries and their development partners in seven areas : fostering a people-centred policy framework ; good governance at national and international levels ; building human and institutional capacities ; building productive capacities to make globalization work for least developed countries ; enhancing the role of trade in development ; reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment ; and mobilizing financial resources .  
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
The promotion of a conducive macroeconomic environment , good governance and democracy , as well as strengthening structural aspects of the economy and improved institutional and human capacities , was regarded as important also in the context of attracting FDI and other private external flows .  
The Section will be responsible for mid - and long-term planning , including succession planning , developing mission modules / templates , determining staffing tables and levels , anticipating future skills requirements , analysing and monitoring human resource trends , identifying new sources of recruitment , and managing the civilian rapid deployment capability .  
Bearing in mind also that both the legislative and oversight organs of the Organization have stressed the importance of having in place an effective monitoring mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the delegated authority for the management of human resources in peacekeeping operations , it is proposed to strengthen Cluster VI by two additional Professional ( 1 P-5 , 1-P-4 ) and one General Service ( Other level ) posts . 
Attacks against the civilian population and systematic killings and summary executions have been a part of the pattern of egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law perpetrated by different factions in the protracted armed conflict in Sierra Leone .  
To standardize police training and adapt it to the Sierra Leone environment , the Section has finalized arrangements with the UNAMSIL Civilian Police to produce a training manual for the police , internal human rights awareness training for incoming UNAMSIL peacekeepers and military observers occurs on a regular basis and the Section provided training on human rights and humanitarian law for the Pakistani Brigade in Pakistan prior to its deployment to UNAMSIL .  
In order to enable OHCHR to provide adequate , systematic and prompt substantive support and to facilitate links with the broader United Nations human rights programme , there is a need to strengthen its capacity for daily advice and substantive backstopping to the increasing number of peacekeeping operations with human rights components .  
A number of interventions recalled article 1 of the Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986 , which stated that The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
He recognized that certain development activities in the past had had negative impacts on indigenous peoples such as involuntary resettlement , restricted access to natural resources and violations of basic human rights .  
In the opinion of Qatar , the right of peoples to self-determination is one of the most important ones acquired in the field of human rights , yet ongoing occupation is unquestionably impeding the development of international economic cooperation , preventing the social and cultural advancement of peoples subjected to occupation and negating the ideal of universal peace to which the United Nations is aspiring .  
Mindful that , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Supports the Declaration on the Right to Development and underlines the multidimensional , integrated and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations on achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination or distinction as to race , colour , sex , social class , descent , national or ethnic origin , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recalling that the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups must be respected in all circumstances and that deliberate policies discriminating against women and girls in that country on the grounds of sex constitute gross and flagrant violations of the international instruments relating to human rights ,  
Stressing that , in accordance with article 27 , paragraph 2 , of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 15 , paragraph 1 ( c ) , of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the right to protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific , literary or artistic production of which one is the author is a human right , subject to limitations in the public interest ,  
In addition , Article 1 calls for achieving international cooperation to solve international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The Government of Panama , whose foreign policy is fully engaged in the development of the democratic system and respect for human rights throughout the world , believes that the continued exclusion of the Republic of China from the United Nations system is inconsistent with the principles that underlie the Organizations functioning , the commitment to the democratic system and human rights that the United Nations system proclaims and promotes , and the international realities witnessed by all the peoples of the world .  
After so many years of fruitless endeavours , the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations , in particular the Security Council , might wish to consider adopting a comprehensive approach to the settlement of Afghanistan , in its political , military , humanitarian and human rights dimensions , setting forth the basic requirements for a settlement of the conflict and the principles on which it should be based , together with a coherent strategy to resolve the conflict .  
The General Assembly reaffirmed the responsibility of Governments to safeguard and protect the rights of migrants against illegal or violent acts , in particular acts of racial discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals or groups , and urged them to reinforce measures in that regard ; urged all States to adopt effective measures to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and detention of migrants , including by individuals or groups ; and called upon all States to protect the human rights of migrant children , in particular unaccompanied migrant children .  
Among the most significant aspects , the Government emphasized the importance given to the effective implementation of international accords on the matter , the fact that a lack of internal legislation should not hinder the protection of internationally recognized human rights , the provision of non-discrimination and equality of all persons , and the adoption of sanctions against the abuse and ill-treatment of certain vulnerable groups .  
The Special Rapporteur is pleased to report that , since the ongoing transitional process began , there have been apparent some substantial signals indicative of the Governments inclination to engage in a constructive dialogue on human rights .  
Reiterates its call to Member States to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and in this regard urges them to provide the necessary human , material and financial resources for timely and preventive measures including early warning , preventive diplomacy , preventive deployment , practical disarmament measures and peace-building as appropriate in each case ;

Takes note with satisfaction of the continuing efforts of developing countries , particularly those in African countries , to combat malaria through the formulation of plans and strategies at the national , regional and continental levels , despite their limited financial , technical and human resources ;  
The recommendations called upon Governments to sign and ratify relevant international instruments on migrant workers ; develop bilateral and multilateral agreements with a view to raising awareness and ensuring the protection of the human rights of women migrant workers ; and to provide training to immigration , police and consular officers on the proper handling of cases of violence against women migrant workers .  
Governments of countries of origin were called upon to develop comprehensive migration policies to facilitate safe and protected migratory movements of women and protect womens human rights ; to organize pre-departure courses for migrants and licensed recruitment agencies ; to monitor practices of recruitment agents ; and to develop mechanisms to assist women through diplomatic and consular posts in receiving countries .  
In terms of its real meaning , it bespoke a balance of terror , a cold-war calculation that the physical security and ultimate fate of hundreds of millions of human beings had to be held hostage to the prospect of instant annihilation .  
It had endorsed the two major international human rights covenants , was currently drafting a basic law on the guarantee of human rights and had shared with many countries the benefits of its outstanding achievements in economic development , agriculture , global trade and information and communications technology .  
It was a simple request for participation in the work of the United Nations by a State with impressive economic achievements and an exemplary human rights record , which had made laudable efforts in the field of national and economic assistance and technical cooperation .  
In its foreign policy , the Democratic Republic of the Congo understands that the use of force can not settle the problems confronting the world today and that in the struggle against terrorism there is a need to create a universal conscience and a universal union that can eliminate this scourge and others that threaten the very survival of the human race .  It is for this reason that my country has signed and ratified several global conventions dealing with the question of international terrorism .  
The manifestations of that daily horror are daily massacres of the civilian population , summary and extrajudicial executions , the deportation of entire populations , the taking of hostages , hijacking , the illegal capture and destruction of aircraft , the systematic rape and burying alive of women , destitution , other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , the deliberate and criminal spread of HIV / AIDS , and so forth .  
In the most unfortunate situations , the State apparatus , unable to cope with the security challenge posed by terrorism , is forced to take draconian measures to counter it , with an inevitable impact on civic and human rights .  
My country felt that it itself had been struck to its foundations , as did all States whose institutions rest on democratic principles , respect for the human person and the rule of law , values upon which our societies are based , as is the international community gathered at the United Nations . Its commitment to defending those values is therefore absolute .  
It is no exaggeration to say that the world situation is complex and difficult in view of the fact that our world today is rife with international conflicts that we have not been able to settle and chronic crises awaiting solutions that would break the spiral of violence and suffering threatening our human existence .  
It is an act that flagrantly violated a basic , fundamental right on which is based the functioning and entire legal , political , moral and religious structure of our societies and of human coexistence : respect for the right to life of every human being . 
In summary , let me state that we the peoples of the United Nations should be determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of terrorism ; to reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained ; and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom .

The key to attaining this objective lies in taking measures geared to halting and reversing the deterioration of physical infrastructure in landlocked and transit developing countries , continuing support for policy , legislative and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , including coordinated and collaborative human resource development , and enhancing international cooperation . 
For more than 50 years now , we have struggled to find ways to achieve that measure of global political coherence required to survive the grave risks posed by weapons of mass destruction , thermonuclear bombs foremost among them , whose blasts are thousands of times more powerful than those of 11 September arsenals that could lead to human extinction .  
The Inter-American Democratic Charter represents an important initiative , promoted by Peru , and reflects regional consensus on an unprecedented instrument which systematizes principles , norms and mechanisms for collective action , including diplomatic sanctions in cases of alteration or interruption of democratic institutionality , with a view to promoting , preserving and defending democracy from a human rights perspective .  
The mission , which had met with government representatives and a broad cross section of humanitarian partners and visited internally displaced persons locations in Bi , Huambo and Luanda provinces , expressed concern over allegations of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law , including forced relocation , targeting of civilians , forced conscription , looting of humanitarian supplies and sexual violence .  
The United States was committed to continuing and increasing support for sustainable economic growth and human development , accompanied by steady poverty reduction .  
In the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the Special Representative recognized that any assessment of the current human rights situation must take into account the degraded economic and social situation that was inherited by the democratically elected administration in October 2000 .  
In particular , he identified three areas of ongoing concern : the human rights situation and physical protection of ethnic minority communities in Kosovo ; the quality of the rule of law , including the independence of the judiciary ; and the extent to which human rights standards are reflected and integrated into the policies and practices of UNMIK and KFOR . 
He also recognizes that progress has been made in addressing a number of historical human rights violations committed by the former government prior to October 2000 , including the release of many political prisoners , investigations into the fate of persons of different ethnic groups missing during the armed conflict in Kosovo in 1999 and criminal investigations into murdered or other disappeared persons .  
He believes that a critical objective of the entire process of institutional reform must be an effective separation of legislative , executive and judicial powers with human rights and the rule of law as its foundation .  
My delegation believes that security is a subject that is not linked to international peace and security alone , but encompasses a series of elements within a multisectoral framework that , in addition to security , includes the commitment to promote democracy and full respect for human rights , to battle crime and illicit drugs , and to foster overall social and economic development in a harmonious way .  
In that Opinion , the Court stated that , given the unique characteristics of those weapons , in particular their destructive capacity , their capacity to cause untold human suffering , and their ability to cause damage to generations to come , the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be a potential catastrophe .  
Structural adjustment programmes have not had the expected outcome , and the Trade and Development Board , while welcoming the new emphasis of such programmes on poverty reduction , encourages continued attention to be paid to external factors as well as to shortcomings of domestic markets and enterprises , human capital and physical infrastructure , institutions and income distribution . 
The majority of those in academic circles who dealt with the issue of terrorism shared the opinion that terrorism meant the following : the use of or threat to use violence for political purposes ; a method of fighting or reaching specific goals based on intimidation of a society and government by causing human casualties and loss of property , characterized by ruthlessness and violation of moral and legal norms .  
The proposed operational and logistics base would be established at Kindu , which is located at the western fringe of an area characterized by many of the military , security , political and humanitarian and human rights problems that MONUC is likely to be confronted with in phase III .  
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .  
The use of coercive measures as a means of political and economic compulsion , whether unilaterally or under the auspices of regional and international organizations , poses a genuine threat to international peace and security and is in manifest violation of human rights principles .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Pope John Paul II , on 13 September , in accepting the credentials of the new Ambassador of the United States to the Holy See , said , In facing the challenges of the future , America is called to cherish and live out the deepest values of her national heritage : solidarity and cooperation between peoples ; respect for human rights ; the justice that is the indispensable condition for authentic freedom and lasting peace .  
Poverty , along with other situations of marginalization that engulf the lives of so many of the worlds people , including the denial of human dignity , the lack of respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms , social dislocation , intolerable refugee situations , internal and external displacement and physical and psychological oppression , are breeding grounds just waiting to be exploited by terrorists .  
Effective development strategies and economic and social sustainability depended on enhanced national capacity to operate within a comprehensive framework that reflected the interdependence of macroeconomic and financial issues with structural , social and human concerns , including environment and health . 
In the developing countries generally , limited infrastructure , inadequate regulatory systems , access costs and lack of human resources were serious handicaps to connectivity and the use of information and communication technologies , which were , moreover , not geared to their languages or their social and cultural contexts . 
The Centre will advocate , promote , monitor and assess the progress made by combining best practices and enabling policies , and compiling legislation and plans of action for the identification of illustrative cities for the two global campaigns and further advancing the normative debate and operational action on major human settlements issues .  
The problem of the illicit traffic in and the circulation of small arms and light weapons within the region of Southeastern Europe is of particular concern for the Republic of Macedonia , especially after the 1997 civilian unrest in Albania and the conflict in Kosovo ; it poses a serious threat not only to the security and stability of my country but to the broader region as well , particularly through its severe , adverse impact on economic , social and human development .  
His delegation called for the strengthening of regional and international mechanisms designed to contain conflicts and their destructive consequences , curb the factors that led to their outbreak and prosecute those responsible for acts involving human rights violations , terrorism , trafficking of drugs and prohibited weapons , organized crime and money-laundering , among others .  
On instructions from His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan , President of the United Arab Emirates , to make the individual in that State the pivot and the purpose of national development endeavours , the State had adopted legislation , policies and plans aimed at developing national human resources through the development and modernization of educational , health and cultural institutions and the establishment of centres to train young people and develop their scientific and technological skills in accordance with national development needs .  
The Task Force is responsible for : ( a ) recommending initiatives or actions which will lead to the establishment of a common service or the reinforcement of an existing one ; ( b ) reviewing proposals and recommendations put forward by the working groups on common services ; and ( c ) defining the degree of commitment of cooperation , participation and human and financial resources required from participating organizations .  
The involvement of the League is expected to provide the needed political support to advance the objective of the UNDP regional programme on governance with emphasis on strengthening parliaments , supporting frameworks for financial transparency and accountability , improving the administration of justice and promoting human rights .  
However , it does not meet the basic requirements , demanded of national human rights institutes , namely a founding constitutional or legislative text , independent appointment procedures and a pluralist and representative membership .  
Today aggression , intervention , interference in the internal affairs of other States , occupation of other countries territories by force , irredentism , racism and the threat or actual use of force , which had been considered relics of the past , manifest themselves along with rampant terrorism and other new forms of violence , deportations , ethnic cleansing , genocide and massive violations of human rights .  
Despite its own economic difficulties in the wake of the financial crisis in Asia , the Government had maintained its commitment to official development assistance ( ODA ) , which included cooperative programmes emphasizing local ownership and promoting human resources development in partnership with least developed countries . 
The Third Assessment Report ( published in 2001 ) , has projected that carbon dioxide concentrations and surface temperatures will increase globally , and asserted that the earths climate system had changed , globally and regionally , with most of the warming observed over the last 50 years attributable to human activities .  
The revised concept of operation of UNAMSIL is based on the forward deployment , in successive phases and in an integrated fashion , of the Missions military force of 17,500 personnel as well as United Nations civil affairs , civilian police and human rights personnel , representatives of humanitarian agencies and government personnel and assets to establish and consolidate State authority and basic services in areas controlled by RUF , including diamond producing regions , and in some border areas .  
In addition , pursuant to Security Council resolution 1308 ( 2000 ) of 17 July 2000 , and in the light of the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection among the population of Sierra Leone as well as among the Missions military and civilian personnel , it is proposed that a post for an HIV / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) policy officer be established at the P-4 level .  
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
At the same time , many delegates stressed that democracy was inconceivable without human rights and , in particular , the rights of women , children and minorities , and that it requires the gradual expansion of political space in order to guarantee the full exercise of the political , economic , social and cultural rights of all .  
In my view , the benchmark for a sustainable democracy is the extent to which a State acts in accordance with universal and indivisible human rights : the civil and political rights , as well as the economic , social and cultural rights defined in international human rights law .  
In addition to the loss of life and physical damage , international terrorism led to political instability , which was inimical to harmonious development of States , and made it necessary to devote huge human and financial resources to combating that scourge and eliminating its consequences .  
In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .  
Human rights must be respected and an adequate legal framework developed ; there was a need to apply sound macroeconomic policies , combat corruption and strengthen human and institutional capacities , both nationally and on the basis of international cooperation .  
Equally aware of the fact that older women , in all regions of the world , represent an important human resource , and that their contribution to society and development in the economic , cultural , political and social fields often remains unseen or unrecognized ,  
It was further observed that the fight against terrorism required a global effort based on international cooperation and international law , with due regard for human rights , and that it must go hand in hand with the search for lasting solutions to the human tragedies and political problems contributing to the instability which nurtured terrorist groups .  
Therefore , the delegations of Ecuador , Brazil , Chile , Canada and Guatemala reaffirm the importance for the strengthening and advancement of human rights and the combat of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , of developing , implementing and improving specific policies and programmes to address effectively a serious form of multiple discrimination , which occurs when racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance intersect with discrimination based on sexual orientation .  
They are pleased that they have the possibility to be treated as human beings and not mere changeable and disposable ciphers in a gigantic ideological game played by those who exercise power so that they can hold on to power and maintain a particular balance of power .  
I take heart from the new alliances I saw taking shape in Durban : the role that parliamentarians can play was highlighted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union ; the national human rights commissions sent us a powerful expression of their determination to play their part ; the treaty bodies and the special mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights played an active part ; the vital role of the media and the private sector in combating racism was emphasized .  
Energy is central to achieving the interrelated economic , social and environmental aims of sustainable human development , and energy services play a crucial role in providing efficient access to energy in support of development .

Calls upon all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral institutions to consider increasing allocations of human , technical and financial resources for South-South cooperation and , in this context , welcomes decision 2001 / 2 , of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Population Fund , in which the Board requested the Administrator to consider reviewing , in the context of the successor programming arrangements , the allocation of additional resources for activities involving technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Recognizing that the right of human beings to live free from fear and poverty can not be realized unless , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other international human rights instruments , conditions are created enabling all human beings to enjoy to the full their economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , the international community commits itself to treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds .  
Considering that there is a close relationship between the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and the realization of civil and political rights , since the various categories of rights constitute an indissoluble whole based on recognition of the dignity of the human person and therefore require permanent protection and promotion with a view to ensuring their full realization , so that there can never be any justification for violating one category of rights in order to realize others ,  
Considering that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent , and interrelated , and that the promotion and observance of economic , social and cultural rights are consubstantial with integrated development , equitable economic growth and the consolidation of democracy in the States of the region ,  
Reaffirming that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are mutually supportive concepts : democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural regime and their full participation in all aspects of life . 
The States of the region are asked to undertake to develop and implement national plans of action for human rights covering the entire range of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights , through a participatory process which includes civil society ;  
It is recommended that States give broad dissemination , especially among the members of the judiciary , to the international obligations that exist in the area of economic , social and cultural rights , and ensure that the necessary professional groups are trained , including those concerned with law enforcement and with human rights education at all levels of instruction ;  
International and regional organizations and the principal international and regional financial and development institutions are asked to evaluate the impact of their policies and programmes on the enjoyment of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights ;  
In January 2000 , the Security Council had recognized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic to which women and girls were especially vulnerable was a major threat to development and security , while the Commission on the Status of Women had emphasized that the full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights was of crucial importance in preventing the further spread of the disease .  
The Secretary-General , in his report prepared in June 2000 ( A / 54 / 918-S / 2000 / 581 ) , had noted that 20 years after the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and after billions of dollars had been expended to feed successive war efforts , Afghanistan remained in a state of acute crisis , with its resources depleted , its intelligentsia in exile , its people disenfranchised , its traditional political structures shattered and its human development indices among the lowest in the world .  
It is imperative that the Afghan people be central to the political plan , and that their human rights , long denied to them , and their legitimate expectation to live in freedom and with dignity in a society where peace is restored and the rule of law protects their lives and their livelihoods against violence and the depredations of powerful warlords , be realized .  
The utilization of the human resources services applications by the users during the reported period was comparable to the previous year ; the average number of personnel actions processed monthly at Headquarters was approximately 3,600 , compared with 3,500 reported in the twelfth progress report .

The Government also reported that a supreme decree of June 2001 established the Truth Commission , whose mandate is to help shed light on the crimes and human rights violations committed by terrorist organizations and State agents , to prepare proposals on moral and material reparations for victims and their families and to recommend legal and institutional reforms as preventive guarantees .

The unanimous anger aroused by the human and psychological damage done to the American people by the unexpected and shocking deaths of thousands of innocent people , whose images have shaken the world , is understandable .  
After the so-called end of the cold war , those who continued a military build-up and the development of the most sophisticated means of killing and exterminating human beings were aware that their huge military investments would give them the privilege of imposing their absolute and complete dominance over the other peoples of the world .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Among the recommendations of the Secretary-General was the strengthening of the mandate of BONUCA in order to enhance its effectiveness and the visibility of its activities by increasing its resource capabilities , strengthening its administrative capacities and making available to the Office a level of resources commensurate with its revised mandate , namely , bringing about political dialogue and national reconciliation , monitoring the security situation , ensuring respect for and the promotion of human rights ; and providing political support for the mobilization of resources with a view to the economic reconstruction of the country .

The international community ought therefore to help poor new democracies like Nepal to accelerate their sustainable economic development and social progress and thus help their quest to consolidate democratic polity , human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Encourages all States , the United Nations system and other actors to take advantage of the International Year of Freshwater to raise awareness of the strategic importance of achieving sustainable development and use of the freshwater resources of the world , which are essential for satisfying basic human needs , health and food production , economic and social development and the preservation of ecosystems , and to assign high priority to the formulation and implementation of action-oriented policies and programmes for the sustainable use of freshwater for social and economic purposes ;

Further recalling its resolutions 52 / 220 of 22 December 1997 , 53 / 242 of 28 July 1999 and 55 / 195 of 20 December 2000 , in which it requested the Secretary-General to consider further strengthening the Centre through the provision of requisite support and stable , adequate and predictable financial resources , including additional regular budget and human resources ,  
Sixty scientific academies of the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues ( IAP ) in May 2000,5 stressed that scientific , technological and health capabilities can produce substantial progress over the next two decades towards a sustainable human future and that this progress will demand a threefold effort by the scientific and technological community : to promote the use of existing knowledge more widely and effectively ; to generate new knowledge and beneficial technologies ; and to work with Governments , international organizations and the private sector to promote a worldwide transition to sustainability .  
More generally , science and technology are equally fundamental to pursuing solutions to human health and social issues , ranging from key human health questions such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) to sustainable transportation .  
Recalling further its resolutions 52 / 220 of 22 December 1997 , 53 / 242 of 28 July 1999 and 55 / 195 of 20 December 2000 in which it requested the Secretary-General to consider further strengthening the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) through the provision of the requisite support and stable , adequate and predictable financial resources , including additional regular budget and human resources ,

Recalling further its resolutions 52 / 220 of 22 December 1997 , 53 / 242 of 28 July 1999 and 55 / 195 of 20 December 2000 , in which it requested the Secretary-General to consider further strengthening the Centre through the provision of requisite support and stable , adequate and predictable financial resources , including additional regular budget and human resources ,  
Expressing its grave concern about the decades of conflict in Afghanistan , which has caused massive loss of life , extensive human suffering , destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
Welcoming the timely preparation of operational plans by the United Nations in response to the latest humanitarian crisis , and affirming the urgent need to reinforce international emergency assistance to Afghanistan in order to alleviate the human suffering and restore basic services ,  
To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
The fact that the human person is the central subject and primary beneficiary of human rights distinguishes human rights , including the right of authors to the moral and material interests in their works , from legal rights recognized in intellectual property systems .  
Whereas human rights are dedicated to assuring satisfactory standards of human welfare and well-being , intellectual property regimes , although they traditionally provide protection to individual authors and creators , are increasingly focused on protecting business and corporate interests and investments .  
Fourth , because the Commission can not possibly , for political and / or practical reasons , shed light on all countries in which there are severe and consistent patterns of human rights abuse , the Sub-Commission has used country-specific resolutions and statements by the Chairperson to help identify and put pressure on those countries which may not have received adequate attention in other human rights bodies .  
The Sub-Commission has particularly strengthened its expertise in the area of economic , social and cultural rights , and that expertise is manifesting itself in the development of the Social Forum and a number of thoughtful and timely studies and resolutions , including those on globalization , international trade and human rights , the effect of intellectual property on human rights , and the relationship between businesses and human rights .  
Thus , while providing information on the status of the UNCCD process , the reports should also contribute to the strengthening of the institutional and human capacities of national focal points and national coordinating bodies , thereby improving their ability to coordinate the work and to stimulate the further steps required for effective implementation of the UNCCD as an integral part of national efforts to promote sustainable development and global environmental protection .  
The review shall be open and transparent , inclusive , flexible and facilitative , as well as effective in terms of the use of financial , technological and human resources .  
To implement the strategy , a series of integrated , systemic and phased programme inputs in the political , social and economic spheres are envisaged and interlinked to reinforce each other and to help the Government to achieve three core objectives : accountable and transparent governance within the context of a broad-based participatory political framework ; political and social stability that rests on equity and respect of human rights ; and broad-based economic prosperity .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the past few years , in particular in armed conflicts and in post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of the countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
In contrast , the visible light from obtrusive advertising , defined as advertising in outer space that is capable of being recognised by a human being on the surface of the Earth without the aid of a telescope or other technological device , [ 2 ] is inescapable .  
This growth in international information-sharing is linked to a large extent to increasing global awareness of the need for continuous monitoring of the environment , natural resources and changes stemming from human activity , as well as emergency management , together with the free use of previously restricted technologies .  
On the contrary , international cooperation must be strengthened through increased development of institutional and human capacity , a more dynamic transfer of technology and know-how and adequate financing .  
The World Bank hoped that that report would contribute to the global debate at a time when it was imperative for individuals and communities to better manage their human , social , physical and natural resources in the long term and to rethink their basic assumptions about how to use the planets riches and plan economic development .  
Tunisia also attached great importance to the transparency of the Rio + 10 process , which , after assessing progress over the past 10 years , should develop specific action for the future and establish a detailed schedule for implementation of the Rio commitments , particularly those involving human and institutional capacity-building , the transfer of ecologically rational technologies and the provision of financial resources . 
While that great collective task which mobilized the entire international community would , of course , require human and material resources , it would also require strengthened international assistance for the implementation of environmental protection conventions and promotion of a new global partnership and a new social ethic that must be the goal and the aspiration of the Johannesburg Summit .

The High Commissioner , with regard to the accountability within the Indonesian judicial system for human rights offences perpetrated in East Timor , is of the view that the revised Decree 96 confers impunity for international crimes by limiting the temporal and geographical jurisdiction of the ad hoc court and that , accordingly , the United Nations , as a matter of principle , can not associate itself with proceedings thereunder .
