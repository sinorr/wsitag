It is obviously improper to allow the adoption of a punishment measure resulting in depriving people of personal freedom in such a simple and easy way.Because there is no strict and fair procedures for sending a person to labor reeducation , citizens may be unfairly treated .

The thinking of " three represents , " with its profound meaning expressed in simple and concise language , is a new summary of the party 's nature , aim and fundamental tasks .  It is a new development of the Marxist theory of party building and a new requirement placed by the new situation on party organizations and party cadres at all levels .  It is also the root of the party , the foundation of the administration and the source of strength .  
However , a small number of rural grass-roots cadres have a poor understanding of their mission to wholeheartedly serve the people .  The work style of these cadres is not down-to-earth , their work approach is simple and rude , they do not feel settled in working at the grassroots , and some of them even seek personal profits abusing their powers and encroach on the masses ' interests .  These problems urgently need to be solved .  
He stated that the science and technology hall is an important place for people to acquire scientific and technical knowledge , understand science and technology , and exchange S &amp; T knowledge and results , as well as being a base for primary and middle-school students to engage in quality education , so we should make full use of existing facilities , enhancing the content of the exhibits and also doing a good job of making the briefings and lectures lively and explaining difficult concepts in simple terms .  
If cadres are characterized by a uniform quality structure and simple experiences , with infantry officers not understanding the various branches of the military , cadres of the various branches of the military not understanding the issue of being composite , political cadres not understanding military matters , and military cadres not being able to do political work , such a state of affairs in terms of quality will not meet the requirements of joint operations in the context of informationization .  
The tasks undertaken by the Bureau of Investigation and Analysis which has more than 7,000 staff and more than 70 intelligence stations all over the world are the most mysterious .

Meanwhile , it also possesses certain rebellion-instigating , subversive , and anti-espionage functions .

The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .

Thus , the speech 's use of " Taiwan stands up " as a topic , the great and special discussion of " the beginning of a new age , " " overcoming fear , threats , and pressure , bravely standing up , " " symbolizing the pursuit of hope and the realization of dreams , " " seemingly standing before the threshold of an entirely new history , " and the final loud call for " Long live the Taiwan people , " perhaps all can not be explained from a simple literal meaning .  
These two held the high positions of party and national leaders , but were easy to get close to , were thrifty and simple .  They not only were strict on themselves , but were strict in their requirements for their daughter and other relatives , from beginning to end maintaining the basic character as servants of the public .  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
As regards the fourth nuclear plant , whose construction has begun , involving some NT36.4 billion of construction funds ( with more than 30 percent of the project completed ) to date , Taiwan 's new leader stated : The issue of scrapping or building the fourth nuclear plant is still at an appraisal stage .  It is by no means a simple question of right or wrong .  We have to take into account issues like how much we would lose if the " fourth nuclear plant " were not built ;  
However , the industrial and commercial circle of Taiwan could not therefore set their minds at rest .  In their thinking , it is absolutely not a simple thing that Ch'en Shih-meng , an official for the " quasi-cabinet " and a long-term advisor to Chen Shui-bian [ Chen Shuibian ] in financial and economic issues , posed the idea of collecting " national security tax " twice in one month , the period from May to early June . The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
The pictorial , in vivid visual form and simple language , provides graphic and rich materials for party members to fully understand and grasp the essence of the " three represents " theory .  It is a teaching aid for grass-roots party organizations to step up and improve party ideological and political work .  
Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
According to actual conditions and special features of administrative affairs , localities should define ways and set times to make their administrative affairs known to the public in a simple , convenient , and more effective manner .  
Social conditions are complex here , the grassroots organizations are weak , the rural propaganda , ideological , and cultural position has not been built effectively , the work style of certain grassroots cadres is rather simple and crude , cadre-masses relations are relatively tense , and rural development and stability have been affected to some extent .  
There are also , however , a number of rural problems that can not be neglected ; the main ones are that it is difficult for the peasants to increase income , and their burdens are too heavy , while the work style of certain grassroots cadres is simple and crude and they issue compulsory orders , causing bad incidents and mass incidents in certain localities .  
Some grassroots cadres have become seriously divorced from reality and the masses in their work ; they are not good at consulting the masses when doing things , are unable to handle rural contradictions in the new period , and display a simple and crude work style by issuing compulsory orders , arousing discontent among the masses .  
In the face of the new century , the new situation , and the new tasks , it is particular necessary to vigorously propagate and promote throughout the party the spirit of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of closely following the era and being bold in innovation , the spirit of advancing in the face of difficulties and pressing forward with indomitable will , the spirit of arduous struggle and pursuit of practical results , and the spirit of showing high ideals by simple living and of selfless dedication . 
What they are pursuing is no longer a simple " Cold-War mentality , " but an " imperial strategy " of seizing the sphere of influence , and their ideological basis is narrow ideology and ultra-nationalism .  And , with the two highly destructive " poisonous spiritual arrows " directly aimed at China , a marvelous strategic sight has taken shape , in which all the major forces with great interests in the region point their strategic focus at China .  
The opera displayed the importance and urgency of changing cadres ' work styles , making coherent the people 's feelings , and straightening out the party styles and social atmosphere in the new period .

Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .

Their coach , physical education professor Wu Teng-ta tells us : " The props for drum dancing are quite simple ; cymbals are all you need for backup accompaniment . Also the movements are lively and beautifully patterned , making this kind of dance perfect for high school and primary school students learning traditional folk dances . " The students of Taitung Normal College can take elective courses in drum dancing , so that some day they may pass along the art to their own students .  
With a simple and honest look of a farmer , matched with authentic Taiwanese and heavily accented Mandarin , he was extremely effective at using local flavor to add to the persuasiveness of the commercial . "  
Wang Chen-yi , secretary-general of the Association of Taiwanese Ballads , who has been to the mainland many times , contends that as ko-tzai-hsihas been developing for less than 100 years , it has the special characteristic of being thoroughly plain and simple . For example , singing is done in a natural voice , with the transitions gentle . Movements are smoother , more suave , closer to the style of southerners .  
Today it is seen as backward . You could say this is a product of a capitalist society . But the price will be paid for by future generations who will rely on the earth for survival , " says Chang Kuo-lung . He does not believe that a simple , conservationist lifestyle is necessarily uninteresting or dry ; on the contrary it is full of the fun of creativity .  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters . Production was simple , and performance techniques were based on traditional Chinese opera or the singing techniques of folk songs . To these were added clever , catchy songs by the basic team of Yao Min , who wrote the music , Chen Tieh-yi , who composed the lyrics , and Yao Li , who sang the vocals offstage .  
Probably the most common type of amulet is a lion 's head carved on a wooden panel , hung on the lintel over the front door . Its simple , mottled colors and stern features stand guard over the entrance day and night , keeping evil at bay .  
Later this developed into a fashion , the beads ' simple form became more complex , and they were officially defined as an accessory to court dress . Thus " court beads " were born , as an item of dress peculiar to the Ching court .  
Drinks prepared at bubble tea shops start with simple red or green tea . " It 's not very expensive , and you can drink a huge glass for half the price of a cup of coffee , and even spend several hours hanging out , " says a middle school student who often does just that with her classmates after the school bell rings .  
The method of their production may be quite different ; each is different in appearance . Take for example simple Chingmao tea , hung to dry in the sun . Or consider the many kinds of tea that are made from Chingmao leaves after they have been steamed soft and tightly compressed . There are many examples : bowl shaped Tuo tea ; square tea bricks ; tea cakes , which are beaten into a circular shape ; and many others .  
Eastern Taiwan 's inconvenient transportation is well-known , especially the railroad . Because the east is obstructed by the double barrier of the central mountain range and the coastal mountain range , beginning work on the railroad was extremely difficult . The earliest constructed stretch was a simple narrow gauge line from Hwalien to Taitung .  
" It 's a very technical issue , " explains jade expert Na Chi-liang . The objects of art from every era have their own special characteristics . The gods and animal face patterns of Liangzhu art is similar to the Taotie , a legendary beast often seen in statues of the Shang and Chou dynasties . But upon a more precise comparison , the beast faces of Liangzhu works appear more rustic and simple ; they purvey a feeling of fierceness .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
A heavy load of paper work , mostly administrative in nature , stirred in him strong feelings of nostalgia for the simple life he led as a straight weather forecaster . Hence , when a television station invited him to serve primarily as a weather forecaster , this tallied with his special interests , and after only a moment 's reflection he agreed .  
In his simple and idealistic visual presentations , Ku Shih-yung , who has won the Taipei Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art two times running , is neither making an argument nor a statement of protest , nor trying to describe anything at all . Rather he creates a dialectic between the real and imaginary to stimulate people 's memories and thus bring them into his philosophical utopia .  
One has the feeling of getting a complete picture of Taiwan , and the magazine 's simple style makes for absorbing reading . In the past , people did not well understand conditions on the other side of the Taiwan Strait , and with Chinese people 's penchant for extreme views , if it was not seen as poor and backward , corrupt and decadent and with declining moral values , then it was seen as a place where everything was better , an earthly paradise where the streets are paved with gold .  
The PRC is an enormous economic unit with the potential for explosive growth . Like a " black hole , " it could absorb and exhaust Taiwanese capital and technology . Further , the political standoff between the two sides has yet to be resolved . Commercial competition may have a complex impact on all this , and should not be seen as a simple economic problem .  
Chung Chin explains that she used data for 1991 because it made calculations relatively simple . In 1991 the PRC was strongly encouraging foreign firms to go all out to export goods and earn foreign exchange , and Taiwan firms were given little access to the domestic market . Therefore using total Taiwanese investment in the economic formula to calculate the contribution made to mainland Chinese exports would give a close approximation to the actual figure .  
The explanation is very simple : the ancients gathered their knowledge completely from nature ; they inferred a direct relation between the waxing and waning of the natural world and the birth and death of every human being . When would the fish swim up to the water 's surface through the broken ice ? When would the swallows arrive ? When would the crops bloom and wither ?  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu . They are guides to farming life , reference dates for weather forecasting and holidays for all sorts of ceremonial activities . Almanacs , the weather , agriculture , the general life of the community - - all abide under the shadow of the Solar Terms !  
The reception room has long been the part of the Presidential Palace that has received the greatest public exposure . Two years ago , the simple old carpet and armchairs from the frugal days of national reconstruction were replaced . Now the walls and furniture are all coordinated in a gentle cream color , and the carpet is decorated with Chinese motifs .  
Wen-hsiung has always been shy of strangers , but strange to say , as soon as he saw his father he would rush to hug him . Seeing an honest smile spread across his father 's simple , weathered face , Wen-hsiung feels very safe and happy .  
At the same time , because the environment was simple and more than a hundred students and teachers lived in the mountains day in and day out , the air was fresh and there were few distractions from the outside world . Naturally , they could devote all their hearts to their studies . And the emotional atmosphere went beyond the banal relation of teachers and students to become more like a family . The spirit of City High - - mutual cooperation and upright character - - naturally formed in daily interaction .  
The people complained that insurance premiums were too high . In the past an insurance policy allowed for free treatment ; now it has for no apparent reason taken a leap upward in cost due to the " partial cost sharing " regulation . And in the past you could go directly to a hospital to see a doctor with a good reputation for something as simple as a cold ; now with the medical referral system , you ca n't get through the front door .  
Then there is the canopy bed . It is ornate without being overly ostentatious . " This is evidence that although the mainstream in Ming furniture was to be simple and unpretentious , there are also pieces that are richly decorated and very elaborate , yet elegant and not gaudy . "  
Lin undertook a simple ritual gesture designed to break the spell ( he placed some water in a bowl and upended it on a small table under the traditional " double joy " character suspended on the wall ) , and everything was fine .  
Of course , reintroducing a species to the wild is very different from the artificial breeding performed in professional animal husbandry . In an artificial wild habitat , the deer must be gradually paired up and monitored . They must adapt to the wild setting and be tested by the powers of nature . The process takes a lot of time , and repopulation work is not so simple as artificial breeding .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
In his History of Chinese Food Science , writer Hong Guang-zhu notes that the Chinese have long believed that flavors can be divided into five basic simple types : salty , sour , bitter , pungent and sweet .  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
For the progress of their people , the educational workers of this mountainous area firmly man their posts , happy to lead simple , virtuous lives . Just like the orchid that attracts not the slightest attention , opening up little bright yellow blossoms under the cold wind and clamorous rain , they stand proud , refusing to bow their heads .  
However , simple watch display chips can not meet the needs of Taiwan 's information industry companies , and Taiwan spends enormous amounts of foreign exchange on dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) , static random access memory ( SRAM ) , central processing units ( CPUs ) and all kinds of other integrated circuits , which are assembled into computers and motherboards for export .  
Some legislators spoke on behalf of those involved , while others feared they would be branded as colluding with special interest groups . Nobody budged an inch . Thus a law that seemed simple on the surface was repeatedly delayed . Were it not for Mother Ko 's undaunted spirit and efforts , who knows when the compulsory insurance law would have seen the light of day .  
Anyone who has eaten kimche before might have an idea what to expect in Korean vegetarian cooking . The variety of vegetables is simple ; and steaming , boiling , and scalding are the most common cooking techniques . Oil is not often used , with sugar , soy sauce , sesame oil , hot peppers , and garlic-all ( save sugar ) powerful acrid flavorings-being preferred . Jung really enjoys this style , and feels that these are simple vegetarian recipes that people can use for a long time without getting tired of them .  
" At that time , we were only students , but living deep in the mountains , life was so hard for the Ssumakussu people . They brought out the best of all they had for us , and looking at their honest and simple faces , while we were very moved , we also felt ashamed and uneasy , " says Ma . " Who were they ?  
" For example , I discovered the Focolare Movement , founded fifty years ago by an Italian woman , Chiara Lubich . Besides spreading Catholic doctrine and beliefs , she also emphasized experimental lifestyles . She organized associations or cooperative societies in which people lived a simple life in close communion with nature . Today they still have communities and farms in West Africa and in Latin America . "  
Possibly the earliest story of rhododendron cultivation in China is set in the freewheeling days of the Zhen'guan reign ( 627-649 ) of the Tang dynasty . A penniless monk arrives at a monastery in southern China from faraway Mt . Tiantai in Zhejiang , asking for lodging . He is dressed in a simple robe , and carries with him a crock in which he has planted a red rhododendron , which he transplants at Helin Temple in Runzhou .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
" She 's a very special person , " says Li Huan-hsin , general manager of E . Excel 's Taiwan branch . He describes her as very intelligent , and very ambitious , even running all over to promote her ideas when she was pregnant ; but at the same time she is modest and affable , and her life is very simple .  
The average political commentators at the time seemed to be engaged in political discourse , admonishing the leaders of the country and serving as a mouthpiece for the people but , in actual fact , they were passing judgment based on some simple Confucian ideas of morality .  
The modern painter Mondrian constructed his artistic world from simple red , yellow , black and white squares ; and did n't Miro revel in a childlike , fairy-tale world ?  
Its logic is simple . Taiwan 's aborigines have coexisted with nature here for millennia , and , despite their hunting and farming , nature remained as robust as ever , and aboriginal peoples did not hunt animals to extinction . If we can learn their ecological wisdom , perhaps we can do better at resource management and conservation . Meanwhile , some aborigines will have the chance to choose their traditional way of life , thus helping to keep their culture and communities intact .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
In his thinking , the peasants have no month of rest and the life of the fields is one of exhausting hard labor . Yet he also saw the pleasure of rural life , when the peasants have finished work and " the children who were picking melons laugh and wash their feet at the water 's edge as the sun goes down , telling outrageous stories before the evening wind picks up . " This was a simple kind of leisure that the sophisticated literati were unable to appreciate .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
Chen Hao-yung of the NIPM says that once a virus develops into an urban virus it becomes very hard to eradicate . Viruses are very simple in structure , and as long as they have live cells to act as their hosts they can continue to reproduce . Hence cities , which have dense human populations and also harbor large numbers of rodents and other pests , are perfect breeding grounds for viruses .  
The gray roof tiles of the charming houses surrounded by mango trees make a quaint picture . The majority of residents in Chunghsing Village , the seat of the provincial government since its relocation in 1955 , consist of employees of the provincial government . The community benefits from excellent planning and facilities , and many civil servants here have enjoyed decades graced by the simple community lifestyle .  
" Today 's exam system produces people who only know how to pass exams . The ones who are no good at exams go into the dummies ' class , and those who fail are filled with a sense of inferiority ; by that time , it 's too late to save them . " Under soft yellow lamplight in a simple but elegant teahouse , a circle of listeners attentively watch the speaker in the middle .  
Thus evolved seafood dining in Taiwan , from simple roadside stands by the harbors to specialty shops to the " Warring States Period " pitting high-class restaurants against cheap chain shops against fresh fish street vendors . Meanwhile , because seafood raised in aquaculture ponds or imported from abroad has steadily replaced local seafood caught near the shores of Taiwan , the " most-favored fish " lists-especially for wedding banquet dishes-have seen some radical changes of fortune .  
Serving cheap but generous portions of good-quality , simple food with the authentic flavor of back home became the forte of dependents ' village eateries . Compared with the fashion in today 's catering industry for creating a trendy marketing image through commercial design and advertising , they seem to give especially good value for money , which is why so many experienced eaters-out are always on the lookout for them . But with the march of time , many of these little eateries are closing down or moving .  
As the fall of the Southern Tang loomed , Li remained unaware of just how near the enemy had drawn until the Song troops had Jinling totally encircled . In the end he walked out the city gates together with his ministers of state to proffer his final surrender wearing only a simple white gown , a stark symbol of surrender akin in Chinese culture to the act of running up a white flag .  
When Tiway Sayion retired from his position as principal of Hualien 's Tafalong Primary School after a teaching career that spanned 45 years , his first act was to realize a long-cherished dream-he returned to the tribal community where he was born and built a cabin in which to live . Tiway Sayion 's simple 20-ping cabin is laid out with the kitchen and bathroom on the right and the bedroom on the left . The center is his living room , furnished with only a sofa and bookshelves .  
In response to Lin 's accusations , Chiou I-jen , director of Chen 's national election campaign headquarters , said that Lin was engaged in slander pure and simple . In fact , explained Chiou , the entire matter was very easily explained . Chen Chin-tsai and Chen Tien-fu used Chen Shui-bian 's name without authorization to defraud Tan Kok Ping . This crime came to light long ago , and Chen Chin-tsai admitted under questioning that he had forged Chen Shui-bian 's signature .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
It all began eight years ago at a friend 's home , where Chen and his wife saw a statue of the Buddha dating back to the Northern Qi dynasty ( mid-6th century ) . Although neither of the two are Buddhists , they were captivated by the simple serenity of the statue . Concerned by the fact that war and chaos in China have left many of the country 's ancient Buddhist statues scattered across the globe , Chen decided to do his part to recover what he could from abroad .  
Today , multinational enterprises are no longer based on simple subsidiary or manufacturing relationships . Today they are highly planned and integrated transnational organizations . An important test for Taiwan firms as they internationalize in the future will be their ability to make plans for and integrate multinational resources .  
It does n't seem to require any great wisdom to have a bright and clean store with fast-food service , but when you link this simple product together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control , the result has swept the globe . Now over 20,000 franchises worldwide work to expand the company 's territory while the headquarters takes 0.5% of operating revenues as its share for as long as the franchise lasts .  
Hsia spent over 20 years in New York , painting in the cavernous gloom of his loft , eating Chinese food and listening to traditional Chinese opera music . The walls of the loft were pasted with simple verses , written by Hsia in language that was part literary Chinese and part colloquial .  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
It is one a.m . and the rhythms of techno music pulsate through a pub in the Hsinyi commercial district . Young people , filled with perhaps more than simple youthful energy , some wearing white gloves or waving fluorescent light sticks , bop around on a tiny dance floor bathed in black fluorescent light . Waving their hands in time with the music , they look like they are conducting some sort of intense pantomime .  
Composed of doctors and medical students from Yangming University , this group campaigns across Taiwan , north and south , against their declared enemy : chronic illnesses in remote or poor locations that lack the resources to cope . For the last two decades , this battalion of doctors has criss-crossed Taiwan 's 21 counties and cities , and even served in Kinmen . Having started out with a simple mission to conduct pap smears , they now target chronic illnesses and do preventive community medicine , leaving ineradicable traces of their passing .  
Wu Cheng-chun , general manager of the LungYen Group , explains that his company 's funeral service is organized around a simple system , in contrast to the convoluted requirements of a traditional funeral . All the essential rites are included , but not the various bizarre and superfluous additions that are often seen .  
The dehumidified room where the magnetic tapes full of solar images are stored contains a few simple glass-fronted cabinets ; between the stacks of computers in the computer room , there is barely space for one person ; and the work space behind it , separated off by cupboards , contains a long , makeshift table made by students , stacked with boxes full of various components , along with two dismantled astronomical telescopes .  
In the past there was also an enormous difference between the simple content of elementary school courses and the difficult and dry content of junior high school courses . In future , courses will be designed with continuity from first to ninth grade , and there will no longer be such a break between elementary and junior high school .  
Its design is based on the idea of an eastward-facing traditional Taiwanese sanheyuan farmhouse ( which has a square courtyard that is open on one side and enclosed on three by the main hall and its two wings ) . The school has a simple layout , with its classrooms connected by corridors . Doorways are constructed out of decorative cinderblocks and banisters out of stainless steel molded into plant motifs and matched with wooden railings . Outer walls are decorated with round , square , rectangular and cloud-shaped openings .  
Combining a mild outward appearance with a man-of-action personality lurking just beneath the surface , Robert Huang is actually rather similar to the seemingly stoic but untamably adventurous Victorian Englishmen that he admires . It probably is n't fair to attribute the success of Rose House , with its emphasis on Victorian style , to simple chance .  
In its traditional form , qigui has always been quite a simple matter . You go to any temple , stand facing any one of the small sacred tortoises set out on display , light three incense sticks to respectfully inform the netherworld of your choice , and then cast the divining blocks ( two matching wooden blocks shaped like the halves of a cashew nut ) .  
At the end of the 1980s , when speculative fever was running rampant and the stock market was reaching all-time highs , Li intuitively understood that the Taiwanese economy was in for big change , so he sold his plumbing and electrical business to his brother . On the introduction of a friend , he , at the ripe old age of 53 , moved into an entirely new field , making instruments and gauges . He started with relatively simple water and electricity meters .  
In two years of volunteer life , I made sure that I lived each day to the fullest , for this was a most precious life experience .

Leading it home is an old farming woman , who is carrying a bundle of sugar cane and wearing leggings and a broad rimmed hat with a covering scarf knotted under her chin . The simple and rustic scene does a good job of conveying Taiwan 's slow pace of life in those days .  
" A virtual studio is also called a blue-screen studio or green-screen studio , " says Andy Wang , vice president for 3D graphics and virtual reality at Imagetech , the first production company in Taiwan to introduce virtual studio technology . He explains that the spacious virtual studio only has simple props , but the blue background is removed from the image by computer and replaced in real time with scenes prepared in advance using Maya or Max software , so that the combined image can be directly broadcast .  
To date there is no scientific evidence that reflexology can cure disease . But for more than 20 years this simple and easily learned method of massage , by which practitioners seek to enhance the self-healing powers of bodily organs by stimulating nerve endings in the body 's extremities , has played an irreplaceable role among the methods of maintaining health practiced by ordinary people in Taiwan .  
The reason is simple : " Because plants do not grow for us to eat them . " The cell structure of most biological materials is very durable , and not easily broken down . Therefore it is difficult for the matter inside to be released , much less absorbed into the human body .  
In his faculty apartment at Tainan National College of Arts , there hangs a picture he took of a little girl in a military dependent 's village . The girl is wearing a simple white dress and her eyes are staring at the camera . It is Chang 's favorite photo .

Getting the injured quickly to medical treatment was the only bright spot in an otherwise tragic day . The accident was caused by simple human error , but some point out that the railway is underfunded and disaster could have struck in other ways . Each year there are 800,000 visitors to the Alishan Forest Recreation Area , which is under the auspices of the Taiwan Forestry Bureau , and every holiday the area is packed with visitors .  
Because , in the eyes of an ordinary person , their abilities border on pure magic . A painter uses a brush , a bit of ink , and a few colors to create a world beyond anything we could imagine . A poet takes the words we all learned in elementary school and writes them into verses that people recite for centuries . Musicians compose simple sounds into musical pieces that are played for generations .  
Luo Ta-you penned the song 's music , including its simple , fluid melody . The lyrics , meanwhile , represented the collective effort of a group that included Luo , Lee Shou-chuan , Chang Ta-chun , Sylvia Chang , Chiu Fu-sheng , and Jan Hung-tze .

Although Peter Lai 's methods for gaining his mastery of the English language may appear diverse and unusual , they are based on a simple and unchanging principle .

It is there on radio and television and in magazines , but a student needs the conviction , courage and patience to work hard and take full advantage of these resources in order to succeed .  
Although the oysters on the white porcelain dish were small , they gave off a rich aroma that the fat chunky oysters in Taiwan just do n't have . There was no starch , no sweet and hot sauce , no cabbage , just a simple platter of oysters and eggs , but still it tasted great . It was only then that I realized why the early immigrants to Taiwan were so deeply attached to ou-a-jian .  
The asphalt itself creates many lines on its own , and these give the paintings a simple and unpretentious quality . No wonder Chiu has become so thoroughly enamored of asphalt . Interestingly , while we are used to seeing asphalt that is black due to its thickness , it turns into various shades of brown when diluted with solvent . Sometimes , Chiu adds pigment to give the asphalt " color . "  
Chiu held onto a spirit of " releasing the spirit tied up by the cities and returning to the peaceful , simple life of the country . " Putting features of Taiwanese scenery-whether from Lanyu , Penghu , or Chiufen-into his paintings , he came at his topics from a critical angle . Rather than making comparisons about beauty or ugliness , he relied on inner feeling-taking his melancholy and concerns about the transformation of the local landscape and revealing them for everyone to see on his canvases .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste .

Taiwan has a long history of live performance , from simple shows held in crude tents , to fancy choreographed acts with crystal stages and catwalks , and everything in between . Audiences have changed their preferences in step with the changing times . Different audiences have had unique preferences and enjoyed special interactions with certain stars .  
He explains that in 1949 when the ROC government decamped for Taiwan , amid the economic turmoil people had little income , and one of the few ways they sought entertainment was to go to Yingchiao neighborhood by the Tanshui River and listen to singing at the open-air teahouses . " The venues did n't have pleasant lighting , just simple tables and chairs , but sitting there with an evening breeze at twilight , listening to the gentle singing on stage-it offered something audiences could n't find elsewhere . "  
Kray Kee is a small settlement of the Karen minority , located in the northwestern Thai county of Tha Song Yang , nine kilometers from the nearest main road . It used to take three hours to reach on foot , until only a year ago villagers working together finally built a simple road through the mountains , allowing access to four-wheel-drive vehicles . However , during the monsoon season , this unstable mud road becomes much more dangerous to travel along and the only reliable way to reach the village is on foot .  
Gourds would become a way of life , a creative lynchpin , and the foundation for making the village self-sufficient .

Through Kung 's works , more and more people are coming to appreciate the beauty inherent in even something as simple as a gourd .  
The simple absolute ( additive ) model assumes a constant ( dose-related ) excess of induced cancer throughout life , unrelated to the age-dependent spontaneous rate of cancer .  
The simple relative ( multiplicative ) model , assumes that the rate of induced cancers will increase with age as a constant multiple ( dose-related ) of the spontaneous cancer rate .

It is also the root of the party , the foundation of the administration and the source of strength .  
However , a small number of rural grass-roots cadres have a poor understanding of their mission to wholeheartedly serve the people .

These problems urgently need to be solved .

The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .

But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .

Thus , the speech 's use of " Taiwan stands up " as a topic , the great and special discussion of " the beginning of a new age , " " overcoming fear , threats , and pressure , bravely standing up , " " symbolizing the pursuit of hope and the realization of dreams , " " seemingly standing before the threshold of an entirely new history , " and the final loud call for " Long live the Taiwan people , " perhaps all can not be explained from a simple literal meaning .  
These two held the high positions of party and national leaders , but were easy to get close to , were thrifty and simple .  They not only were strict on themselves , but were strict in their requirements for their daughter and other relatives , from beginning to end maintaining the basic character as servants of the public .  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
As regards the fourth nuclear plant , whose construction has begun , involving some NT36.4 billion of construction funds ( with more than 30 percent of the project completed ) to date , Taiwan 's new leader stated : The issue of scrapping or building the fourth nuclear plant is still at an appraisal stage .  It is by no means a simple question of right or wrong .  We have to take into account issues like how much we would lose if the " fourth nuclear plant " were not built ;  
However , the industrial and commercial circle of Taiwan could not therefore set their minds at rest .  In their thinking , it is absolutely not a simple thing that Ch'en Shih-meng , an official for the " quasi-cabinet " and a long-term advisor to Chen Shui-bian [ Chen Shuibian ] in financial and economic issues , posed the idea of collecting " national security tax " twice in one month , the period from May to early June . The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
The pictorial , in vivid visual form and simple language , provides graphic and rich materials for party members to fully understand and grasp the essence of the " three represents " theory .  It is a teaching aid for grass-roots party organizations to step up and improve party ideological and political work .  
Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
According to actual conditions and special features of administrative affairs , localities should define ways and set times to make their administrative affairs known to the public in a simple , convenient , and more effective manner .  
Social conditions are complex here , the grassroots organizations are weak , the rural propaganda , ideological , and cultural position has not been built effectively , the work style of certain grassroots cadres is rather simple and crude , cadre-masses relations are relatively tense , and rural development and stability have been affected to some extent .  
There are also , however , a number of rural problems that can not be neglected ; the main ones are that it is difficult for the peasants to increase income , and their burdens are too heavy , while the work style of certain grassroots cadres is simple and crude and they issue compulsory orders , causing bad incidents and mass incidents in certain localities .  
Some grassroots cadres have become seriously divorced from reality and the masses in their work ; they are not good at consulting the masses when doing things , are unable to handle rural contradictions in the new period , and display a simple and crude work style by issuing compulsory orders , arousing discontent among the masses .  
In the face of the new century , the new situation , and the new tasks , it is particular necessary to vigorously propagate and promote throughout the party the spirit of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of closely following the era and being bold in innovation , the spirit of advancing in the face of difficulties and pressing forward with indomitable will , the spirit of arduous struggle and pursuit of practical results , and the spirit of showing high ideals by simple living and of selfless dedication . 
What they are pursuing is no longer a simple " Cold-War mentality , " but an " imperial strategy " of seizing the sphere of influence , and their ideological basis is narrow ideology and ultra-nationalism .  And , with the two highly destructive " poisonous spiritual arrows " directly aimed at China , a marvelous strategic sight has taken shape , in which all the major forces with great interests in the region point their strategic focus at China .  
The opera displayed the importance and urgency of changing cadres ' work styles , making coherent the people 's feelings , and straightening out the party styles and social atmosphere in the new period .

It had strong artistic influence and educational effect , and was a very strongly practical drama for implementing education in party styles and honest administration in grass-roots rural areas .  
Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .

The sky ca n't be reached in a single bound though , as the Chinese expression goes .

Taiwanese folk opera is sung in the vernacular and is easy for the local community to understand . Its affecting stories of lovelorn suffering proved immensely appealing to farmers and fishermen whose simple lives otherwise offered little opportunity for leisure or recreational pastimes .  
Chang Hao has a penetrating analysis in that regard . Modernization theories , he points out , have their origin in the 18th-century Enlightenment . Their argument is simple : " modernization " - - meaning industrialization , capitalism , the rise of a middle class , democracy and freedom of thought - - is good and the sole criterion of value used to measure a country 's " progress . " And evidenced by the " backward " countries of the " non-Western world , " modernization and tradition are often antithetical .

Radio drama and other popular programs went into decline once TV began to air similar shows . From its peak in 1961 , radio listenership fell to an all-time low after the Chinese Television System hit the screens in 1971 .

Today it is seen as backward . You could say this is a product of a capitalist society . But the price will be paid for by future generations who will rely on the earth for survival , " says Chang Kuo-lung . He does not believe that a simple , conservationist lifestyle is necessarily uninteresting or dry ; on the contrary it is full of the fun of creativity .  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters .

The method of their production may be quite different ; each is different in appearance . Take for example simple Chingmao tea , hung to dry in the sun . Or consider the many kinds of tea that are made from Chingmao leaves after they have been steamed soft and tightly compressed . There are many examples : bowl shaped Tuo tea ; square tea bricks ; tea cakes , which are beaten into a circular shape ; and many others .  
Eastern Taiwan 's inconvenient transportation is well-known , especially the railroad . Because the east is obstructed by the double barrier of the central mountain range and the coastal mountain range , beginning work on the railroad was extremely difficult .

" It 's a very technical issue , " explains jade expert Na Chi-liang . The objects of art from every era have their own special characteristics . The gods and animal face patterns of Liangzhu art is similar to the Taotie , a legendary beast often seen in statues of the Shang and Chou dynasties . But upon a more precise comparison , the beast faces of Liangzhu works appear more rustic and simple ; they purvey a feeling of fierceness .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
A heavy load of paper work , mostly administrative in nature , stirred in him strong feelings of nostalgia for the simple life he led as a straight weather forecaster .

One has the feeling of getting a complete picture of Taiwan , and the magazine 's simple style makes for absorbing reading . In the past , people did not well understand conditions on the other side of the Taiwan Strait , and with Chinese people 's penchant for extreme views , if it was not seen as poor and backward , corrupt and decadent and with declining moral values , then it was seen as a place where everything was better , an earthly paradise where the streets are paved with gold .  
The PRC is an enormous economic unit with the potential for explosive growth . Like a " black hole , " it could absorb and exhaust Taiwanese capital and technology . Further , the political standoff between the two sides has yet to be resolved . Commercial competition may have a complex impact on all this , and should not be seen as a simple economic problem .  
Chung Chin explains that she used data for 1991 because it made calculations relatively simple . In 1991 the PRC was strongly encouraging foreign firms to go all out to export goods and earn foreign exchange , and Taiwan firms were given little access to the domestic market . Therefore using total Taiwanese investment in the economic formula to calculate the contribution made to mainland Chinese exports would give a close approximation to the actual figure .  
The explanation is very simple : the ancients gathered their knowledge completely from nature ; they inferred a direct relation between the waxing and waning of the natural world and the birth and death of every human being . When would the fish swim up to the water 's surface through the broken ice ? When would the swallows arrive ? When would the crops bloom and wither ?  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu .

Wen-hsiung has always been shy of strangers , but strange to say , as soon as he saw his father he would rush to hug him . Seeing an honest smile spread across his father 's simple , weathered face , Wen-hsiung feels very safe and happy .  
At the same time , because the environment was simple and more than a hundred students and teachers lived in the mountains day in and day out , the air was fresh and there were few distractions from the outside world . Naturally , they could devote all their hearts to their studies . And the emotional atmosphere went beyond the banal relation of teachers and students to become more like a family . The spirit of City High - - mutual cooperation and upright character - - naturally formed in daily interaction .  
The people complained that insurance premiums were too high . In the past an insurance policy allowed for free treatment ; now it has for no apparent reason taken a leap upward in cost due to the " partial cost sharing " regulation . And in the past you could go directly to a hospital to see a doctor with a good reputation for something as simple as a cold ; now with the medical referral system , you ca n't get through the front door .  
Then there is the canopy bed . It is ornate without being overly ostentatious . " This is evidence that although the mainstream in Ming furniture was to be simple and unpretentious , there are also pieces that are richly decorated and very elaborate , yet elegant and not gaudy . "

Of course , reintroducing a species to the wild is very different from the artificial breeding performed in professional animal husbandry . In an artificial wild habitat , the deer must be gradually paired up and monitored . They must adapt to the wild setting and be tested by the powers of nature . The process takes a lot of time , and repopulation work is not so simple as artificial breeding .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
In his History of Chinese Food Science , writer Hong Guang-zhu notes that the Chinese have long believed that flavors can be divided into five basic simple types : salty , sour , bitter , pungent and sweet .  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
For the progress of their people , the educational workers of this mountainous area firmly man their posts , happy to lead simple , virtuous lives . Just like the orchid that attracts not the slightest attention , opening up little bright yellow blossoms under the cold wind and clamorous rain , they stand proud , refusing to bow their heads .  
However , simple watch display chips can not meet the needs of Taiwan 's information industry companies , and Taiwan spends enormous amounts of foreign exchange on dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) , static random access memory ( SRAM ) , central processing units ( CPUs ) and all kinds of other integrated circuits , which are assembled into computers and motherboards for export .  
Some legislators spoke on behalf of those involved , while others feared they would be branded as colluding with special interest groups . Nobody budged an inch . Thus a law that seemed simple on the surface was repeatedly delayed . Were it not for Mother Ko 's undaunted spirit and efforts , who knows when the compulsory insurance law would have seen the light of day .  
Anyone who has eaten kimche before might have an idea what to expect in Korean vegetarian cooking . The variety of vegetables is simple ; and steaming , boiling , and scalding are the most common cooking techniques . Oil is not often used , with sugar , soy sauce , sesame oil , hot peppers , and garlic-all ( save sugar ) powerful acrid flavorings-being preferred . Jung really enjoys this style , and feels that these are simple vegetarian recipes that people can use for a long time without getting tired of them .  
" At that time , we were only students , but living deep in the mountains , life was so hard for the Ssumakussu people . They brought out the best of all they had for us , and looking at their honest and simple faces , while we were very moved , we also felt ashamed and uneasy , " says Ma . " Who were they ?  
" For example , I discovered the Focolare Movement , founded fifty years ago by an Italian woman , Chiara Lubich . Besides spreading Catholic doctrine and beliefs , she also emphasized experimental lifestyles . She organized associations or cooperative societies in which people lived a simple life in close communion with nature . Today they still have communities and farms in West Africa and in Latin America . "  
Possibly the earliest story of rhododendron cultivation in China is set in the freewheeling days of the Zhen'guan reign ( 627-649 ) of the Tang dynasty . A penniless monk arrives at a monastery in southern China from faraway Mt . Tiantai in Zhejiang , asking for lodging . He is dressed in a simple robe , and carries with him a crock in which he has planted a red rhododendron , which he transplants at Helin Temple in Runzhou .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
" She 's a very special person , " says Li Huan-hsin , general manager of E . Excel 's Taiwan branch . He describes her as very intelligent , and very ambitious , even running all over to promote her ideas when she was pregnant ; but at the same time she is modest and affable , and her life is very simple .  
The average political commentators at the time seemed to be engaged in political discourse , admonishing the leaders of the country and serving as a mouthpiece for the people but , in actual fact , they were passing judgment based on some simple Confucian ideas of morality .  
The modern painter Mondrian constructed his artistic world from simple red , yellow , black and white squares ; and did n't Miro revel in a childlike , fairy-tale world ?  
Its logic is simple . Taiwan 's aborigines have coexisted with nature here for millennia , and , despite their hunting and farming , nature remained as robust as ever , and aboriginal peoples did not hunt animals to extinction . If we can learn their ecological wisdom , perhaps we can do better at resource management and conservation . Meanwhile , some aborigines will have the chance to choose their traditional way of life , thus helping to keep their culture and communities intact .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
In his thinking , the peasants have no month of rest and the life of the fields is one of exhausting hard labor . Yet he also saw the pleasure of rural life , when the peasants have finished work and " the children who were picking melons laugh and wash their feet at the water 's edge as the sun goes down , telling outrageous stories before the evening wind picks up . " This was a simple kind of leisure that the sophisticated literati were unable to appreciate .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
Chen Hao-yung of the NIPM says that once a virus develops into an urban virus it becomes very hard to eradicate . Viruses are very simple in structure , and as long as they have live cells to act as their hosts they can continue to reproduce . Hence cities , which have dense human populations and also harbor large numbers of rodents and other pests , are perfect breeding grounds for viruses .

The center is his living room , furnished with only a sofa and bookshelves .
