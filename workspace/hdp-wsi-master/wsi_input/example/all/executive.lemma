" Falungong " is a cult .  This is not determined by the " will of the chief executive " , nor is it the central government 's subjective " decision " .  It is an iron-clad fact based on innumerable instances , and the conclusion is based on foreign governments ' legislation experiences .  
Recently , at an interview by a Hong Kong reporters ' delegation , Raidi , executive deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the autonomous regional people 's congress said : After the passing of the 14th Dalai Lama , we will find the reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals that were formed hundreds of years ago .

"  
Therefore , one of important tasks for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland was to find out a chief executive who truly loves the country and Hong Kong and who can shoulder the heavy duties at a historic turning point .  The election of Tung Chee-hwa was widely acclaimed by people at home and abroad as well as by people of the central government and the international community .  Hong Kong residents also are happy to have such a person as their chief executive .  
Under the main orientation of orderly and gradual development of Hong Kong 's democratic political system , the Basic Law lays down the method for producing the chief executive and legislative organs of the SAR , and there are clear regulations on the emergence and appointment of the chief executive and the leading officials .  
Some people have pointed out that the new leader in Taiwan has been making a show everywhere , " talking big repeatedly " and lacking positive " policies , " that " officials all express their own different views and make frequent changes in policies , " and that the " executive yuan " and the " legislative yuan " are constantly engaged in verbal arguments .  
It is a complicated and long-term task to correctly appraise the social situation and the will of the people .  The SAR Government and all people loving the country and Hong Kong must build firm confidence .  The principle of " one country , two systems " has enjoyed abundant popular support and stands a very good chance of success .  The chief executive and the SAR Government have done substantial and effective work .  Local economic discovery is under way .  Our society is now stable and united .

Shi Guangsheng , minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation and vice chairman of the preparatory committee , Chen Liangyu , executive vice mayor of Shanghai , and other leading comrades from relevant central and State Council departments and the municipal government of Shanghai attended the meeting .  
Question : Since the new US president is expected to emerge amidst " wrangling " and the two political parties are also likely to have equal shares in both the Senate and the House of Representatives in the future , will such a situation make it difficult for the executive departments to introduce drastic changes to the existing policies ?  
She Mengiao , secretary of the party group and executive vice chairman of the China Law Society , called at the meeting on jurists and lawyers around the country to gain a complete understanding of the evil nature of " Falungong " and make full use of the legal weapons in their hands to crack down on criminal activities carried out by the " Falungong " cult organization and educate and redeem stubborn " Falungong " members so as to remove the social cancer , making their due contributions .

He emphasized the importance of " administering Macao according to law " in ensuring Macao 's stability and prosperity and hoped the Legislative Council will continue to closely coordinate in its work with the executive and judicial departments of the special administrative region in future to jointly build Macao 's beautiful tomorrow .  
It has been proven by facts in the entire process , chief executive Tung Chee-hwa , the SAR government , central institutions stationed in Hong Kong , and people from all circles have never doubted and criticized the nature and activities of other religions .  On the contrary , they have recommended upright religious activities as positive forces for stabilizing the society and guiding people toward benevolence .  
The session maintains that , in the new year , the Supreme People 's Court should , in light of the requirements set for managing the country by the law and building a socialist country ruled by the law , comprehensively strengthen all its adjudicative and executive efforts , censure all forms of crime by the law , and intensify its efforts in examining civil , commercial and administrative cases with the purpose to resolve various social problems .  
" As part of the territory of China , we have been authorised to exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication , in accordance with our principal constitutional document , the Basic Law . "  
Under the principle of " One Country , Two Systems " , the socialist system and policies are not practiced in Hong Kong , and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged .  The HKSAR enjoys executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication .  
Their governing bodies and executive management are responsible for maintaining the financial well-being of their respective entities , including keeping the capital costs of projects under construction under tight control , lowering the operating costs of completed projects where justified , and revising the annual business plans as necessary in order to achieve the target rate of return over a period of time .  
In accordance with the Basic Law , we have established the HKSAR Government and realised the principles of " One Country , Two Systems " , " Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong " and " a high degree of autonomy " .  Our lifestyle and social system remain unchanged .  The well established executive , legislative and judicial systems continue to function effectively .  Hong Kong society continues with its smooth and steady development .  
The Basic Law is the constitutional law of the HKSAR . It stipulates the systems and policies of the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems , the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems , and the relevant policies .

During its stay in the United Kingdom , France and Germany , the delegation will meet with Ministers , senior civil servants , academics and experts in constitutional law , think-tank bodies as well as non-government organizations concerned .

Dr Wong said that for each of the above key areas , the EC have identified all the involved executive and advisory bodies and the area of responsibilities for each of them so as to delineate the division of responsibilities more clearly , adding that the party which oversees each area would set out a critical path for the implementation work within its respective sphere . 
Taking into account comments of the Bills Committee and the Hong Kong Association of Banks , as the amended definition of " manager " may be inconsistent with the existing penalty provision , we propose to clarify the provision to the effect that any reference in this Ordinance to the commission of an offence for which every director , chief executive or manager of an authorized institution shall be held liable means that one or more than one of any such person may be prosecuted .  
The consultant , after taking into account the qualitative adjustment factors attributable to the senior positions in the bodies under review , has come up with a net downward adjustment of 10 per cent for prestige identified with two chief executive positions .  
A recently held ' experience sharing ' session , which provided an opportunity for senior Police officers to interact with a chief executive from the local private sector , has been described as a ' raging ' success .  The session was held at the Senior Officers ' Mess in late July .  
( b ) The HKMA must not disclose information of individuals or individual authorized institutions obtained by it in the discharge of its supervisory functions .  However as I said earlier , the HKMA may , in certain cases , complete the vetting and approval process of senior management changes in banks within a few days .  The time required in the case of BOC Hong Kong 's chief executive post was about the same as that required in similar cases .  
After graduation from college , he engaged in journalistic , cultural and educational work . Later , he served as an executive member of the party 's Taiwan provincial office based at Chang chow , Fukien province , and was elected a member of the party 's Sixth National Congress .  
Wu Kuang-ting , for many years secretary of overseas Chinese affairs at the ROC embassy , explains : " There are three such chief justices in Panama , each nominated by the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government respectively . Because they are responsible for overseeing the elections they must enjoy impeccable reputations . That Luis Chen was the nomination of the executive branch shows how highly he was regarded by the former government . "  
From being elected to the Legislative Yuan with the highest number of votes in the country , to his " change in careers " to become an executive branch official , Environmental Protection Administration Director Jaw Shau-kong has used his broad public support as his shield in undertaking the work of protecting the environment . Although he has run up against counterattacks from polluting industries and is seen as wreaking havoc in the " political ecology , " he has for this very reason accumulated even greater political resources : constituent support .  
However , the ownership of the publishing rights overseas is rather complex . Sometimes the rights belong to the writer , sometimes to the publishing house , and sometimes to an agent . " If you 're not familiar with the terrain , for publishers without any experience negotiating international publishing rights , it is very easy to look in the wrong places for partners , " says Luc Kwanten , executive vice president of the Big Apple Tuttle-Mori Agency , which has been operating for five years .  
In our original conception , there would be nine items for evaluation - - those being , besides the eight main powers of legislators , also adding one item for " constituent service . " There are four criteria for evaluation - - whether the legislator effectively promotes a balance with the executive ; whether the legislator 's attitude in interpellations is reasonable ; the extent to which expressed political views are realized in practice ; and whether or not the legislator follows the constitution . ( However , we do n't include ideology . )  
Local enterprises are still not very enthused about international strategic alliances , and they do n't understand them very well , " says Huang Hsiao - kuan , executive director of the business alliance group . Most American strategic alliances are games between large corporations , and transnational matchups require that " both families are of comparable standing . " Not only do both sides have to have suitable manpower , technology , and capital to be mutually attractive , they need comparable international perspectives and internationalization experience before they can really communicate .  
Wu is the executive director of the foundation and its painful opening announcement was like a short summary of his work : " The Chinese Communists established the reform-through-labor brigades some 40 years ago . Their inmates still include so-called counter-revolutionaries , class enemies , those deemed to be against the party and socialism , religious figures , " historical " counter-revolutionaries and members of the Tienanmen democracy movement .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .  
Not long ago , Taipei County executive You Ching wanted to hire Lin Yu-yi , a professor from National Normal University ( the elite teaching university ) , as director of the county Bureau of Education . The provincial government rejected him on the grounds that his qualifications were not suitable , and assigned someone else . This led to a conflict over which appointee should take office , and for a time relations between the two sides were strained .  
This is still far removed from Chen Tingnan 's ideal for a " county cabinet , " in which all top administrators come and go with the executive , need not be approved by the provincial government , and are not bound by the civil service regulations on qualifications but are seen as political appointees . But at least it 's some improvement .  
Wang Hsing-ching observes that most people are far less ready to accept an aboriginal at the head of an administration than as a councillor , provincial assembly member or other elected representative , " for such representatives only represent their minority community , but the local chief executive represents a whole county or city , including the Han Chinese as well as the ' native people . ' '  
After being returned to China , Taiwan was kept apart and given a special status because the mainland had not returned to a state of normalcy . Administration was placed in the hands of a single " hsing-cheng chang-kuan " appointed by the central government . This term is generally rendered into English as " governor , " but its literal translation is " chief executive official . " Meanwhile , other aspects of life in Taiwan - - such as the currency , rationing , and so on - - were also different from the mainland .  
Kwong Chi-hung , general manager of the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company , believes that only technical adjustments will be needed in textbooks to cope with political changes . Phrases that smack of colonialism can be altered . For example , the Chinese title of the highest ranking official can be changed from zongdu ( a term corresponding to the English title " governor , " but which in Chinese carries the feeling of " viceroy " or " imperial official " ) to " chief executive . "  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
The nation 's second highest official furtively flying off to foreign soil to engage in " secret diplomacy " brought varying reactions : Some members of the media described his departure as a virtually supernatural " disappearance , " and the opposition questioned if such a mission was n't better suited to a secret ambassador than a high-ranking executive official , at least until there was a major foreign-relations breakthrough with Ukraine .  
The central level reform issues came up first . Even before the conference began , the KMT 's dual executive mixed system idea was being attacked on all sides . Skeptics argued that the proposal was aimed at expanding presidential power and establishing a firm foundation for the vice-president serving concurrently as premier . Some boldly declared that the proposal was simply intended to pave the way for Lee Teng-hui to run for re-election .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down . The main reason was the powerful obstruction of the " male outlook . "  
Her main hope now is revise the laws to meet the demands of the times , so that executive agencies can be more efficient . Film is another industry " guided " by the GIO . Though not as complex as the broadcast industry , it has its headaches as well , especially the poor economic returns on domestic films .  
In looking toward all of the preparations for the handover , those relating to government-including the establishment of the Basic Law and the holding of elections , the building of the airport , and even the appointment of the special administrative region 's chief executive and the arrival of the People 's Liberation Army-all have been accomplished . People 's private responses to the turnover-including the rush to get second passports , the return flow of emigrants , the real-estate boom-these too have already happened . Will there be big changes in the future ?  
In the days leading up to the takeover , one periodically reads of incoming chief executive Tung Chee-hwa admonishing Hong Kong people : Confucian culture must be strengthened , civic education is very valuable , family values must be reconstructed .  
" Those of us engaged in social work appreciate that there is a difference between the ideal and the reality of the situation , " says Li Hsiung , executive director of the Taipei Elders ' Foundation . He feels that the growing prevalence of problems involving the elderly ca n't simply be attributed to a lack of filial piety on the part of their children . He says that the major factors are rather changes in lifestyle and in the family structure .  
" For every ten people who come to me for authentication , nine end up disappointed and leave mad , " says Ted Cheng , executive manager of Buddhist Chen De Plaza , who helped to stir up the rage for dZi beads in the early days and became famous last year when he was commissioned to make a gold throne for the Dalai Lama to use in Taiwan . As reproduction techniques in Taiwan have improved , fakes have flooded the market , throwing it into turmoil .  
Edwin Yen was a pioneer who was studying and promoting sex education for schoolchildren as long as 20 years ago ; he is now director of the Health Education Department at NTNU and executive director of the Mercy Memorial Foundation . He points out that in the past the education system was conservative . Sex was considered to be dirty and vulgar , not worthy of the halls of knowledge . Children were left to find out for themselves as best they could .  
Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
Huang Cheng-hsiung , executive director of World Vision Taiwan , says that people fell over themselves to take in the orphans created by the earthquake , but the elderly got scant help . The main reason is that children who lost both parents received NT $ 2 million in death benefit , whereas most old people whose children died received no benefit since their children were already married .  
During the months leading up to the presidential election in March , non-cable TV stations China Television Company ( CTV ) , Taiwan Television ( TTV ) , and China Television System ( CTS ) were roundly criticized for biased and unbalanced reporting . There were reports that a senior executive at one of these stations actually issued an order to go all out in support of the ruling party . He reportedly said , " For the next three months , we do n't want you paying any attention to the ratings . "  
But county executive Chen Shui-tsai , who was in the military for decades and maintains close contacts with the local defense command , says that while he understands the importance of military security , people must recognize that Kinmen 's role has changed from that of defender to communicator . The military , he says , will simply have to make the necessary adjustments to coordinate with the implementation of the little three links . " The security-related measures chosen by the Ministry of Defense will be key to the smooth implementation of the little three links . "  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
The construction budget for the new terminal at CKS Airport , which opened in July , included a public art allocation of NT $ 100 million . Deciding how to handle this huge sum proved a difficult task for the project 's executive committee . Many people questioned whether public art has to be limited to the installation of permanent " works of art . "  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
This was the observation of Tsai Hsin-hsin , executive director of the Liao Chiung-chih Taiwanese Opera Foundation . According to Tsai , mainland Chinese actors alternate between falsetto and their natural register . They incorporate various techniques from Peking Opera and Western opera . The mainland Chinese vocal and acting styles are very standardized .  
New legislators will be sworn in on February 1 , 2002 . Until then the political situation will remain murky . In recent days Executive Yuan secretary-general Chiou I-jen has again proposed revising the Constitution to create a presidential system , or to create a genuine " dual executive " system ( the system used in France ) , in order to once and for all resolve constitutional power struggles between the executive and legislative bodies .  
The main offerings to Lu 's spirit were the " five treasures of the artisan " ( various measuring devices , markers , and tools ) , while artworks were set on every table as additional offerings . The seriousness with which the ritual was taken is evidenced by the fact that a central government official-Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Liu Wann-hong-served as master of ceremonies , with the Changhua County executive and the mayor of Lukang as his seconds .  
Full of enthusiasm for this plan , Hsien Wen-chu specially returned to Taiwan to visit NCF executive director Rebecca Wang , but the response he received was a disheartening one . Wang said that because at the time there was an intense public debate going in Taiwan about the need for charities to use funds for the purpose for which they had been donated , and donors to the NCF had not explicitly stated that their donations were to be used for overseas assistance , the foundation had to be cautious in how it used its funds .  
So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious . Recently the Government Information Office announced the results of an investigation into the running of electronic media by holders of public office . It shows that among 366 such media outlets , 67 elected or executive branch officials are board members , managers , stockholders , or founders .  
According to Clio Chi , executive director of the Eastern Culture Foundation , once given the opportunity to show their talent , Aboriginal children invariably end up surprising everybody . After the foundation started funding Paling Elementary School , a school in Taoyuan County attended by Aboriginal children , that school 's website soon took first place in a nationwide contest and even became an outlet for online sales of the peaches grown on Lala Mountain , thus helping to spearhead local economic development .  
Moreover , both governing and opposition parties endorsed the ideal of a nuclear-free homeland as a long-term goal , with the executive and legislative branches reaching formal agreement on this point on October 13 , 2001 . In 2002 , the Legislative Yuan formally codified a nuclear-free homeland as a strategic objective when it passed the Environmental Basic Law .  
The soft-spoken Lee studied sociology at university , and for more than 20 years has built his career around social work . In the 1990s , while running an Ilan halfway house , he also began training as a counselor to better help people deal with psychological disorders . Lee then returned to his hometown of Tungshan in 1997 and established a counseling center . In 1999 , Tungshan attempted to hold an election for the position of executive director , but no one wanted to run .  
" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
" In our more than ten years of service we have been deeply moved by the unfortunate situation created by international marriages . The harm and lasting effects on women and children is truly frightful and difficult to gauge accurately , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The government should set up an appropriate system of preventative measures , she says , but in the end , family problems must be solved by the families themselves .  
Thinking back on his career as a local official , Lin says that as the representative of the county executive and spokesperson for the county government , he was tied down by countless details and small tasks . He would often be awakened by phone calls in the middle of the night-having just got to sleep after yet another busy day . His life , previously lived amidst books and with quiet time for contemplation , was now continually interrupted by odds and ends .  
As the association 's executive director Huang Jui-chiang points out , the full 12-kilometer length of Highway 7C had been divided into 13 sections , each with their own name , which had long confused visitors from outside the area . Taking this into consideration , the county government proposed earlier this year to rename the entire highway " Parisa Road , " but this proposal met with strong opposition . Caught between a rock and a hard place , the county government decided to open the proposal to public submissions .  
After eight years of hard work laying the foundation for the company , artkey executive vice-president Ivan Fan surveys the current scene and gives her analysis . After mainland China joined the World Trade Organization , intellectual property on both sides of the strait benefited from increased international protection . At the same time , another " East Asia fever " is set to grip the world as we come up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .  
Eddington , the airline 's chief executive , said : " The airline market is expected to remain weak but the quick and decisive actions we have taken have shown we are determined to return the business to acceptable levels of profitability . "

Having taken up his difficult and demanding tasks at a particularly important time in the history of the United Nations , Mr . Boutros-Ghali has shown himself , throughout his term of office , to be not only an outstanding intellectual capable of theorizing and conceptualizing problems and of thinking before acting , but also a man of action capable of taking timely decisions on the most difficult issues that every day come before the chief executive of the United Nations .  
Although the United Nations Environment Programme was an important step forward for the protection of the biosphere , consideration should be given the possibility of creating , after proper study , an ecological response embodied in a United Nations environmental security council composed of Member States with a permanent 15-member executive committee and a secretary-general with executive powers .

Wu Kuang-ting , for many years secretary of overseas Chinese affairs at the ROC embassy , explains : " There are three such chief justices in Panama , each nominated by the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government respectively . Because they are responsible for overseeing the elections they must enjoy impeccable reputations . That Luis Chen was the nomination of the executive branch shows how highly he was regarded by the former government . "  
From being elected to the Legislative Yuan with the highest number of votes in the country , to his " change in careers " to become an executive branch official , Environmental Protection Administration Director Jaw Shau-kong has used his broad public support as his shield in undertaking the work of protecting the environment . Although he has run up against counterattacks from polluting industries and is seen as wreaking havoc in the " political ecology , " he has for this very reason accumulated even greater political resources : constituent support .  
However , the ownership of the publishing rights overseas is rather complex . Sometimes the rights belong to the writer , sometimes to the publishing house , and sometimes to an agent . " If you 're not familiar with the terrain , for publishers without any experience negotiating international publishing rights , it is very easy to look in the wrong places for partners , " says Luc Kwanten , executive vice president of the Big Apple Tuttle-Mori Agency , which has been operating for five years .  
In our original conception , there would be nine items for evaluation - - those being , besides the eight main powers of legislators , also adding one item for " constituent service . " There are four criteria for evaluation - - whether the legislator effectively promotes a balance with the executive ; whether the legislator 's attitude in interpellations is reasonable ; the extent to which expressed political views are realized in practice ; and whether or not the legislator follows the constitution . ( However , we do n't include ideology . )  
Local enterprises are still not very enthused about international strategic alliances , and they do n't understand them very well , " says Huang Hsiao - kuan , executive director of the business alliance group .

" Not only do both sides have to have suitable manpower , technology , and capital to be mutually attractive , they need comparable international perspectives and internationalization experience before they can really communicate .  
Wu is the executive director of the foundation and its painful opening announcement was like a short summary of his work : " The Chinese Communists established the reform-through-labor brigades some 40 years ago . Their inmates still include so-called counter-revolutionaries , class enemies , those deemed to be against the party and socialism , religious figures , " historical " counter-revolutionaries and members of the Tienanmen democracy movement .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .  
Not long ago , Taipei County executive You Ching wanted to hire Lin Yu-yi , a professor from National Normal University ( the elite teaching university ) , as director of the county Bureau of Education . The provincial government rejected him on the grounds that his qualifications were not suitable , and assigned someone else . This led to a conflict over which appointee should take office , and for a time relations between the two sides were strained .  
This is still far removed from Chen Tingnan 's ideal for a " county cabinet , " in which all top administrators come and go with the executive , need not be approved by the provincial government , and are not bound by the civil service regulations on qualifications but are seen as political appointees . But at least it 's some improvement .  
Wang Hsing-ching observes that most people are far less ready to accept an aboriginal at the head of an administration than as a councillor , provincial assembly member or other elected representative , " for such representatives only represent their minority community , but the local chief executive represents a whole county or city , including the Han Chinese as well as the ' native people . ' '  
After being returned to China , Taiwan was kept apart and given a special status because the mainland had not returned to a state of normalcy . Administration was placed in the hands of a single " hsing-cheng chang-kuan " appointed by the central government . This term is generally rendered into English as " governor , " but its literal translation is " chief executive official . " Meanwhile , other aspects of life in Taiwan - - such as the currency , rationing , and so on - - were also different from the mainland .  
Kwong Chi-hung , general manager of the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company , believes that only technical adjustments will be needed in textbooks to cope with political changes . Phrases that smack of colonialism can be altered .

"  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
The nation 's second highest official furtively flying off to foreign soil to engage in " secret diplomacy " brought varying reactions : Some members of the media described his departure as a virtually supernatural " disappearance , " and the opposition questioned if such a mission was n't better suited to a secret ambassador than a high-ranking executive official , at least until there was a major foreign-relations breakthrough with Ukraine .  
The central level reform issues came up first . Even before the conference began , the KMT 's dual executive mixed system idea was being attacked on all sides .

Some boldly declared that the proposal was simply intended to pave the way for Lee Teng-hui to run for re-election .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down .

In looking toward all of the preparations for the handover , those relating to government-including the establishment of the Basic Law and the holding of elections , the building of the airport , and even the appointment of the special administrative region 's chief executive and the arrival of the People 's Liberation Army-all have been accomplished . People 's private responses to the turnover-including the rush to get second passports , the return flow of emigrants , the real-estate boom-these too have already happened . Will there be big changes in the future ?  
In the days leading up to the takeover , one periodically reads of incoming chief executive Tung Chee-hwa admonishing Hong Kong people : Confucian culture must be strengthened , civic education is very valuable , family values must be reconstructed .  
" Those of us engaged in social work appreciate that there is a difference between the ideal and the reality of the situation , " says Li Hsiung , executive director of the Taipei Elders ' Foundation .

" For every ten people who come to me for authentication , nine end up disappointed and leave mad , " says Ted Cheng , executive manager of Buddhist Chen De Plaza , who helped to stir up the rage for dZi beads in the early days and became famous last year when he was commissioned to make a gold throne for the Dalai Lama to use in Taiwan . As reproduction techniques in Taiwan have improved , fakes have flooded the market , throwing it into turmoil .  
Edwin Yen was a pioneer who was studying and promoting sex education for schoolchildren as long as 20 years ago ; he is now director of the Health Education Department at NTNU and executive director of the Mercy Memorial Foundation .

Children were left to find out for themselves as best they could .  
Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
Huang Cheng-hsiung , executive director of World Vision Taiwan , says that people fell over themselves to take in the orphans created by the earthquake , but the elderly got scant help .

During the months leading up to the presidential election in March , non-cable TV stations China Television Company ( CTV ) , Taiwan Television ( TTV ) , and China Television System ( CTS ) were roundly criticized for biased and unbalanced reporting .

But county executive Chen Shui-tsai , who was in the military for decades and maintains close contacts with the local defense command , says that while he understands the importance of military security , people must recognize that Kinmen 's role has changed from that of defender to communicator . The military , he says , will simply have to make the necessary adjustments to coordinate with the implementation of the little three links . " The security-related measures chosen by the Ministry of Defense will be key to the smooth implementation of the little three links . "  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe .

In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
The construction budget for the new terminal at CKS Airport , which opened in July , included a public art allocation of NT $ 100 million .

And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office .

This was the observation of Tsai Hsin-hsin , executive director of the Liao Chiung-chih Taiwanese Opera Foundation .

New legislators will be sworn in on February 1 , 2002 . Until then the political situation will remain murky .

The main offerings to Lu 's spirit were the " five treasures of the artisan " ( various measuring devices , markers , and tools ) , while artworks were set on every table as additional offerings . The seriousness with which the ritual was taken is evidenced by the fact that a central government official-Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Liu Wann-hong-served as master of ceremonies , with the Changhua County executive and the mayor of Lukang as his seconds .  
Full of enthusiasm for this plan , Hsien Wen-chu specially returned to Taiwan to visit NCF executive director Rebecca Wang , but the response he received was a disheartening one . Wang said that because at the time there was an intense public debate going in Taiwan about the need for charities to use funds for the purpose for which they had been donated , and donors to the NCF had not explicitly stated that their donations were to be used for overseas assistance , the foundation had to be cautious in how it used its funds .  
So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious .

According to Clio Chi , executive director of the Eastern Culture Foundation , once given the opportunity to show their talent , Aboriginal children invariably end up surprising everybody .

In 1999 , Tungshan attempted to hold an election for the position of executive director , but no one wanted to run .  
" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
" In our more than ten years of service we have been deeply moved by the unfortunate situation created by international marriages .

Thinking back on his career as a local official , Lin says that as the representative of the county executive and spokesperson for the county government , he was tied down by countless details and small tasks .

His life , previously lived amidst books and with quiet time for contemplation , was now continually interrupted by odds and ends .  
As the association 's executive director Huang Jui-chiang points out , the full 12-kilometer length of Highway 7C had been divided into 13 sections , each with their own name , which had long confused visitors from outside the area .

Caught between a rock and a hard place , the county government decided to open the proposal to public submissions .
