He is especially appreciative of the way older folks take care of their gongs . In a temple parade , direct exposure to the hot sun can get a gong too hot and foul up its sound . When this happens , the old folks will wipe a gong with a wet cloth and wait for it to cool before striking it .  
67-year-old Ku Teh-fu looks a bit like Father Time himself . He is a wisp of a man with many a tooth missing and skin burnished dark brown after years of working under the hot sun , but a mischievous smile hints at the young heart that beats inside him . Peering intently out of a pair of big , bright eyes , he exudes an unmistakable air of straightforwardness .  
In particular , the group lambasted the government for the NT $ 200 million it had spent in vain on a reconstruction plan designed by academics that was impossible to implement .

It called upon the government to put an end to the tradition of plans that are unfeasible and good for nothing but creating a lot of hot air .  
The freshly picked tips of Oolong tea , with their green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when steeped in hot water .

Her husband Li Chung-sheng , who was very accomplished at a wide range of Taiwanese Opera roles , died on stage when the gunpowder he was using for special stage effects accidentally exploded in his face . Sai herself later got into political hot water . Branded as a " capitalist roader , " she was thrown into jail for several months .  
However , it can not be denied that virtually all advanced capitalist countries operate national or local lotteries . Moreover , before Taiwan began public lotteries , illegal lotteries were already widespread ( and still exist ) , and even the stockmarket-itself a casino given the prevalence of " hot buys " and " insider information " - attracted huge number of " players . "  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
The Tatun volcanic episode ended 350,000 years ago , but in geologic terms the landscape is still young , and the geothermal activity persists . The area 's abundant rainfall trickles down into the underlying strata of quartz sandstone , an ideal aquifer which fills with hot groundwater .  
Meanwhile , the hot igneous rock combined with the heated underground water combined to form hydrothermal fluids , which , as result of the prevailing high temperature and high pressure , included large amounts of dissolved metals . After these fluids percolated upward through faults , as temperature and pressure declined , the metal ions percolated into cracks and into fissures in the surrounding rock . In the places where accumulations reached a certain volume , gold veins took shape . Bringing prosperity back  
And Taiwan has a special history , she explains . It has experienced colonization and imperialism and is a cosmopolitan place with strong ties to the rest of the world , but it also has the rich cultures of the Southern-Fujianese-speaking " Taiwanese , " the Mandarin-speaking mainlanders who arrived after the war , and its aboriginal tribes . " How can it not have abundant stories , emotions , conflicts , dreams and all the sweet , sour , bitter and hot that make up people 's lives ? "  
Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth . Ever since the Ming loyalist Koxinga ( Zheng Chenggong ) ruled over the island in the late 17th century , almost all Chinese-language scholarship on the subject has consisted of written tracts , with very few visual images . Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
" Wellness centers " tout their ability to stave off aging , and woo customers with scented hot spring baths , quartz sound wave therapy , and whole-body pummeling with contoured mallets .

Once rice wine became the main type of cooking wine in kitchens , it became part of virtually every dish and every style of cooking , from wok-frying , deep-fat-frying , and pan-frying to stewing , steaming , and sauteing . Great chefs can not do without rice wine , and this is even more true of eateries specializing in wintertime " tonic foods " like shaojiuji , ginger duck , and mutton hot pot , who literally use it like water to create stews that are at once relaxing and invigorating .  
After fulfilling his mandatory military service , Lin was reluctant to return to the bakery , but he could n't find any other work . He was n't happy with the thought of spending a life amidst flour and oil and standing next to a hot oven . He often switched jobs , shuttling between guest houses and leading a dissipated life .  
In any case , the domestic tourist economy is rapidly gaining ground after its precipitous fall and entrepreneurs feel like they have jumped from the cold pool at a hot springs straight into the hot pool , going from one extreme to the other . Aside from SARS receding into the background and the approach of the summer holiday season , a new-found unity among tourism entrepreneurs has been a key element in the rapid resurgence of the industry .  
Eight of the ten largest tourist agencies in Japan manage domestic tourism and depend solely on this market . Japan has managed the tourism industry with amazing skill . This is especially true for the hot springs areas popular with the silver-haired generation , where nature is combined with human artifice , places that can truly be described as " products of culture , " like the famous Hakone and Izu hot springs areas .  
They have opened up a walking path based on the one used by the girl in the great writer Yasunari Kawabata 's novel , The Dancing Girl of Izu . They have also decorated and made into an exhibition hall the inn that Kawabata frequented , as well as his favorite hot spring . To take advantage of the scenery along the route , railway cars have been refitted with surrounding glass enclosures better suited to appreciate the view . The railway cars alone have thus becomes a valuable tourist resource .  
But over the past few years Taiwan railroads have suddenly experienced a retro revival and have become quite the fashion . Colorful tourist trains started running during the Millennium Year , and all at once there was a complete change in style as the Neiwan , Chichi and Pinghsi branch lines and Alishan Forestry Railway became hot tourist attractions . Train tickets from the auspiciously named " Eternal Peace and Vigor " route have sold in the tens of thousands . Convenience stores began selling boxed lunch prepared just the way they used to be served on trains .  
Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control .

The Japanese , well acquainted with the curative effects of hot springs , were pleasantly surprised to discover Peitou 's hot springs whilst hunting down anti-Japanese rebels and collecting sulfur . In a short time , a hostel offering bathing pools for army use was built on the site , along with the Taipei Garrison Hospital , Recuperation Branch-both were completed with the same speed and quality of construction used in the other areas of Taipei and Peitou .  
In 1896 , Hirata Gengo came to Peitou on the recommendation of a friend . He originally came for the curative effects of the hot springs , but then established the first hot springs hotel , " Tengu Cabin . " After that , all kinds of luxurious and sophisticated establishments for visitors to the springs lined both banks of Peitou Creek . The common people , however , preferred to enjoy the hot springs via Peitou Creek 's open-air Tang Lung Bathing Pool .  
Although the oysters on the white porcelain dish were small , they gave off a rich aroma that the fat chunky oysters in Taiwan just do n't have . There was no starch , no sweet and hot sauce , no cabbage , just a simple platter of oysters and eggs , but still it tasted great . It was only then that I realized why the early immigrants to Taiwan were so deeply attached to ou-a-jian .  
Yushan National Park is crowded with peaks , and crisscrossed by river valleys , making the terrain highly varied . Additionally , vegetation zones with hot , warm , cool , and cold climates can be found at different altitudes . As a result , except for the tropical plants along the coast , virtually all the types of vegetation found in Taiwan can be observed . It is little wonder that Yushan is such a haven for botanical researchers .  
Lu Ming-fong says , " If we combine genetic research with traditional Chinese medicine we will make the road ahead much shorter . " Traditional Chinese medicine divides the human organism into the five different phases , or constitutions , of metal , wood , water , fire , and earth . Genes also show that different people have different constitutions . For example , it appears that people with cardiovascular diseases rarely get cancer , because heart disease is what Chinese medicine calls a " hot " condition , whereas cancer is a " cold " one .  
It was only then that I learned hot showers are regarded as an extravagance . On the very highest point of the north peak , the weather station is almost entirely dependent on rain and snowfall for its water . When the Japanese first built the station in 1943 they constructed a water storage tank in the basement , designed to hold ten tons of water . Unfortunately , the tank is now old and cracked , and leaks so badly it can only hold two or three tons at a time .  
The technician , responsible for recording the meteorological data , gets up at around 4:50 a.m . , and half an hour earlier in winter , because it is necessary to clean off the overnight rime that has coated the equipment , with hot water .  
To satisfy his colleagues , Ye Hung-hsien bought a pressure cooker , flexible steel tubing and a ready-made waterproof container bag to put together a sauna . After snow was melted and filtered you could take a nice comfortable hot bath amidst the ice and snow . If you wanted to toughen up your physique , then you could roll your steaming body on the snowy ground . This hot-and-cold shock treatment is a " super sauna " unmatched anywhere else in Taiwan .

Ironically , the charge was slave trading .  
Unless a new agricultural revolution is envisaged in the near future that would radically reduce the amount of water consumed in food production in hot countries ( currently about 3,000 cubic metres per ton of grain produced ) , it must be acknowledged as an urgent matter that there seems to be a definite limit to the human population that can be supported by the available water-supply .

Besides the matchmaking columns and programs popular in the media , an even greater number of specialized , commercialized " modern super matchmakers " are popping up everywhere .  
And hot money , one of the two main factors leading to the disaster of speculative fever ( along with surplus money in circulation ) , has come back to Taiwan . People are just waiting for the opportunity to have their golden dreams again by taking advantage of currency exchange , the stock market and real estate .  
During the warm period prior to the ice age , which is to say at the same time that the Han Chinese legend of Hou Yi ( who shot down nine of the ten suns with his bow and arrow ) was said to take place , the Taiya version has it that another sun appeared in the sky . There were two suns , one above and one below , so that the distinction between day and night was lost . The weather became oppressively hot , and illnesses spread rampantly ; all living things faced extinction .  
After being pulled from the oil , it is golden in color , crispy on the outside and tender inside . Its special flavor is matched with heavy flavorings like hot sauce , garlic , and vinegar . Or you can add some pickled vegetables .  
It 's got a strong smell when you 're eating it , and it 's packed with flavor too . The steamed stinky tofu in Chekiang restaurants is also very popular . It can be mixed with green beans or hot sauce and other flavorings .  
Today , succeeding to traditional tea houses , with modern beverage and packaging technology , it has finally broken through the traditional image of " old man tea " - of elderly gents sipping delicate little cups of hot tea - to display a startling potential for rebirth .  
Bob Yeh , managing director of the Meta Advertising Company , which handles the account for Shin Shii oolong tea , analyzes the reasons for failure at that time : First , Chinese who had long been accustomed to taking their tea hot could not immediately accept cold tea . There was a traditional belief that " tea left overnight produces poisons . " If tea is left to steep for a long time , it creates tannic acid , which causes the arteries to contract and makes digestion difficult .  
But in earlier years , the Pu'er produced in Yunnan was not aged enough , its taste was n't smooth , and its grade was n't high . Most people did n't know that Pu'er , unlike the teas grown in Taiwan , does n't like to be sealed up and should from time to time be brought out and aired . Otherwise , in a hot and humid climate , it easily molds and rots , making it quite literally a " stinky , moldy tea . "  
Early on in the era of Japanese occupation , Chihpen was an aboriginal dwelling place . The Japanese discovered , in the Chihpen stream between southern slopes of a mountain and the river bed , a natural hot spring , gushing out warm water . The water 's temperature was moderate ( between 45and 56 ) ; it had a dense concentration of hydrogen ions ( 7% to 8% ) . This was a very good spring , colorless , odorless , and only slightly salty .  
The famous fishballs and " iron eggs " ( eggs boiled in diluted soy sauce until small and hard ) attracted many customers , and the exhibits , books , magazines and other records of Tanshui 's history opened a window on the town 's past . The You Theater put on local opera performances in the streets , and to watch figures being blown from hot malt sugar was mouth-watering fun for adults and children alike . . . .  
But Taiwanese have turned out to be much more interested in watching sporting events than anyone had anticipated , and professional baseball is on a hot streak . The first year attendance was 899,955 , rising to l , 60O , 500 by the fourth year . With an average ticket costing NT $ 150 , total revenue reached more than NT $ 240 million .  
What a hot topic of conversation this has been over the ages ! One imaginative theory holds that dragons are bolts of lightning . As large numbers of dinosaur bones have been unearthed this century in China , views from a proper perspective of the more complete skeletons have given many a startling and eerie sense of recognition . If the Chinese painted the dragon based on an awe-inspiring subject and artists creatively enhanced their rendering of it , dinosaurs skeletons might just be what excited the imaginations of the ancient Chinese to depict dragons .  
To make kungtang , the peanuts are first fried , hulled , sorted and ground into a powder . The powder is then mixed with malt sugar and fine granulated sugar , and formed while still hot into a cake of crunchy peanut candy . This is dusted with more peanut powder , pressed flat and cut into chunks to make tasty kungtang , which is neither greasy nor sticky .  
Just a moment ago your bare arms and legs were a little numb from the cold air . Now they 're numb because the heat is making your blood vessels throb , and your whole body is limp . When you ca n't stand that hot current running through your body any longer , just splash yourself with some cold water .  
These volcanos went extinct about 350,000 years ago , but because that is quite recent in geological terms , a lot of heat remains . When this kind of heat is combined with ample deposits of sandstone , which are excellent holds for water , opportunities abound for water underground to warm up quickly . All said and done , it 's a " hot bed " for hot water .  
Each piece displayed a different character , depending upon the light , shape , and coloring . Each had a different story to tell , from cool and aloof to hot and passionate . People discovered to their great delight that the world of glass is a varied and colorful place .  
When cooking , the meat is first scalded in hot water and then immediately placed into cold water to cool it down , then slowly simmered over a low heat with a sachet of seasonings . Beef cooked in a clear broth in this way will be chewy and flavorsome , while the broth has a fresh meaty taste and there is no need at all to add MSG .  
When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
Coral reefs require clear , unpolluted water in shallow seas no deeper than 30 meters , so that the symbiotic algae can absorb enough light and the coral can feed on the organisms that float by . If the water 's too hot or too cold the coral will die . Warm waters of 20-30 year round are most suitable . The salinity of the water must be above 0.25% , and so reefs can not be close to the mouth of a river .  
It 's a long read homeThe weather tended to be hot and dry , and the road went from being asphalt or grass to an uneven stone surface , strewn with pot-holes . As they rushed their journey both day and night , the elephants ' feet quickly blistered and tore , even becoming infected and festering .  
This is the time of year when the weather is affected by cold high-pressure areas from the continent . These create sharp differences in temperature , generating strong upward currents . Also , humidity is low , and there is less concern about rain caused by hot air currents running into cold air at high altitudes .  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket . He was curious , and we felt joyful inside watching him . Here , the Lunar New Year is a special celebration for Chinese people , not a public holiday with time off from work .  
The first time that I had written and delivered a speech in Mandarin . The first time that I had attended a Christian church service conducted entirely in Mandarin . The first time that I had celebrated Chinese New Year with my relatives in Taoyuan complete with hot pot ( huo guo ) , sticky rice cake ( nian gao ) , and a lucky red envelope ( hong bao ) . The first time that I had attended a traditional Chinese wedding .  
This time the main technical challenge was one of climate : Taiwan 's wet , sub-tropical climate differs vastly from the alternately humid and dry , cold and hot climate of southern Australia . But at least it has continual moisture , which does n't do as much damage as punctuated moisture .  
Using hot springs water to irrigate water convoluvus makes it grow to great size without being overripe . The sponge gourds are plump and firm , and they wo n't go dark when cooked . The whites of the water oats are really white , and the greens truly green with absolutely no black bit at the core .  
Liang Chiungpai notes that not only do pickled veggies keep well for a long time , they come in many flavors , covering the gamut from sour and salty to sweet and hot ; they also help relieve that bloated feeling . Available to both rich and poor alike , and appropriate for both holidays and ordinary meals , these little appetizers are eminently suited to accompany fine cuisine .  
Anyone who has eaten kimche before might have an idea what to expect in Korean vegetarian cooking . The variety of vegetables is simple ; and steaming , boiling , and scalding are the most common cooking techniques . Oil is not often used , with sugar , soy sauce , sesame oil , hot peppers , and garlic-all ( save sugar ) powerful acrid flavorings-being preferred . Jung really enjoys this style , and feels that these are simple vegetarian recipes that people can use for a long time without getting tired of them .  
A large quantity of related products have one after the other become hot items in the marketplace . More than a few products which have nothing to do with the subject have been decorated with irrelevant " EQs . " Experts and famous public figures have been frequently invited to discuss the merits of EQ on TV and radio , and to speak at meetings and activities , exhibiting " feats of EQ . " As a matter of course , the " EQ fad " has swept into the realm of children 's education .  
Since appearing in Taiwan last Novem-ber , the book A Great Revolution in the Brain World has hit the spot with modern people living with " diseases of civilization . " It uses a mix of accessible language and medical evidence to propose an approach to health and longevity . This book became especially hot after NHK did a TV documentary series based on it . Bookstores sold out their copies in a week .  
Modern radio people are a diverse group : senior broadcaster Luo Hsiao-yun often hosts press conferences for pop stars ( top left ) ; Su Lai , who was originally a pop star himself , likes radio work because he gets to play music and talk about his emotions ( bottom left ) ; Li Ming-jou , a hot young radio show host , makes a commercial endorsement ( above ) .  
As the southern weather turns hot and stuffy , the ducks , missing the spring breezes which they need for their breeding season , grow bored and their hormones subside . At the same time , spring is gradually spreading across the north , melting the Earth 's icy veil . With natural enemies there few in number but food plentiful , one after the other the ducks and geese start to return home .  
The Japanese were the first to lay roads into the region in order to crush anti-Japanese resistance on Mt . Tsao . Stumbling upon the volcanic topography , they built the hot spring baths for which the whole area from Mt . Tsao to Peitou would become famous . From 1924 , the Japanese began an effort to " create a forest on Mt . Tatun . " They also encouraged local farmers to set up nurseries , which are the forerunners of the flower farms visited by tourists today .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
Steaming and bubbling , boiling water is poured into a little teapot , then the water-which for the first pouring is only designed to warm up and wash the tea leaves-is poured out . The tea server then opens the little pot and allows his or her guests to look at the tea leaves that have just been soaked by the hot water . The still not yet fully opened tea leaves have a slightly burnt fragrance ; you can imagine what it must have been like when they were being dried over an open fire .  
All the women who volunteer their services at Hsing Tien Temple understand that they can not go to the temple during their menstrual period . A common sight at temple festivals in Taiwan is the jitong , or spirit medium , who defies nature by piercing his body and walking over hot coals without bleeding or blistering .  
In the early days they paid little attention to decor-in fact the more ramshackle the premises , the less they cost . Before they had electric ovens , they would bake the shaobing in makeshift furnaces made from a large earthenware water pot set inside an oil drum with the top cut off . They would light a charcoal fire inside the pot , and when the coals were glowing and the pot was hot they would stick the shaobing against the inside of the pot to bake .  
These would then be displayed in front of the home to ward off bad fortune and evil spirits . The people of ancient Japan would also gather medicinal herbs to prevent illness . These customs remain alive today . The Japanese have a May 5th custom of eating kashiwamochi ( rice cakes filled with sweet bean paste and wrapped in oak leaves ) and soaking in a hot tub or hot spring filled with iris leaves .  
On the evening of October 22 , the late autumn air of Taipei was just a little chilly , but the plaza in front of the Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall was hot and teeming with people . More than 10,000 music fans were crowded together , some sitting , some standing , all waiting for the concert " Nature and Hope : A Voyage to Paradise . " The show was a benefit concert for the Eden Foundation , to help those who were left physically handicapped by the Sept . 21 earthquake .  
The most important of these are duck blood and tofu , popularly known as " red and white tofu " because the cakes of cooked duck blood have a similar texture to tofu . These must be fresh and clean , firm on the outside but tender on the inside , and the tofu in particular should be slab tofu made in the traditional way , because it absorbs the soup , so that when one bites into it the hot , spicy , flavorsome stock immediately gushes out , filling one 's mouth .  
He is especially appreciative of the way older folks take care of their gongs . In a temple parade , direct exposure to the hot sun can get a gong too hot and foul up its sound . When this happens , the old folks will wipe a gong with a wet cloth and wait for it to cool before striking it .  
67-year-old Ku Teh-fu looks a bit like Father Time himself . He is a wisp of a man with many a tooth missing and skin burnished dark brown after years of working under the hot sun , but a mischievous smile hints at the young heart that beats inside him . Peering intently out of a pair of big , bright eyes , he exudes an unmistakable air of straightforwardness .  
In particular , the group lambasted the government for the NT $ 200 million it had spent in vain on a reconstruction plan designed by academics that was impossible to implement . They argued that the new government 's chief concerns should instead be with practical measures such as instituting work management controls and tracking down how reconstruction money was embezzled after the quake . It called upon the government to put an end to the tradition of plans that are unfeasible and good for nothing but creating a lot of hot air .  
The freshly picked tips of Oolong tea , with their green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when steeped in hot water . Whether sold domestically or exported , Pinglin 's Pouchong tea enjoys a wide market and good distribution channels . Both superior and inferior grades of tea bring a good return , and so for 90% of the people of Pinglin , life revolves around tea .  
Her husband Li Chung-sheng , who was very accomplished at a wide range of Taiwanese Opera roles , died on stage when the gunpowder he was using for special stage effects accidentally exploded in his face . Sai herself later got into political hot water . Branded as a " capitalist roader , " she was thrown into jail for several months .  
However , it can not be denied that virtually all advanced capitalist countries operate national or local lotteries . Moreover , before Taiwan began public lotteries , illegal lotteries were already widespread ( and still exist ) , and even the stockmarket-itself a casino given the prevalence of " hot buys " and " insider information " - attracted huge number of " players . "  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
The Tatun volcanic episode ended 350,000 years ago , but in geologic terms the landscape is still young , and the geothermal activity persists . The area 's abundant rainfall trickles down into the underlying strata of quartz sandstone , an ideal aquifer which fills with hot groundwater .  
Meanwhile , the hot igneous rock combined with the heated underground water combined to form hydrothermal fluids , which , as result of the prevailing high temperature and high pressure , included large amounts of dissolved metals . After these fluids percolated upward through faults , as temperature and pressure declined , the metal ions percolated into cracks and into fissures in the surrounding rock . In the places where accumulations reached a certain volume , gold veins took shape . Bringing prosperity back  
And Taiwan has a special history , she explains . It has experienced colonization and imperialism and is a cosmopolitan place with strong ties to the rest of the world , but it also has the rich cultures of the Southern-Fujianese-speaking " Taiwanese , " the Mandarin-speaking mainlanders who arrived after the war , and its aboriginal tribes . " How can it not have abundant stories , emotions , conflicts , dreams and all the sweet , sour , bitter and hot that make up people 's lives ? "  
Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth . Ever since the Ming loyalist Koxinga ( Zheng Chenggong ) ruled over the island in the late 17th century , almost all Chinese-language scholarship on the subject has consisted of written tracts , with very few visual images . Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
" Wellness centers " tout their ability to stave off aging , and woo customers with scented hot spring baths , quartz sound wave therapy , and whole-body pummeling with contoured mallets . They stress that these therapies can adjust slight lopsidedness or other deformations of the spine caused by modern people 's poor posture , thus restoring mental and physical balance .  
Once rice wine became the main type of cooking wine in kitchens , it became part of virtually every dish and every style of cooking , from wok-frying , deep-fat-frying , and pan-frying to stewing , steaming , and sauteing . Great chefs can not do without rice wine , and this is even more true of eateries specializing in wintertime " tonic foods " like shaojiuji , ginger duck , and mutton hot pot , who literally use it like water to create stews that are at once relaxing and invigorating .  
After fulfilling his mandatory military service , Lin was reluctant to return to the bakery , but he could n't find any other work . He was n't happy with the thought of spending a life amidst flour and oil and standing next to a hot oven . He often switched jobs , shuttling between guest houses and leading a dissipated life .  
In any case , the domestic tourist economy is rapidly gaining ground after its precipitous fall and entrepreneurs feel like they have jumped from the cold pool at a hot springs straight into the hot pool , going from one extreme to the other . Aside from SARS receding into the background and the approach of the summer holiday season , a new-found unity among tourism entrepreneurs has been a key element in the rapid resurgence of the industry .  
Eight of the ten largest tourist agencies in Japan manage domestic tourism and depend solely on this market . Japan has managed the tourism industry with amazing skill . This is especially true for the hot springs areas popular with the silver-haired generation , where nature is combined with human artifice , places that can truly be described as " products of culture , " like the famous Hakone and Izu hot springs areas .  
They have opened up a walking path based on the one used by the girl in the great writer Yasunari Kawabata 's novel , The Dancing Girl of Izu . They have also decorated and made into an exhibition hall the inn that Kawabata frequented , as well as his favorite hot spring . To take advantage of the scenery along the route , railway cars have been refitted with surrounding glass enclosures better suited to appreciate the view . The railway cars alone have thus becomes a valuable tourist resource .  
But over the past few years Taiwan railroads have suddenly experienced a retro revival and have become quite the fashion . Colorful tourist trains started running during the Millennium Year , and all at once there was a complete change in style as the Neiwan , Chichi and Pinghsi branch lines and Alishan Forestry Railway became hot tourist attractions . Train tickets from the auspiciously named " Eternal Peace and Vigor " route have sold in the tens of thousands . Convenience stores began selling boxed lunch prepared just the way they used to be served on trains .  
Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control . As a result , not only do local people not reap benefits , but in the process the natural environment on which they depend for their living is damaged .  
The Japanese , well acquainted with the curative effects of hot springs , were pleasantly surprised to discover Peitou 's hot springs whilst hunting down anti-Japanese rebels and collecting sulfur . In a short time , a hostel offering bathing pools for army use was built on the site , along with the Taipei Garrison Hospital , Recuperation Branch-both were completed with the same speed and quality of construction used in the other areas of Taipei and Peitou .  
In 1896 , Hirata Gengo came to Peitou on the recommendation of a friend . He originally came for the curative effects of the hot springs , but then established the first hot springs hotel , " Tengu Cabin . " After that , all kinds of luxurious and sophisticated establishments for visitors to the springs lined both banks of Peitou Creek . The common people , however , preferred to enjoy the hot springs via Peitou Creek 's open-air Tang Lung Bathing Pool .  
Although the oysters on the white porcelain dish were small , they gave off a rich aroma that the fat chunky oysters in Taiwan just do n't have . There was no starch , no sweet and hot sauce , no cabbage , just a simple platter of oysters and eggs , but still it tasted great . It was only then that I realized why the early immigrants to Taiwan were so deeply attached to ou-a-jian .  
Yushan National Park is crowded with peaks , and crisscrossed by river valleys , making the terrain highly varied . Additionally , vegetation zones with hot , warm , cool , and cold climates can be found at different altitudes . As a result , except for the tropical plants along the coast , virtually all the types of vegetation found in Taiwan can be observed . It is little wonder that Yushan is such a haven for botanical researchers .  
Lu Ming-fong says , " If we combine genetic research with traditional Chinese medicine we will make the road ahead much shorter . " Traditional Chinese medicine divides the human organism into the five different phases , or constitutions , of metal , wood , water , fire , and earth . Genes also show that different people have different constitutions . For example , it appears that people with cardiovascular diseases rarely get cancer , because heart disease is what Chinese medicine calls a " hot " condition , whereas cancer is a " cold " one .  
It was only then that I learned hot showers are regarded as an extravagance . On the very highest point of the north peak , the weather station is almost entirely dependent on rain and snowfall for its water . When the Japanese first built the station in 1943 they constructed a water storage tank in the basement , designed to hold ten tons of water . Unfortunately , the tank is now old and cracked , and leaks so badly it can only hold two or three tons at a time .  
The technician , responsible for recording the meteorological data , gets up at around 4:50 a.m . , and half an hour earlier in winter , because it is necessary to clean off the overnight rime that has coated the equipment , with hot water .  
To satisfy his colleagues , Ye Hung-hsien bought a pressure cooker , flexible steel tubing and a ready-made waterproof container bag to put together a sauna . After snow was melted and filtered you could take a nice comfortable hot bath amidst the ice and snow . If you wanted to toughen up your physique , then you could roll your steaming body on the snowy ground . This hot-and-cold shock treatment is a " super sauna " unmatched anywhere else in Taiwan .  
" It is beneficial to all countries to enhance regional and international financial cooperation , maintain normal international financial order , jointly ward off the impact of excessive speculation of hot money in the world and create a favorable financial environment , " the Chinese leader said  
Liberia , which was founded about half a century before the Berlin Congress of 1884 , which carved out Africa and institutionalized colonialism as an asylum for free people of colour fleeing the hot crucibles and bitter pangs of slavery , was threatened with partition and trusteeship by the League of Nations , predecessor to our beloved United Nations , half a century after that colonial Congress . Ironically , the charge was slave trading .  
Unless a new agricultural revolution is envisaged in the near future that would radically reduce the amount of water consumed in food production in hot countries ( currently about 3,000 cubic metres per ton of grain produced ) , it must be acknowledged as an urgent matter that there seems to be a definite limit to the human population that can be supported by the available water-supply . 
Thus , the rapid demographic growth of some cities and the movements of landless farm workers in hot , rainy ecosystems are extreme examples of the critical links that exist between demographic dynamics and the natural environment .  
Two recent assessments for industrialized countries have included specified functions such as recreation , conservation , protection , hunting and grazing , and for each have shown the total forest area broken down into importance classes - high , medium and low .  It has also given a verbal account of " hot " political issues .  
At police stations , the forms of torture and ill-treatment reported include kicking ; beating ; application of electric shocks by means of batons or small electrical generators ; the use of self-tightening handcuffs ; deprivation of food ; exposure to alternating extremes of hot and cold temperatures ; enforced standing in difficult positions ; enforced standing in cold water ; prolonged shackling of detainees spread-eagled to a wall ; placing of heated objects on the skin ; and striking with iron rods on the joints or hands .  
Provision of up-to-date and relevant information on emerging regional and global issues and potential environmental threats likely to lead to potential conflicts , critical hot spots or emergency situations , as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
In the southern camps overseen by IFRC , a water and sanitation programme provided camp residents with approximately 20 litres of potable water a day , additional water for weekly hot showers and , for every 20 inhabitants , a latrine which is cleaned daily and pumped out monthly .  
It includes purchase of one digital satellite ( hot standby ) terminal , one Optaphone digitally controlled rural telephone link system , four global positioning systems and the replacement of 30 base mobile transceivers .  
The digital satellite ( hot standby ) terminal is needed to replace the existing main analog terrestrial microwave link on Mount Olympus , which is an obsolete model for which maintenance is not cost-effective , and to extend the field assets control system , installed at UNFICYP headquarters in 1997 , to the three Sectors .  
Following positive reactions from a number of Governments and international organizations , BTF carried out a detailed feasibility study to define the exact scientific and associated financial requirements for the humanitarian cleanup of the hot spots .  
In view of the likelihood of a hot summer resulting from the criminal actions of extremist elements opposed to increased minority returns and the reconstruction of historic religious sites , my Special Representative is engaging intensively with political , religious and community leaders and police officials to seek a substantial improvement in their mutual cooperation as an essential element in improving police performance .
