Chou Chung-nan counters that most of the fishing boats involved in ferrying illegal mainland immigrants are worn-out and decrepit . Not many of them would be capable of making the voyage home , so there is a practical reason behind the policy of sending whole batches of deportees back on the same boat .  
Currently , the editors at Sinorama have set their three main directions as " the domestic pulse , " " traditional culture , " and " overseas reports , " in order to serve as a link for the aspirations of Chinese home and abroad and to truly become a comprehensive and international publication which " has its footing in Taiwan , is concerned about the mainland , and has its eyes open to the world .

When I was very little , I often heard some old folks mention a Place called Kuoyeh , on the east shores of Penghu [ the principal island of the Penghuarchipelago , traditionally referred to in English as the Pescadores ] . At dawnwhen the weather is good , one can stand on the east edge of the village and gazing across the distant waters catch a glimpse of the towering mountains of the main island of Taiwan , rising up to the east .  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
On main thoroughfares and in little lanes , in supermarkets , in record stores , in taxicabs . . . . everywhere you turn you can hear her sweet voice resonating : The singing has stopped Drink a final cup of wine I chat and talk of anything To ease your troubled mind Life has few opportunities for intoxication Why not look forward to them ?  
Afternoon tea in large hotels is served at prices ranging from NT $ 350 to NT $ 550 , and the accompanying buffet dishes range from Chinese style meat-filled zongzi , chicken wings and steamed dumplings , to Western-style smoked salmon , toasted cheese and caviar ; every one a main dish .  
The furo bathroom , with which she is most satisfied , is separate from the main living area , and connects with the storeroom . It does not have an ordinary bathtub , but is dominated by a big traditional wooden tub , which keeps the water warm longer . There is also space for the big kitchen stove and the wood it burns .  
Huang Sheng-yuan had thought that his own main ideas for the design , such as the many semi-outdoor areas around the house for people to linger or chat , the sloping roofs , the use of the terrazzo-type floors distinctive of the Lanyang area , and the features drawn from traditional building experience such as the heavy wooden protective boards on the eaves and the typhoon shutters on the Windows , would fit in well with e family 's wishes .  
Therefore , over the last ten years , the three Peking opera troupes went on fewer and fewer military entertainment missions . The main mission of the troupes became entertaining at veteran 's homes , participating in the annual national drama competition and performing for the public .  
The Formosan landlocked salmon was the main reason for the establishment of Shei-Pa National Park ; the Formosan clouded leopard was fielded by the newly formed Green Party as its presidential candidate ; and NT $ 200 million has been spent on the rehabilitation of the Formosan sika deer . But by the ecological definition , because these three species ' wild populations are so small that they can no longer reproduce healthily , in effect they are already extinct .  
This type of technology does n't require the user to have any special input-output devices to block out the real environment . Instead it employs the so-called " blueboard technique " using cameras . It makes a composite of images shot of the user along with computer generated virtual world images so that people can see themselves acting within the setting on the screen . One use for this is already visible in the weather programs of Taiwan 's three main TV stations .  
Anyone holding an outdoor activity in rainy northern Taiwan has to depend on fate to make any money . So the main reason for choosing Taoyuan for the inauguration was the venue 's special feature : The transparent " sky tent " that can keep out the elements while allowing natural sunlight in , thus insuring that the event would not be rained out or blown off course .  
According to Turtles of the World , which was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1989 , excessive culling , along with highway construction in developed countries , is a main reason turtle and tortoise populations are now facing a general crisis . In particular , the trade in turtles as meat and pets is booming as never before . With tortoises and turtles of large and small species alike being adopted as pets or turned into culinary delicacies , there 's no way for these chelonians to fulfill their duty of passing on their genetic legacy .  
The clock tower 's main structure comprised three levels . The upper level bore an armillary sphere , used for astronomical observations ; on the middle level was a celestial globe , which displayed the movements of celestial bodies ; while on the bottom level were wooden mannikins which struck the time of day . The whole formed " a single mechanism , turned by the power of water , without human effort . "  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
The songs of the Ami can be traced back to their fishing , farming , and hunting activities in the mountains and along the coast . In their tightly organized villages , through the annual harvest festival , each successive generation was trained and educated in cultural traditions , which is the main reason these songs have been carried forward .  
This time the main technical challenge was one of climate : Taiwan 's wet , sub-tropical climate differs vastly from the alternately humid and dry , cold and hot climate of southern Australia . But at least it has continual moisture , which does n't do as much damage as punctuated moisture .  
Americans are condemned as ignoramuses living in a country that somehow manages to be both immature and degenerate . Japan is dismissed as a naive child with a fat body and a small brain under American occupation . The British are unfortunately represented by a debauched Oxford graduate whose main occupation seems to be standing up women in Thailand and mainland China .  
Speaking of his 40-year quest to recreate the wooden ox , Wang Jian comments : " I have loved mechanical toys ever since I was a child . When I learned the story of the wooden ox I began making one out of cardboard and wood . I began drawing designs at middle school , and continued thinking on the subject at university , where I read mechanical engineering . My main sources were " Making the Wooden Ox " from Zhuge Liang 's Collected Works , and the documentary records of Zu Chongzhi . "  
My main work at the center has involved taking on psychological counseling cases , and serving as a group leader of empathy and self-affirmation groups , and emotional management groups for single-parent elementary school students . Accompanying people through their low times and sharing life experiences with them is a hard-to-come-by opportunity in this age when people lack ties to others .  
In 1980 , when the North Link Railway was completed , this stretch of track , essential for connecting the east and west coast main lines , became even more important . The single track was turned into a double track , and many of the old single-track tunnels were taken out of service . Now they are objects of our explorations .  
While the rates of adjustment varied , they could be as high as 100% - for example , the fee for " partial liver removal " was raised from NT $ 4000-plus to NT $ 8000-plus . As for complaints by surgeons that they are " low-wage labor , " Parng states that in the future the main focus of adjustments in universal health insurance pay schedules will be on respecting doctors ' special skills .  
Meanwhile , the main regulations governing Taiwan 's relations with Hong Kong have been largely completed . July 1997 will not merely be a starting point for Tung and the people of Hong Kong . Taiwanese , mainland Chinese , overseas Chinese , and Asia-watchers everywhere are waiting with bated breath . Tung is indeed bearing an unprecedented historical burden .  
Chen Chienchun , chief chef for vegetarian dishes , points out that not only do fungi have a fresh and distinct taste , they are very nutritious , and many rare types effectively promote longevity . That 's why he likes to design resplendent main courses using exotic edible fungi : " That 's what it takes to fit the bill at a firstclass hotel , " he says .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down . The main reason was the powerful obstruction of the " male outlook . "  
The idea that one can accumulate merit through charity is part of the traditional Chinese concept that deeds ( good or bad ) will earn their just desserts . Prior to the modern volunteer conception of " finding joy through helping others , " the idea of " gaining merit for the nether world " was long the main motive force to encourage ordinary people to do good .  
Chiang Han-kuang believes that in actuality the main purpose for promoting EQ is to teach everyone to pay attention to emotional and psychological health , to understand individual personalities , to become more mature and stable and to maintain a balance between the body and the mind . The point should be to pursue the true meaning of health and happiness , not such superficial viewpoints as distinguishing EQ grades or gaining advantages .  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
The main reasons for this are that with direct shipping most freight moving between the two sides will no longer need to be transshipped through Hong Kong . Scholars estimate that with direct shipping across the strait , the volume of cargo passing through Hong Kong will shrink by 1 million standard containers . Although this is less than one tenth of Hong Kong 's total volume , it will probably affect Hong Kong 's status as the world 's largest transshipment port .  
Her main hope now is revise the laws to meet the demands of the times , so that executive agencies can be more efficient . Film is another industry " guided " by the GIO . Though not as complex as the broadcast industry , it has its headaches as well , especially the poor economic returns on domestic films .  
Wang Chen-tai notes that early on there were factional conflicts , reducing the religion 's impact . Fortunately , he says , learned elders like Hsieh Sung-tao and Ting Chung-ming wrote inexhaustibly . Also , because of the importance of diplomatic ties with Islamic countries , the ROC government has strongly supported Muslims . The Taipei mosque , which has been the main spiritual and practical resource for Muslims in Taiwan for many years now , was built with government money in response to strong and far-sighted efforts by Ambassador Yeh Kung-chao .  
Opposite the main entrance , the spacious farmhouse boasts a wallful of award certificates and wooden plaques from friends : 1985 Taoyuan County Top Ten Farmers ; First Place , 1994 Organic Growers ' Exhibition ; 1995 Farm Entrepreneur of the Year . Just this year , Chuang was honored with Taiwan 's highest agricultural award , the " Shen Nong " award for his " leadership role in research and promotion of organic farming methods and production of safe , high-quality vegetables . "  
The main culprits causing newspaper publishers to feel panicky are familiar : the rising price of paper worldwide ; economic downturns ; and constantly improving electronic technology , so that newspapers find it harder and harder to be as timely as TV or radio .  
To fulfill an election promise to eliminate garbage from Taoyuan 's cities , County Executive Annette Lu has , first of all , applied to the EPA to build two inter-area incinerators which would be operational in four years . Secondly , she has asked 13 cities , townships and rural townships to build small-scale sanitary landfills , and permitted and aided towns in establishing small-scale incinerators and local dumps , which can serve as stop-gap measures before the main incinerators are built .  
The first book he ever bought himself was Stories from Chinese History . Later , when he studied at Chienkuo Boys High School , his happiest moments were browsing the second-hand book stores on Kuling Street with his classmates . This was a very popular place for literary youth of the 1960s and 70s to go . Reading books outside the main curriculum gave many people a rebellious or independent cast of mind , and cultivated many of today 's leading intellectuals and social elites .  
It is said that his main contribution was to cut down the large trees that shaded the grand avenues for the nouveaux riches , level the dwellings that had stood between them , smooth off the hill tops to make them into gentle slopes , and turn the rectangular lakes and canals into irregular expanses of water and small streams . Then he would make a snaking path on the expanse of grass and let loose a flock of sheep of just the right number .  
The Assembly session sparked contention throughout society : It touched on major issues of the power of the president and premier , and of the existence of the provincial government . There were divisions of opinion among and within the three main political parties . Scholars engaged in heated debate , and citizens took to the streets .  
What private sector publishing firms originally set their sights on was the huge primary school textbook market , which consists of over 300,000 student readers . This , plus the possibility of publishing additional reference materials and teaching aids , adds up to potentially enormous profits . It is the main reason publishers were initally jumping at the chance to get in on the textbook market .  
The main source of purchased ships and naval weaponry has always been the US . But the US , which has a global strategy and huge forces , has designed its ships to specialize in specific missions like air defense or ASW . For the ROC navy , which has far fewer ships and a smaller area of responsibility , highly specialized craft are not necessarily suitable . That is to say , even if Taiwan can procure US ships , it may be necessary to refit or supplement the weaponry .  
The main weaponry for surface warfare at sea is anti-ship missiles , which are superior to traditional shipboard guns in terms of precision , range , and firepower . Currently , all of the ROC 's major warships are equipped with weapons to counter anti-ship missiles .  
Reflecting their age or even leading it , advertisements expand our scope of vision . Metaphysical Punctuality 's " New , New Youth in China " series won the China Times ' top prize for television commercials in 1993 ( left ) . This year , the winner for print media advertising design was Ideology 's " Little Red Riding Hood " series . Its main theme is modern women 's quest for self-fulfillment and physical safety . ( opposite page photo courtesy of Metaphysical Punctuality Company , left photo courtesy of Ideology Company )  
Most may remember how , wherever Chiang went , he was always accompanied by burly individuals in casual dress or suits , with short , neatly groomed hair and stern expressions . These were the men everyone referred to simply as the " Chihais , " and their main mission was to assure the personal safety of the head of state 24 hours a day .  
Chinese have always encouraged those whose marriages are in trouble to stay together . Nevertheless , while divorce is certainly not desirable , it is the main way to bring unfortunate marriages to an end . It is an essential form of protection for both sexes . The problem is , when a marriage hits the rocks , can the male and female players agree to cut the knot as smoothly as they tied it ?  
" The purpose of technology is to serve human cultural development , and the world has already reached a stage in which intangible assets are the most valued and the most valuable , " said Acer Group chairman and CEO Stan Shih at a press conference , adding that the main reason why software is so expensive in Taiwan is because of the small size of the local market .  
The main areas affected by land subsidence run down the western coastal plain from Changhua through Chia-yi , Yunlin and Tainan to Pingtung . Fish farming is prevalent in these counties , and ponds dot the entire area . The excessive pumping of ground water by these fish farmers is so severe that the elevation of towns and village in the area is dropping . This creates problems with drainage leading to frequent flooding .  
This is especially significant in view of the wholesale destruction of traditional buildings in mainland China over recent years . In Taiwan too , tall office buildings and concrete apartment blocks have become the main architectural " vocabulary , " leaving no space for stone lions , and the stone lions at temples are often smeared in gaudy colors , making them unbearably vulgar .  
In the recent enterovirus case , public health scholars were certain that the main channel of transmission of the disease was through fecal and oral transmission . It was rarely transmitted through the air . Thus they instructed people to avoid public places , and to thoroughly wash their hands . Also , swimming pools , kindergartens , nursery schools , and other likely locations for the spread of illness were closed .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
In addition to practically oriented research , Professor Ptak 's main areas of study also include Chinese classical and modern novels , the early history of China 's maritime trade , the history of China 's international relations , and the history of Macao with reference to Sino-Portuguese relations . He gained his doctorate from the University of Heidelberg with a thesis on the Yuan-dynasty dramatist Zheng Tingyu , and his professorship with a monograph on the story of the early-15th-century voyages of the imperial eunuch Zheng He , as portrayed in Ming dynasty drama and novels .  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
In Love in a Small Town , Wang intentionally avoids detailed description of the main characters ' backgrounds or their social milieu . She also keeps narrative comment to a minimum . Instead , the carefully constructed mood of her story conveys the process by which two minor actors-young , spirited and in close physical proximity every day-discover , through force of instinct , their sexuality .  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
Their next main target was 500 core industry firms including listed companies and leading firms in various industries ; in the third phase they expanded their focus further to a total of 5000-plus key companies ( medium and large companies with an annual output value over NT $ 100 million ) .  
" The three main stations are too constrained in their political coverage , " he explains . In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
Some of these dishes are seasonal , while others are staple foods , and quite a few are similar to local Taiwanese snacks . " Back then both Taiwanese and mainlanders were poor , so everyone ate whatever was cheapest ! " says event organizer Tsao Sen . Over a dozen dishes were on display , but on closer inspection , he says , they were all based on just three main ingredients : wheat flour , rice and sweet potatoes .  
The medical community gives two main reasons why there is such wide acceptance of alternative treatments : superstition , and inadequate understanding of cancer treatment . But patients point mostly to the fact that they are tired of suffering .  
MIOD president Robert Chen says that in recent years the RMI has made developing the fishing industry one of the main planks of its economic development strategy , and to foster overseas investment it is encouraging international joint ventures .  
These are some of the main arguments that constitute Lin 's 1988 book China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy , which is now available for the first time in a Taiwan translation in Lin 's recently published The Nuclear Hegemon . Although China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy was published back in 1988 , it is still very enlightening for readers today to find out how Communist China 's nuclear weapons strategy is very much tied to Chinese strategic tradition . Anyone studying Communist China 's military can not ignore the influence of traditional strategic culture .  
In fact , American China policy has maintained a general direction based on three main national interests : democracy and human rights , economics and trade , and security and military strategy . The periodic swinging results from a tug of war between two groups of US domestic forces , one more accomodating toward Beijing such as the mainstream China scholars , the other more critical , such as the media . Nevertheless , Taipei seeks simultaneous improvement of relations with both Washington and Beijing .  
They are the main theme of a series of works by Guatemalan painter Moises Barrios . In one work , a banana graces the cover of a popular magazine . Another painting parodies the work of Piet Mondrian , one of the most famous representatives of rationalism . Mondrian 's canvas with nothing but a single color divided by a few straight lines becomes a banana peel , with a few dark splotches here and there against a yellow background .  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud . But it is no exaggeration to say , as one mainland China cultural maven put it , " Television , film , and pop music are the main channels through which most ordinary people in mainland China have learned about external cultures since the Cultural Revolution . "  
The main characters seem to operate on a higher moral level than most people , because they alone consider it important to make a record of these neglected bronze and stone statues , to enable the public to understand their political and social significance .  
In 1996 , President Lee Teng-hui was far ahead of his rivals all the way , and the election was lopsided . This year , the most prominent feature of the campaign is exactly the opposite : The three main candidates are running neck-and-neck , and the election battle is fierce . It is impossible right now to say who might win , and will probably remain so right up to the finish .  
What about the three main candidates ? Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position . But , in an unguarded moment , Chen also declared " Long live Taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen .  
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties-the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force-all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly . They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  
Lin Neng-jong , director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , who visited the island in March , points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development . Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and-except for fishing products-other materials all have to be imported . Therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms . In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .  
In the center of one of the exhibition rooms , the NPM has laid out a realistic picture of the life of the literati , based on a portrayal in an anonymous Song painting . The main character sits alone in front of a painted screen depicting wild and domestic fowl . To one side , a servant pours tea from a white porcelain pot ; on a table are two or three dishes of fruit and snacks . In front of the scholar stands a basket of classically arranged flowers .  
Huang Cheng-hsiung , executive director of World Vision Taiwan , says that people fell over themselves to take in the orphans created by the earthquake , but the elderly got scant help . The main reason is that children who lost both parents received NT $ 2 million in death benefit , whereas most old people whose children died received no benefit since their children were already married .  
On the day after his inauguration , during a visit to Kinmen , Chen pointed out that under the precondition of ensuring national security , the new government would , based on the laws of the market and the principle of reciprocal and proportional benefit , reexamine the three links . The Executive Yuan is in fact already engaged in an urgent discussion of the three links . Human rights diplomacy In the future , the government plans to make economic relations the main axis of cross-strait policy .  
Perhaps the most interesting part of this temple is to the right of the main hall . The space there contains more than 8000 ancestral tablets for the deceased . This was a space built by the Chinese gold workers and business people of those bygone days as their resting place for the afterlife . It is the largest extant collection of memorial tablets in any overseas Chinese society in Asia .  
Inside the main door is a Guan Gong statue niche decorated with embroidered cloth . In front is an altar for offerings , and votive items are lined up on it . In front of the altar , on a red background using gold thread , is a table-wrap depicting two dragons playing with pearls , two phoenixes flying toward the sun and a hanging embroidered with the words " support righteousness and destroy evil . "  
With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
Except for a small number of sea creatures which are attracting international attention because their numbers are dropping sharply-such as the shark , whale , and sea turtle-few marine animals are protected by law , and it is not difficult for aquariums to collect specimens . Since these then become the main selling points to attract visitors , particular attention is therefore devoted to how these precious creatures respond to their new environment .  
Kinmen 's kaoliang is classified as a " Chinese clear spirit " - one of the world 's three main types of alcoholic beverage . Repeated fermentations and distillations produce a straightforward liquor that possesses a unity of appearance , bouquet and flavor , like a fresh dawn mist . Its taste is sweet and round , and its touch is pleasing to the palate .  
But it also leads to irreversible hyperpigmentation ( extreme darkening of the skin ) . Tsai Yen-ping notes that in fact " meibai does not mean bleaching . It means only to lighten the skin color of the face to the same tone as that of skin on parts of the body less exposed to the sun . " The amount of pigmentation secreted by the basal metrocytes ( base layer cells ) plays the main role in determining a person 's skin color .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
The main points include : mutual respect and mutual love , positive use of language and prohibition of domestic violence , equal contributions to the family by the husband and wife , prohibition of seeing the children as instruments for the realization of the parents ' own ambitions , acceptance of the monogamous marriage system , cultivation of concern and caring in the course of ordinary married life , filial respect for one 's own parents and for the parents of the partner , and cultivation of artistic interests outside of one 's profession .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality . Living on borrowed time and borrowed culture , caught between the ersatz pleasures of the West and the call of historical destiny . . . . "  
There is nothing in the main living area save a large desk covered with black plastic matting , a TV set , and mountainous piles of long sheets of calligraphy paper . But there are other signs as well . On the wall hangs a scroll , reading " Dragon flying , phoenix dancing , " done in a flowing , dynamic hand .  
In the main hall on the first floor stand more than a dozen giant porcelain vases , representing the pottery industry of Yingko . When you climb to the second floor , in Room 201 a worker is stirring cement with all his might in preparation for putting up a decorative wall of cement interspersed with ceramic pieces . And in Room 203 , a group of people are busy putting the finished reproductions on display , documenting the process on video as they go along .  
Moreover , environmental protection work touches on things like community consciousness , the livelihood of farmers and fishermen , and aboriginal culture . Often the main obstacle to environmental protection work is the attitudes of people who live in the mountains and depend on the resources there . Thus environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of a few social elites , but includes economic , social , transportation , and even diplomatic and political aspects .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
The main protagonists : a young , runaway unmarried mother , and her older brother-the director-who films the documentary . How will they deal with the events that upset the ordinary pattern of family life ? How will family members react to these crises ? And how will they overcome their mutual misunderstandings to recreate a harmonious and happy family atmosphere ?  
Seafood in Matsu has an enticing appeal of its own , while also being characteristic Fuzhou cuisine ( one of the eight main branches of Chinese cooking ) in general . The taste is fresh , light and tender , with sweet and sour flavors and an emphasis on soup seasoning .  
Kuanshan Township is located on eastern Taiwan 's main north-south highway . The township is ringed by a 12-kilometer bicycle trail , three to four meters wide , with a concrete surface all the way . The trail is marked off with red bricks , and every 100 meters colored bricks are set in the ground in all kinds of patterns , to remind you that you have advanced another 100 meters !  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
Liu Chia-lang , head of the office of civil affairs , also has strong feelings on the future of development and industry in Tungkang : " Only Japan and Tungkang produce banded coral shrimp , which is one of the main seafood products of the town . And Tapeng Bay abounds in natural resources . Tungkang has what it takes to develop . But Taiwan 's entry into the WTO is going to be a heavy blow to Tungkang 's fishing industry . "  
The main principle agreed upon for cross-strait economic relations amounts to only four words - " proactive opening , effective supervision " - but they have brought new hope to business and confidence to the public . They have even attracted the attention of the international media . This is seen as both a political victory for the Chen administration , and an opportunity for a fresh start in cross-strait relations-a positive development for regional peace .  
Seshui lies on the southwest side of Provincial Highway 21 , close to Tayen Tunnel , with Puli to the north and the famous scenic spot Sun Moon Lake to the south . The neighborhood has an area of something over 60 hectares , and 230-plus inhabitants , who live by farming . Their main crops are vegetables such as aubergines and beans , and high-value cash crops such as betel nuts , orchids and Assam tea .  
Besides medical work , another major contribution of Maxwell 's missionary work was the translation of a vernacular Bible . Since Pingpu indigenous people were the main focus of his missionary work , Maxwell traveled frequently to Aboriginal parishes . There he discovered that contracts for buying and selling of land between Pingpu people and Han Chinese were written using the romanized writing system that was a legacy of the Dutch occupation .  
Born in 1960 , Lan Po-chou grew up in Miaoli County in central Taiwan and graduated with a degree in French literature from Fu Jen Catholic University . Motivated by a deep interest in Taiwanese history , during the late 1980s Lan began to work for Ren Jian Magazine , whose main mission was to bring to light hidden aspects of society . As a writer for this magazine he laid the foundations for his latter fieldwork and investigative reports .  
Putting high hopes on this election , four days before the vote President Chen Shui-bian put forward five main principles for his proposed " National Security Alliance " : to agree on national identity , achieve a breakthrough in cross-strait relations , promote democratic reforms , spark economic development , and eliminate social and political cleavages . He had hoped to achieve a consensus on these points between ruling and opposition parties .  
Shih points out , " Fries , tropical fish , and high-end salt water fish have already become the three main pillars of future aquaculture in Taiwan . " Taiwan 's aquacultural technology is cutting edge . Its foundation in the development of tropical fish strains and the breeding of fries is solid .  
Its design is based on the idea of an eastward-facing traditional Taiwanese sanheyuan farmhouse ( which has a square courtyard that is open on one side and enclosed on three by the main hall and its two wings ) . The school has a simple layout , with its classrooms connected by corridors . Doorways are constructed out of decorative cinderblocks and banisters out of stainless steel molded into plant motifs and matched with wooden railings . Outer walls are decorated with round , square , rectangular and cloud-shaped openings .  
This sinologist from afar believes that his destiny has always been connected to China . Indeed , Joppert , who has always shown an outstanding intellect ever since early youth and has a sharp sixth sense , believes that 900 years ago he was a senior minister in the court of Huizong . The latter two characters of his Chinese name , Li Jiade , are identical with the name of the Song emperor Huizong 's main palace : Jiade Palace . Is that a coincidence , or fate ?  
Once , Wei came to the main island of Taiwan , and saw that people had nailed coins into the heads of chickens and pigs carved out of wood . He had a sudden inspiration to use NT $ 1 coins to produce a genuine " money turtle . " At that time Wei , already an accomplished model boat maker , created with his own hands a vivid and dazzling money turtle out of stacked coins . As you may have guessed , it was an immediate hit , and temples competed to purchase it .  
Though there was a strongly political flavor to Giddens ' visit , commentators reflected that while his ideas are no cure-all for Taiwan , the issues he is concerned about are of direct relevance to Taiwan 's current circumstance . Now the main " homework " to be done in Taiwan is to apply these ideas to open up prior blind spots .  
Natives of Hsiyu living on the main island of Taiwan and elsewhere are now starting to move back , attracted by the outstanding traditional homes , friendly atmosphere , big expanse of azure skies , and pristine blue sea .  
In 1911 they pooled their resources to build a big residence with a main entrance designed in the half-Chinese , half-Western architectural style typical of Southeast Asia , while the interior was designed in the traditional manner of a three-sided residential compound ( san he yuan ) . The building materials used are also noteworthy : a mix of modern materials , such as polished aggregate and decorative tiles , with Penghu 's traditional basalt and coral limestone . These are certainly some of the finest exemplars of traditional homes in all of Penghu .  
The lava pushed up by volcanic activity around the main island of Taiwan was mainly composed of andesite . Molten andesite has a relatively higher content of silicon dioxide , so is more sticky . Thus it more readily forms into conical mountains such as the Tatun volcanic mountains of northern Taiwan . The basalt rocks of Penghu form a stark contrast to the geology of the main island of Taiwan .  
However , after World War I began , Japan began to develop gold and coal mining on a large-scale in Taiwan , for two main reasons . First , Japan at that point had the second-largest naval fleet in the world , requiring huge amounts of coal . In addition , Japan had to import most of its strategic materials , and in those days international trade was still gold-based , requiring gold to purchase products from abroad .  
As visitors , ensconced in a fog of incense smoke , worshipped this seated , silver-faced female deity who protected the people when they first came here to build the town , they were also able to have a detailed look at the main hall , exquisitely sculpted by the early Republican masters Li Huan-mei , Chiang Hsin , and Kuo Hsin-lin , and imagine the exciting scenes of yesteryear when boats filled the harbor and their sails filled the sky .  
The main offerings to Lu 's spirit were the " five treasures of the artisan " ( various measuring devices , markers , and tools ) , while artworks were set on every table as additional offerings . The seriousness with which the ritual was taken is evidenced by the fact that a central government official-Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Liu Wann-hong-served as master of ceremonies , with the Changhua County executive and the mayor of Lukang as his seconds .  
Another international organization based in Taiwan that is devoted to eliminating poverty and hunger is the Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the Asian and Pacific Region ( FFTC ) , which was set up even earlier than the AVDRC . But because FFTC 's main mission is to collect and disseminate information on agricultural technology , it has a smaller staff than the AVDRC and does not have its own experimental farm or research personnel . Hence even fewer people outside the field of agriculture are aware of its existence .  
In Asia , the main reason for inadequate production of staple foods ( most importantly rice ) was backward farming techniques and insufficient fertilizers . Because of this , in 1968 the Asian and Pacific Council ( ASPAC ) , a regional forum of foreign ministers , began to discuss solutions , and decided to set up the FFTC .  
On Marshal Tiandu 's birthday , worshippers lay out a table full of offerings , including cakes , vegetables , and various items that always come in pairs : chicken , goose , fish , and pork tripe . The big spread serves as a show of esteem for the Marshal . On either side of the main offering table are two long , narrow tables laid out with birthday noodles , red eggs , and birthday peaches donated by affiliated temples and individuals .  
Apart from uneven levels of quality , the main reason why alternative medicine is not welcomed by the regulatory authorities or mainstream medical practitioners is that it is difficult or impossible to test the effectiveness of alternative treatments by scientific methods .  
Once rice wine became the main type of cooking wine in kitchens , it became part of virtually every dish and every style of cooking , from wok-frying , deep-fat-frying , and pan-frying to stewing , steaming , and sauteing . Great chefs can not do without rice wine , and this is even more true of eateries specializing in wintertime " tonic foods " like shaojiuji , ginger duck , and mutton hot pot , who literally use it like water to create stews that are at once relaxing and invigorating .  
The purpose of the WHO is defined as helping people in the entire world to enjoy the highest possible standard of health . Its main responsibilities are to offer leadership and coordination on matters related to international health , to provide technical assistance , and to promote measures to prevent epidemics , regional diseases , and other illnesses . In addition , the environment , women 's issues , food safety , and global pharmaceuticals standards also fall within the purview of the WHO .  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
The impression that people are still unable to grasp the meaning of installation art is naturally one of the first addressed by the author . At the very beginning Yao seeks to make clear the purpose and meaning of such art with the following definition : " In general terms installation art refers to an expressive method not a style . In the main it focuses on artistic behavior or approaches undertaken in a physical or conceptual space .  
A new policy of " industrial Taiwan , agricultural Southeast Asia " was crafted , and Japan began to actively promote industrial development in Taiwan with an eye to making the island self-sufficient in the event of war in the Pacific . The Japanese contribution to development can be seen in three areas . In terms of basic industry , the " new city " of Kaohsiung , which the colonial authorities began building in 1904 , became the main base for moving farther into Southeast Asia .  
These instruments are not only the main characters in Indian music and dance but are also a principal medium for honoring the gods and entertaining people . And the erotic paintings that cause people to blush at the museum are not only expressions of human carnal desires . They are even better illustrations of the many-layered Indian religious philosophy , which holds that gods rose out of the common human world .  
At 5 a.m . on June 13 , to the accompaniment of sonorous beiguan music , priests at the temple began to make a report to Heaven about the jiao , explaining the reasons for it and its scheduled itinerary .

The third and fourth generations ( born in the 1940s and 1950s ) are the " post-war baby boomers . " When they were young the country had nothing , and they were confined to small , pragmatic dreams . The main path for the children of working class families was to finish primary school and get a job in a factory . Even for those with higher education , the value of security-the " iron rice bowl " - was paramount , and becoming a civil servant was considered the best guarantee for the future .  
However , kitchen waste is the main source of the foul odors and disease vector proliferation in garbage . When kitchen wastes are mixed with other garbage for processing , landfills are inundated with noxious gases , polluting the air . If taken instead to incinerators , due to their high water content , much energy will be wasted in the burning process , and the lifespan of the incinerator will also be reduced . At the same time , concentrations of the toxin dioxin will be increased .  
At the opening ceremony in Changhua , ROC president and master of ceremonies Chen Shui-bian remarked that the Sun Yat-sen Freeway represented the island 's first transportation revolution . Now the opening of National Highway No . 3 , in conjunction with the 12 high-speed east-west connectors and the main branch of the Western Coastal Expressway construction projects , as well as the high-speed railway ( scheduled to open at the end of 2005 ) , will turn the entire western corridor into a single living area and thus constitute nothing short of a second transportation revolution .  
" Look over there . A magnificent and auspicious blue view has appeared in the heavens . Thus embellished , that row of bare precipices from Yushan 's main summit to its eastern peak at that moment is like a rainbow , reflecting a dazzling auburn light . The creases on the mountain walls gently project a restrained cobalt blue . "  
Its towering presence is beyond the power of words to describe . Additionally , the summit provides a panoramic view of the main sources of water that nourish the land . The Nantsaihsien River and Laonung River are the sources of southern Taiwan 's Kaoping River ; the Chenyoulan River , largest tributary of central Taiwan 's Choshui River , winds its way to the northwest ; and the valley of the Lakulaku River , which feeds eastern Taiwan 's Hsiukuluan River , is also visible in the distance .  
As Japan and Korea take active steps to expand their trade with China , they require many workers who can speak Chinese , which has resulted in a sudden increase in the number of Asian faces , including many Chinese-Americans , coming to Taiwan to study Chinese . Their main reason for choosing Taiwan is that they feel that living and getting around in Taiwan is more convenient . They also feel that Taiwan , as a melting pot of American and Japanese culture , is friendlier to foreigners and that there are fewer chances of culture shock .  
Kray Kee is a small settlement of the Karen minority , located in the northwestern Thai county of Tha Song Yang , nine kilometers from the nearest main road . It used to take three hours to reach on foot , until only a year ago villagers working together finally built a simple road through the mountains , allowing access to four-wheel-drive vehicles . However , during the monsoon season , this unstable mud road becomes much more dangerous to travel along and the only reliable way to reach the village is on foot .  
" Exploration is a scientific endeavor , " he says . Aside from fostering personal courage , the ability to conquer fear , and other valuable characteristics , exploring can refine the skills needed for various outdoor activities and help foster discipline and self-improvement . " As a result , I can pass on the techniques I have learned to even more people . This is the main purpose of exploration , " Chen stresses .  
During the past 60 years , an industry has developed around one type of fish which arrived in Taiwan as smuggled bounty .

The criticism has been advanced that these fishing boats are the illegal mainland immigrants ' main means of support and represent their only capital , so that sending people back without their boat is tantamount to depriving them of their livelihood . Chou Chung-nan counters that most of the fishing boats involved in ferrying illegal mainland immigrants are worn-out and decrepit . Not many of them would be capable of making the voyage home , so there is a practical reason behind the policy of sending whole batches of deportees back on the same boat .  
Currently , the editors at Sinorama have set their three main directions as " the domestic pulse , " " traditional culture , " and " overseas reports , " in order to serve as a link for the aspirations of Chinese home and abroad and to truly become a comprehensive and international publication which " has its footing in Taiwan , is concerned about the mainland , and has its eyes open to the world .

According to Turtles of the World , which was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1989 , excessive culling , along with highway construction in developed countries , is a main reason turtle and tortoise populations are now facing a general crisis . In particular , the trade in turtles as meat and pets is booming as never before . With tortoises and turtles of large and small species alike being adopted as pets or turned into culinary delicacies , there 's no way for these chelonians to fulfill their duty of passing on their genetic legacy .  
The clock tower 's main structure comprised three levels . The upper level bore an armillary sphere , used for astronomical observations ; on the middle level was a celestial globe , which displayed the movements of celestial bodies ; while on the bottom level were wooden mannikins which struck the time of day . The whole formed " a single mechanism , turned by the power of water , without human effort . "  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
The songs of the Ami can be traced back to their fishing , farming , and hunting activities in the mountains and along the coast . In their tightly organized villages , through the annual harvest festival , each successive generation was trained and educated in cultural traditions , which is the main reason these songs have been carried forward .  
This time the main technical challenge was one of climate : Taiwan 's wet , sub-tropical climate differs vastly from the alternately humid and dry , cold and hot climate of southern Australia . But at least it has continual moisture , which does n't do as much damage as punctuated moisture .  
Americans are condemned as ignoramuses living in a country that somehow manages to be both immature and degenerate . Japan is dismissed as a naive child with a fat body and a small brain under American occupation . The British are unfortunately represented by a debauched Oxford graduate whose main occupation seems to be standing up women in Thailand and mainland China .  
Speaking of his 40-year quest to recreate the wooden ox , Wang Jian comments : " I have loved mechanical toys ever since I was a child . When I learned the story of the wooden ox I began making one out of cardboard and wood . I began drawing designs at middle school , and continued thinking on the subject at university , where I read mechanical engineering . My main sources were " Making the Wooden Ox " from Zhuge Liang 's Collected Works , and the documentary records of Zu Chongzhi . "  
My main work at the center has involved taking on psychological counseling cases , and serving as a group leader of empathy and self-affirmation groups , and emotional management groups for single-parent elementary school students . Accompanying people through their low times and sharing life experiences with them is a hard-to-come-by opportunity in this age when people lack ties to others .  
In 1980 , when the North Link Railway was completed , this stretch of track , essential for connecting the east and west coast main lines , became even more important . The single track was turned into a double track , and many of the old single-track tunnels were taken out of service . Now they are objects of our explorations .  
While the rates of adjustment varied , they could be as high as 100% - for example , the fee for " partial liver removal " was raised from NT $ 4000-plus to NT $ 8000-plus . As for complaints by surgeons that they are " low-wage labor , " Parng states that in the future the main focus of adjustments in universal health insurance pay schedules will be on respecting doctors ' special skills .  
Meanwhile , the main regulations governing Taiwan 's relations with Hong Kong have been largely completed . July 1997 will not merely be a starting point for Tung and the people of Hong Kong . Taiwanese , mainland Chinese , overseas Chinese , and Asia-watchers everywhere are waiting with bated breath . Tung is indeed bearing an unprecedented historical burden .  
Chen Chienchun , chief chef for vegetarian dishes , points out that not only do fungi have a fresh and distinct taste , they are very nutritious , and many rare types effectively promote longevity . That 's why he likes to design resplendent main courses using exotic edible fungi : " That 's what it takes to fit the bill at a firstclass hotel , " he says .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down . The main reason was the powerful obstruction of the " male outlook . "  
The idea that one can accumulate merit through charity is part of the traditional Chinese concept that deeds ( good or bad ) will earn their just desserts . Prior to the modern volunteer conception of " finding joy through helping others , " the idea of " gaining merit for the nether world " was long the main motive force to encourage ordinary people to do good .  
Chiang Han-kuang believes that in actuality the main purpose for promoting EQ is to teach everyone to pay attention to emotional and psychological health , to understand individual personalities , to become more mature and stable and to maintain a balance between the body and the mind . The point should be to pursue the true meaning of health and happiness , not such superficial viewpoints as distinguishing EQ grades or gaining advantages .  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
The main reasons for this are that with direct shipping most freight moving between the two sides will no longer need to be transshipped through Hong Kong . Scholars estimate that with direct shipping across the strait , the volume of cargo passing through Hong Kong will shrink by 1 million standard containers . Although this is less than one tenth of Hong Kong 's total volume , it will probably affect Hong Kong 's status as the world 's largest transshipment port .  
Her main hope now is revise the laws to meet the demands of the times , so that executive agencies can be more efficient . Film is another industry " guided " by the GIO . Though not as complex as the broadcast industry , it has its headaches as well , especially the poor economic returns on domestic films .  
Wang Chen-tai notes that early on there were factional conflicts , reducing the religion 's impact . Fortunately , he says , learned elders like Hsieh Sung-tao and Ting Chung-ming wrote inexhaustibly . Also , because of the importance of diplomatic ties with Islamic countries , the ROC government has strongly supported Muslims . The Taipei mosque , which has been the main spiritual and practical resource for Muslims in Taiwan for many years now , was built with government money in response to strong and far-sighted efforts by Ambassador Yeh Kung-chao .  
Opposite the main entrance , the spacious farmhouse boasts a wallful of award certificates and wooden plaques from friends : 1985 Taoyuan County Top Ten Farmers ; First Place , 1994 Organic Growers ' Exhibition ; 1995 Farm Entrepreneur of the Year . Just this year , Chuang was honored with Taiwan 's highest agricultural award , the " Shen Nong " award for his " leadership role in research and promotion of organic farming methods and production of safe , high-quality vegetables . "  
The main culprits causing newspaper publishers to feel panicky are familiar : the rising price of paper worldwide ; economic downturns ; and constantly improving electronic technology , so that newspapers find it harder and harder to be as timely as TV or radio .  
To fulfill an election promise to eliminate garbage from Taoyuan 's cities , County Executive Annette Lu has , first of all , applied to the EPA to build two inter-area incinerators which would be operational in four years . Secondly , she has asked 13 cities , townships and rural townships to build small-scale sanitary landfills , and permitted and aided towns in establishing small-scale incinerators and local dumps , which can serve as stop-gap measures before the main incinerators are built .  
The first book he ever bought himself was Stories from Chinese History . Later , when he studied at Chienkuo Boys High School , his happiest moments were browsing the second-hand book stores on Kuling Street with his classmates . This was a very popular place for literary youth of the 1960s and 70s to go . Reading books outside the main curriculum gave many people a rebellious or independent cast of mind , and cultivated many of today 's leading intellectuals and social elites .  
It is said that his main contribution was to cut down the large trees that shaded the grand avenues for the nouveaux riches , level the dwellings that had stood between them , smooth off the hill tops to make them into gentle slopes , and turn the rectangular lakes and canals into irregular expanses of water and small streams . Then he would make a snaking path on the expanse of grass and let loose a flock of sheep of just the right number .  
The Assembly session sparked contention throughout society : It touched on major issues of the power of the president and premier , and of the existence of the provincial government . There were divisions of opinion among and within the three main political parties . Scholars engaged in heated debate , and citizens took to the streets .  
What private sector publishing firms originally set their sights on was the huge primary school textbook market , which consists of over 300,000 student readers . This , plus the possibility of publishing additional reference materials and teaching aids , adds up to potentially enormous profits . It is the main reason publishers were initally jumping at the chance to get in on the textbook market .  
The main source of purchased ships and naval weaponry has always been the US . But the US , which has a global strategy and huge forces , has designed its ships to specialize in specific missions like air defense or ASW . For the ROC navy , which has far fewer ships and a smaller area of responsibility , highly specialized craft are not necessarily suitable . That is to say , even if Taiwan can procure US ships , it may be necessary to refit or supplement the weaponry .  
The main weaponry for surface warfare at sea is anti-ship missiles , which are superior to traditional shipboard guns in terms of precision , range , and firepower . Currently , all of the ROC 's major warships are equipped with weapons to counter anti-ship missiles .  
Reflecting their age or even leading it , advertisements expand our scope of vision . Metaphysical Punctuality 's " New , New Youth in China " series won the China Times ' top prize for television commercials in 1993 ( left ) . This year , the winner for print media advertising design was Ideology 's " Little Red Riding Hood " series . Its main theme is modern women 's quest for self-fulfillment and physical safety . ( opposite page photo courtesy of Metaphysical Punctuality Company , left photo courtesy of Ideology Company )  
Most may remember how , wherever Chiang went , he was always accompanied by burly individuals in casual dress or suits , with short , neatly groomed hair and stern expressions . These were the men everyone referred to simply as the " Chihais , " and their main mission was to assure the personal safety of the head of state 24 hours a day .  
Chinese have always encouraged those whose marriages are in trouble to stay together . Nevertheless , while divorce is certainly not desirable , it is the main way to bring unfortunate marriages to an end . It is an essential form of protection for both sexes . The problem is , when a marriage hits the rocks , can the male and female players agree to cut the knot as smoothly as they tied it ?  
" The purpose of technology is to serve human cultural development , and the world has already reached a stage in which intangible assets are the most valued and the most valuable , " said Acer Group chairman and CEO Stan Shih at a press conference , adding that the main reason why software is so expensive in Taiwan is because of the small size of the local market .  
The main areas affected by land subsidence run down the western coastal plain from Changhua through Chia-yi , Yunlin and Tainan to Pingtung . Fish farming is prevalent in these counties , and ponds dot the entire area . The excessive pumping of ground water by these fish farmers is so severe that the elevation of towns and village in the area is dropping . This creates problems with drainage leading to frequent flooding .  
This is especially significant in view of the wholesale destruction of traditional buildings in mainland China over recent years . In Taiwan too , tall office buildings and concrete apartment blocks have become the main architectural " vocabulary , " leaving no space for stone lions , and the stone lions at temples are often smeared in gaudy colors , making them unbearably vulgar .  
In the recent enterovirus case , public health scholars were certain that the main channel of transmission of the disease was through fecal and oral transmission . It was rarely transmitted through the air . Thus they instructed people to avoid public places , and to thoroughly wash their hands . Also , swimming pools , kindergartens , nursery schools , and other likely locations for the spread of illness were closed .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
In addition to practically oriented research , Professor Ptak 's main areas of study also include Chinese classical and modern novels , the early history of China 's maritime trade , the history of China 's international relations , and the history of Macao with reference to Sino-Portuguese relations . He gained his doctorate from the University of Heidelberg with a thesis on the Yuan-dynasty dramatist Zheng Tingyu , and his professorship with a monograph on the story of the early-15th-century voyages of the imperial eunuch Zheng He , as portrayed in Ming dynasty drama and novels .  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
In Love in a Small Town , Wang intentionally avoids detailed description of the main characters ' backgrounds or their social milieu . She also keeps narrative comment to a minimum . Instead , the carefully constructed mood of her story conveys the process by which two minor actors-young , spirited and in close physical proximity every day-discover , through force of instinct , their sexuality .  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
Their next main target was 500 core industry firms including listed companies and leading firms in various industries ; in the third phase they expanded their focus further to a total of 5000-plus key companies ( medium and large companies with an annual output value over NT $ 100 million ) .  
" The three main stations are too constrained in their political coverage , " he explains . In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
Some of these dishes are seasonal , while others are staple foods , and quite a few are similar to local Taiwanese snacks . " Back then both Taiwanese and mainlanders were poor , so everyone ate whatever was cheapest ! " says event organizer Tsao Sen . Over a dozen dishes were on display , but on closer inspection , he says , they were all based on just three main ingredients : wheat flour , rice and sweet potatoes .  
The medical community gives two main reasons why there is such wide acceptance of alternative treatments : superstition , and inadequate understanding of cancer treatment . But patients point mostly to the fact that they are tired of suffering .  
MIOD president Robert Chen says that in recent years the RMI has made developing the fishing industry one of the main planks of its economic development strategy , and to foster overseas investment it is encouraging international joint ventures .  
These are some of the main arguments that constitute Lin 's 1988 book China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy , which is now available for the first time in a Taiwan translation in Lin 's recently published The Nuclear Hegemon . Although China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy was published back in 1988 , it is still very enlightening for readers today to find out how Communist China 's nuclear weapons strategy is very much tied to Chinese strategic tradition . Anyone studying Communist China 's military can not ignore the influence of traditional strategic culture .  
In fact , American China policy has maintained a general direction based on three main national interests : democracy and human rights , economics and trade , and security and military strategy . The periodic swinging results from a tug of war between two groups of US domestic forces , one more accomodating toward Beijing such as the mainstream China scholars , the other more critical , such as the media . Nevertheless , Taipei seeks simultaneous improvement of relations with both Washington and Beijing .  
They are the main theme of a series of works by Guatemalan painter Moises Barrios . In one work , a banana graces the cover of a popular magazine . Another painting parodies the work of Piet Mondrian , one of the most famous representatives of rationalism . Mondrian 's canvas with nothing but a single color divided by a few straight lines becomes a banana peel , with a few dark splotches here and there against a yellow background .  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud . But it is no exaggeration to say , as one mainland China cultural maven put it , " Television , film , and pop music are the main channels through which most ordinary people in mainland China have learned about external cultures since the Cultural Revolution . "  
The main characters seem to operate on a higher moral level than most people , because they alone consider it important to make a record of these neglected bronze and stone statues , to enable the public to understand their political and social significance .  
In 1996 , President Lee Teng-hui was far ahead of his rivals all the way , and the election was lopsided . This year , the most prominent feature of the campaign is exactly the opposite : The three main candidates are running neck-and-neck , and the election battle is fierce . It is impossible right now to say who might win , and will probably remain so right up to the finish .  
What about the three main candidates ? Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position . But , in an unguarded moment , Chen also declared " Long live Taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen .  
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties-the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force-all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly . They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  
Lin Neng-jong , director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , who visited the island in March , points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development . Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and-except for fishing products-other materials all have to be imported . Therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms . In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .  
In the center of one of the exhibition rooms , the NPM has laid out a realistic picture of the life of the literati , based on a portrayal in an anonymous Song painting . The main character sits alone in front of a painted screen depicting wild and domestic fowl . To one side , a servant pours tea from a white porcelain pot ; on a table are two or three dishes of fruit and snacks . In front of the scholar stands a basket of classically arranged flowers .  
Huang Cheng-hsiung , executive director of World Vision Taiwan , says that people fell over themselves to take in the orphans created by the earthquake , but the elderly got scant help . The main reason is that children who lost both parents received NT $ 2 million in death benefit , whereas most old people whose children died received no benefit since their children were already married .  
On the day after his inauguration , during a visit to Kinmen , Chen pointed out that under the precondition of ensuring national security , the new government would , based on the laws of the market and the principle of reciprocal and proportional benefit , reexamine the three links . The Executive Yuan is in fact already engaged in an urgent discussion of the three links . Human rights diplomacy In the future , the government plans to make economic relations the main axis of cross-strait policy .  
Perhaps the most interesting part of this temple is to the right of the main hall . The space there contains more than 8000 ancestral tablets for the deceased . This was a space built by the Chinese gold workers and business people of those bygone days as their resting place for the afterlife . It is the largest extant collection of memorial tablets in any overseas Chinese society in Asia .  
Inside the main door is a Guan Gong statue niche decorated with embroidered cloth . In front is an altar for offerings , and votive items are lined up on it . In front of the altar , on a red background using gold thread , is a table-wrap depicting two dragons playing with pearls , two phoenixes flying toward the sun and a hanging embroidered with the words " support righteousness and destroy evil . "  
With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
Except for a small number of sea creatures which are attracting international attention because their numbers are dropping sharply-such as the shark , whale , and sea turtle-few marine animals are protected by law , and it is not difficult for aquariums to collect specimens . Since these then become the main selling points to attract visitors , particular attention is therefore devoted to how these precious creatures respond to their new environment .  
Kinmen 's kaoliang is classified as a " Chinese clear spirit " - one of the world 's three main types of alcoholic beverage . Repeated fermentations and distillations produce a straightforward liquor that possesses a unity of appearance , bouquet and flavor , like a fresh dawn mist . Its taste is sweet and round , and its touch is pleasing to the palate .  
But it also leads to irreversible hyperpigmentation ( extreme darkening of the skin ) . Tsai Yen-ping notes that in fact " meibai does not mean bleaching . It means only to lighten the skin color of the face to the same tone as that of skin on parts of the body less exposed to the sun . " The amount of pigmentation secreted by the basal metrocytes ( base layer cells ) plays the main role in determining a person 's skin color .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
The main points include : mutual respect and mutual love , positive use of language and prohibition of domestic violence , equal contributions to the family by the husband and wife , prohibition of seeing the children as instruments for the realization of the parents ' own ambitions , acceptance of the monogamous marriage system , cultivation of concern and caring in the course of ordinary married life , filial respect for one 's own parents and for the parents of the partner , and cultivation of artistic interests outside of one 's profession .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality . Living on borrowed time and borrowed culture , caught between the ersatz pleasures of the West and the call of historical destiny . . . . "  
There is nothing in the main living area save a large desk covered with black plastic matting , a TV set , and mountainous piles of long sheets of calligraphy paper . But there are other signs as well . On the wall hangs a scroll , reading " Dragon flying , phoenix dancing , " done in a flowing , dynamic hand .  
In the main hall on the first floor stand more than a dozen giant porcelain vases , representing the pottery industry of Yingko . When you climb to the second floor , in Room 201 a worker is stirring cement with all his might in preparation for putting up a decorative wall of cement interspersed with ceramic pieces . And in Room 203 , a group of people are busy putting the finished reproductions on display , documenting the process on video as they go along .  
Moreover , environmental protection work touches on things like community consciousness , the livelihood of farmers and fishermen , and aboriginal culture . Often the main obstacle to environmental protection work is the attitudes of people who live in the mountains and depend on the resources there . Thus environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of a few social elites , but includes economic , social , transportation , and even diplomatic and political aspects .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
The main protagonists : a young , runaway unmarried mother , and her older brother-the director-who films the documentary . How will they deal with the events that upset the ordinary pattern of family life ? How will family members react to these crises ? And how will they overcome their mutual misunderstandings to recreate a harmonious and happy family atmosphere ?  
Seafood in Matsu has an enticing appeal of its own , while also being characteristic Fuzhou cuisine ( one of the eight main branches of Chinese cooking ) in general . The taste is fresh , light and tender , with sweet and sour flavors and an emphasis on soup seasoning .  
Kuanshan Township is located on eastern Taiwan 's main north-south highway . The township is ringed by a 12-kilometer bicycle trail , three to four meters wide , with a concrete surface all the way . The trail is marked off with red bricks , and every 100 meters colored bricks are set in the ground in all kinds of patterns , to remind you that you have advanced another 100 meters !  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
Liu Chia-lang , head of the office of civil affairs , also has strong feelings on the future of development and industry in Tungkang : " Only Japan and Tungkang produce banded coral shrimp , which is one of the main seafood products of the town . And Tapeng Bay abounds in natural resources . Tungkang has what it takes to develop . But Taiwan 's entry into the WTO is going to be a heavy blow to Tungkang 's fishing industry . "  
The main principle agreed upon for cross-strait economic relations amounts to only four words - " proactive opening , effective supervision " - but they have brought new hope to business and confidence to the public . They have even attracted the attention of the international media . This is seen as both a political victory for the Chen administration , and an opportunity for a fresh start in cross-strait relations-a positive development for regional peace .  
Seshui lies on the southwest side of Provincial Highway 21 , close to Tayen Tunnel , with Puli to the north and the famous scenic spot Sun Moon Lake to the south . The neighborhood has an area of something over 60 hectares , and 230-plus inhabitants , who live by farming . Their main crops are vegetables such as aubergines and beans , and high-value cash crops such as betel nuts , orchids and Assam tea .  
Besides medical work , another major contribution of Maxwell 's missionary work was the translation of a vernacular Bible . Since Pingpu indigenous people were the main focus of his missionary work , Maxwell traveled frequently to Aboriginal parishes . There he discovered that contracts for buying and selling of land between Pingpu people and Han Chinese were written using the romanized writing system that was a legacy of the Dutch occupation .  
Born in 1960 , Lan Po-chou grew up in Miaoli County in central Taiwan and graduated with a degree in French literature from Fu Jen Catholic University . Motivated by a deep interest in Taiwanese history , during the late 1980s Lan began to work for Ren Jian Magazine , whose main mission was to bring to light hidden aspects of society . As a writer for this magazine he laid the foundations for his latter fieldwork and investigative reports .  
Putting high hopes on this election , four days before the vote President Chen Shui-bian put forward five main principles for his proposed " National Security Alliance " : to agree on national identity , achieve a breakthrough in cross-strait relations , promote democratic reforms , spark economic development , and eliminate social and political cleavages . He had hoped to achieve a consensus on these points between ruling and opposition parties .  
Shih points out , " Fries , tropical fish , and high-end salt water fish have already become the three main pillars of future aquaculture in Taiwan . " Taiwan 's aquacultural technology is cutting edge . Its foundation in the development of tropical fish strains and the breeding of fries is solid .  
Its design is based on the idea of an eastward-facing traditional Taiwanese sanheyuan farmhouse ( which has a square courtyard that is open on one side and enclosed on three by the main hall and its two wings ) . The school has a simple layout , with its classrooms connected by corridors . Doorways are constructed out of decorative cinderblocks and banisters out of stainless steel molded into plant motifs and matched with wooden railings . Outer walls are decorated with round , square , rectangular and cloud-shaped openings .  
This sinologist from afar believes that his destiny has always been connected to China . Indeed , Joppert , who has always shown an outstanding intellect ever since early youth and has a sharp sixth sense , believes that 900 years ago he was a senior minister in the court of Huizong . The latter two characters of his Chinese name , Li Jiade , are identical with the name of the Song emperor Huizong 's main palace : Jiade Palace . Is that a coincidence , or fate ?  
Once , Wei came to the main island of Taiwan , and saw that people had nailed coins into the heads of chickens and pigs carved out of wood . He had a sudden inspiration to use NT $ 1 coins to produce a genuine " money turtle . " At that time Wei , already an accomplished model boat maker , created with his own hands a vivid and dazzling money turtle out of stacked coins . As you may have guessed , it was an immediate hit , and temples competed to purchase it .  
Though there was a strongly political flavor to Giddens ' visit , commentators reflected that while his ideas are no cure-all for Taiwan , the issues he is concerned about are of direct relevance to Taiwan 's current circumstance . Now the main " homework " to be done in Taiwan is to apply these ideas to open up prior blind spots .  
Natives of Hsiyu living on the main island of Taiwan and elsewhere are now starting to move back , attracted by the outstanding traditional homes , friendly atmosphere , big expanse of azure skies , and pristine blue sea .  
In 1911 they pooled their resources to build a big residence with a main entrance designed in the half-Chinese , half-Western architectural style typical of Southeast Asia , while the interior was designed in the traditional manner of a three-sided residential compound ( san he yuan ) . The building materials used are also noteworthy : a mix of modern materials , such as polished aggregate and decorative tiles , with Penghu 's traditional basalt and coral limestone . These are certainly some of the finest exemplars of traditional homes in all of Penghu .  
The lava pushed up by volcanic activity around the main island of Taiwan was mainly composed of andesite . Molten andesite has a relatively higher content of silicon dioxide , so is more sticky . Thus it more readily forms into conical mountains such as the Tatun volcanic mountains of northern Taiwan . The basalt rocks of Penghu form a stark contrast to the geology of the main island of Taiwan .  
However , after World War I began , Japan began to develop gold and coal mining on a large-scale in Taiwan , for two main reasons . First , Japan at that point had the second-largest naval fleet in the world , requiring huge amounts of coal . In addition , Japan had to import most of its strategic materials , and in those days international trade was still gold-based , requiring gold to purchase products from abroad .  
As visitors , ensconced in a fog of incense smoke , worshipped this seated , silver-faced female deity who protected the people when they first came here to build the town , they were also able to have a detailed look at the main hall , exquisitely sculpted by the early Republican masters Li Huan-mei , Chiang Hsin , and Kuo Hsin-lin , and imagine the exciting scenes of yesteryear when boats filled the harbor and their sails filled the sky .  
The main offerings to Lu 's spirit were the " five treasures of the artisan " ( various measuring devices , markers , and tools ) , while artworks were set on every table as additional offerings .

Another international organization based in Taiwan that is devoted to eliminating poverty and hunger is the Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the Asian and Pacific Region ( FFTC ) , which was set up even earlier than the AVDRC . But because FFTC 's main mission is to collect and disseminate information on agricultural technology , it has a smaller staff than the AVDRC and does not have its own experimental farm or research personnel . Hence even fewer people outside the field of agriculture are aware of its existence .  
In Asia , the main reason for inadequate production of staple foods ( most importantly rice ) was backward farming techniques and insufficient fertilizers .

These instruments are not only the main characters in Indian music and dance but are also a principal medium for honoring the gods and entertaining people .

Even for those with higher education , the value of security-the " iron rice bowl " - was paramount , and becoming a civil servant was considered the best guarantee for the future .  
However , kitchen waste is the main source of the foul odors and disease vector proliferation in garbage . When kitchen wastes are mixed with other garbage for processing , landfills are inundated with noxious gases , polluting the air .

The creases on the mountain walls gently project a restrained cobalt blue . "  
Its towering presence is beyond the power of words to describe . Additionally , the summit provides a panoramic view of the main sources of water that nourish the land .

They also feel that Taiwan , as a melting pot of American and Japanese culture , is friendlier to foreigners and that there are fewer chances of culture shock .  
Kray Kee is a small settlement of the Karen minority , located in the northwestern Thai county of Tha Song Yang , nine kilometers from the nearest main road . It used to take three hours to reach on foot , until only a year ago villagers working together finally built a simple road through the mountains , allowing access to four-wheel-drive vehicles .
