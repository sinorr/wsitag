Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . .

Regarding governmental affairs , Premier lien has actively promoted setting out a legal structure for local autonomy . For foreign relations , he has worked toward opening up bilateral and multilateral relations .

He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
On the contrary , installation is very volatile and highly inviting of the audience 's active participation . Plus it is very hard to preserve , and thus it is inherently anti-market and by nature given to protest . He selected the form since it suits his sarcastic and critical works of art .  
But Chinese herbal pharmacists distinguish between this drained gall and the gall taken from wild bears , which they call " true gall . " Drained gall , they say , lacks three active medicinal ingredients , and they have indeed shown that it is not as effective as true gall .

One scientific theory is that in this state the right hemisphere of the brain , which controls imagination , memory , creativity , and sensibility , is active , whereas the left hemisphere of the brain , which controls analytical thought , value judgments , and logical thinking , is suppressed .

Our ancient ancestors knew only too well how active and vital love can be at its most primitive , so it is hardly surprising if they regarded it as a raging flood or wild beast , and tried to " preserve Heaven 's order by eliminating human desire . "  
However , as in the example of author Lin Ching-hsuen , people are often wrongly categorized based on these test results , and more and more doubts are being cast on this type of testing . This has been particularly true in recent years with Taiwan 's active promotion of special gifted and talented programs . Because such a large proportion of gifted students are chosen based on IQ tests , the question of the practicality and fairness of such measures has stirred up a great deal of controversy .  
It was n't that I had no interest in reading it , but rather was unable to get away from the constant stream of daily activities that keep me busy . Then , however , when I finally struggled through to the second chapter , I read about the idea of " active laziness .

Architecture scholar Wang Chen-hwa says that there are three kinds of historic building restoration : The first is untouched preservation , leaving a building how it is without touching a thing . Secondly , when a building has urban historical significance , there is restored preservation . Thirdly , if the building is still connected to people 's lives and is usable , a preservation method that involves active utilization of the building can be adopted . " Historic buildings are living and changing all the time , " he says .  
Speaking of the focus of future foreign relations , he says that they will first be directed at countries with whom Taiwan has formal ties .

" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
It is precisely this use of synergistic combinations of natural substances-both from animals and plants-as opposed to the use of individually active chemical substances , " says Chang , who holds a doctorate in chemistry and is certified as a doctor of Chinese medicine .

It is activated when a doctor anywhere in Taiwan comes across any disease which , according to law , must be reported ; the doctor then files a report with the local bureau of public health . The latter network involves cooperation among public health agencies and about 800 doctors nationwide . Each week a telephone survey is done of the situation in various areas , so that there is constant active monitoring of overall public health conditions .  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .

Assistance also comes from locals who have long been active in the labor and human rights movements , such as Yvonne Lin , who for nearly ten years has helped foreign laborers stuck in detention centers to get back to their home countries . Lin says that caring for the lives of working people is a cause that transcends nationality , and that disputes between overseas workers and their employers often simply highlight problems already faced by Taiwanese workers . Tackling such problems can help to pave the way for improved rights all round .  
Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs . It 's not just anyone who is cut out for this pursuit , for frogs are especially active at night , when most people are in dreamland . He explores dark forests , deep valleys , and remote watercourses , searching for the 31 species of frogs and toads in Taiwan . He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
They often pop up in rice paddies , and the toad-which because of the keratinization of its skin is at home away from the water-is also a frequent visitor to inhabited areas . But other species are confined to specific areas or are only active in particular seasons . So unless you traipse across countless rivers and endless mountains , you are n't likely to ever see them in their natural state .

Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market .

While SARS was prevalent , the increase in stress and the resultant weakening of immune functions enabled TB to spread and develop into active cases easily . Victims who were afraid to go to hospitals to obtain medicine or who had no one to supervise the taking of medication may also have caused increases in the number the failed treatments and the incidence of drug-resistant bacterial strains . However , SARS did at least have one salutary effect-it called the medical profession 's attention to tuberculosis .  
However , when a person is infected by the TB bacillus , he will not usually immediately develop full-blown tuberculosis , and the bacterium may remain latent inside the body for a long period of time . Generally speaking , once infected , there is a roughly 10% chance of a person developing an active case during the rest of his life . Of those who do develop TB , half do so within five years of infection .

Today 's world dialectically combines within itself both dangers and threats fraught with instability and the risk of new global shocks , while nourishing the growth of an essentially new and different non-confrontational system of international relations .  Through ever more active multilateral efforts in confronting common challenges , we see more clearly the basic principles of such a system .  
At that time , the United Nations will have to play an active and decisive role so as to maintain the social , economic and political balance among the nations that make it up , with the understanding that all have the same rights and obligations now that we are enjoying a relative peace and that titanic efforts are under way to resolve the conflicts that persist .
