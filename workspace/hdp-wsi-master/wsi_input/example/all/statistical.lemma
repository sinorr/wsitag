The Commission also established the Expert Group on the Statistical Implications of Recent Major United Nations Conferences to draw up a work programme reflecting the major action areas identified by the Summit and indicators where international statistical work in the social field should be concentrated .  
The integrity of the statistical institution ( i.e . , whether it operated under a published statistical law and independently of political interference ) , the transparency of the statistical production and dissemination process , and public and equal access to information were three important concerns for winning the trust of users in official economic statistics .  
The Expert Group recognized the need to create forums in which national statistical agency experts could address technical issues , and emphasized that informal ad hoc groups comprised of representatives of a small number of countries , constituted along the lines of the Voorburg Group on Service Statistics , could play an effective role in addressing such technical issues due to their greater flexibility compared to intersecretariat groups .  12 .  For each issue identified , the Expert Group reviewed ongoing research and existing coordination processes at the international level .  
Although some participants stressed the need to respond in a flexible manner to the demand for economic information for decision-making , including forecasting , others raised the potential conflict of interest in national statistical offices , first making projections and then publishing official statistics that either corroborated or invalidated their own projections .

The first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Vancouver , Canada , 1976 ) was supported by producing a statistical annex , h a set of derived measures combined with raw data , used for supporting the major findings and recommendations of the Conference .  
There is a pressing need for a substantial increase in the level of funding and its effective use to coordinate coherent and sustainable approaches to statistical capacitybuilding .  
For statistical capacity to be treated as a priority by national Governments and international agencies , the awareness of the importance of timely and relevant statistics for policy , management , monitoring and democratic accountability needs to be raised .  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) timely , reliable and relevant national statistics on economic and social areas will be made available , especially gender-sensitive statistics ; and ( b ) member States are fully committed to further enhancing the capacity of statistical staff on various statistical issues and packages presented by ESCWA , and to this end their full participation in training workshops conducted by ESCWA will be instrumental .  
However , the fact that only nine responses indicated that their authors used the instrument developed by the Centre renders those responses of limited value for analytical , comparative or statistical purposes , or for the purpose of establishing a consolidated database for coordination of and information on international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Urge States to establish , on the basis of existing statistical information , national programmes , including affirmative action measures , to promote the access of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities to education , medical care and basic social services ;  
It also decided to limit requests for written information to statistical data ; information requested in the Committees reporting guidelines , but missing from the report ; points of clarification regarding the report ; and information on key legal , structural , policy or institutional issues or new developments .  
In future , it will limit requests for written information to statistical data , information requested in the guidelines but missing in the report points of clarification regarding the report , and information on key legal , structural , policy and institutional issues ( for the initial report ) or new developments ( with regard to periodic reports ) .  
However , it was also recognized that , apart from that statistical definition , the meaning of the term youth varied in different societies around the world and that definitions of youth had changed continuously in response to fluctuating political , economic and socio-cultural circumstances .  
Several challenges which faced the implementation of commitments and for monitoring included : the need to reverse the declining trend in the levels of external resources , including the need for a substantial increase in the UNCTAD LDCs Trust Fund ; and the need to improve the measurement tools through the strengthening of national statistical systems to generate and manage relevant data in LDCs , as recognized in the Programme of Action .  
States are invited to compile and publish statistical data broken down by racial and ethnic groups in the areas of health , system of criminal justice , housing , education and employment , with a view to determining whether policies or programmes are having a disproportionate impact on such groups , and to take supplementary measures , when drawing up and evaluating individual policies and programmes , in order to remedy such impact ;  
The meeting noted ( a ) the importance of adopting poverty monitoring plans agreed by all stakeholders , with external assistance to promote the dialogue ; ( b ) the need for strategic statistical plans to be jointly developed by all stakeholders , including planners , civil society , donors and the international community ; and ( c ) that the generation of community-level statistics was facilitated through cost-sharing , for example , when local authorities funded the field costs of surveys in their locality .  
A second stakeholder issue is that although the statistical indicators that are derived from United Nations conferences and summits are motivated by international needs , they are based on policy issues that must be reflected in the national policy agenda if the desired progress is to be achieved . 
That measure could be based on the level of regular statistical activity within a country , an ongoing critical mass of survey-taking and statistical analysis , and the existence of basic elements of statistical infrastructure .  
One concern is that that initiative and the resulting indicator should not be dominated by economic statistics but should span the wide range of statistical areas covered by national statistical systems and the indicators considered in the present report .  
However , as statistical capacity develops the technical standards that one may apply to any indicator may be increased : definitions may be refined and the quality of the indicator at a global level improved .  
Organization of two regional training workshops for experts of national statistical offices and other public institutes responsible for official statistics , one on the production , standardization and dissemination of social statistics , social indicators and the analysis of the social situation ; and the other on the production , standardization and dissemination of environmental statistics and indicators and the analysis of the state of environment in the region ;

At the same time , one must also consider the increasingly growing trend of increasingly close international economic interaction and international investment , service trade , etc . , improve and perfect trade statistical methods , make statistical data objective and realistic , create good conditions for mutually beneficial co-operation among various countries of the world and healthy development of world economic trade .  
This is because the compilation and publication that comes out of the ISI 's citation indexing database is aimed at providing services for scientific and technical information , and the items cited do not all directly affect the concrete substance of articles ; so as a type of statistical analysis product , the influence itself of the data does not have an academic evaluative content and should not be deemed the authoritative data for evaluating academic publications .  
Third , we must make preparations ahead of time , guarding against and dispelling in a timely manner the risk of imbalances in our international balance of payments which may result from bringing in foreign capital improperly , and we should also enhance our oversight and advance warning regarding foreign capital flow , strengthening our statistical analysis of the international balance of payments .  
The local planning , finance , agricultural , supervision , audit , grain , statistical , and quality and technological supervision departments and branches of the Agricultural Development Bank and branches of the Central Grain Reserve Company and other departments and units must take a step further to strengthen cooperation and coordination , give full play to their respective functions and roles , and work hard to make sure that proper personnel are assigned , that the work is done , and that the responsibilities are fulfilled .  
Liu Fuyuan pointed out : To perfect China 's macroeconomic monitoring system , it is necessary to set up a whole set of statistical systems aligned with international standards , fully use advanced networking technologies , and further enhance the level of data processing .  
As for why I should attach such great importance to the water shortage , I might as well list a series of statistical figures : Per capita water resources in China as a whole currently stand at less than 300 cubic meters , one eighth of the national average or one thirtieth of the world 's average , and much lower than the internationally recognized minimum water standard of 1,000 cubic meters each person .

But in previous years when public health insurance was principally administered under labor insurance , limitations in terms of equipment , manpower , and even information about the total number of monthly registered cases in all the clinics and hospitals , made it completely unattainable . Computerized statistical analysis and cross-referencing of the vast amounts of information was even farther outside the realm of possibility .  
Because the open style of our questions elicited a wide variety of opinions , expressed in an even greater variety of ways , for ease of statistical presentation we have combined the answers into various broad categories such as positive , negative or neutral , while reflecting the more detailed content in narrative form .  
The best base line for statistical comparisons is 1990 , when the drug problem in Taiwan became apparent for the first time after amphetamines were made controlled substances and amphetamine use began to be included in narcotics crime statistics . Beginning in that year , figures for cases , arrests , and confiscations rose steadily , peaking in 1993 . Thereafter there was a rapid decline , creating a dramatic " U-turn " in the situation ( see chart ) .  
However , because these organizations are all run by private individuals or civic groups , and are constantly being changed in response to social problems , to date no complete statistical survey has been done which would accurately reflect the actual resources which can be provided by Taiwan 's halfway houses .  
Some even say that light is emitted . In addition , in observing the statistical data , Chen also noted that the electrical currents and electromagnetic waves both have very regular directional characteristics .

To be efficient , public expenditure planning needs a coherent macroeconomic framework in which the institutional capability is shared between the ministries of finance and planning , the central bank and the statistical office .  
Bearing in mind that official statistical information is an essential basis for sustainable development in the economic , demographic , social and environmental fields and for mutual knowledge and trade among the States and peoples of the world ,  
While the initial methodological work involved should be carried out at the international level , it could be envisaged that experimental applications and statistical data collection and analysis be subsequently undertaken in a regional context .

Improving the reliability , utility and public availability of statistical and other information material on social development , including on gender issues , at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Workshops noted that the dissemination of census results had been weak and that national statistical offices had failed to give the issue sufficient attention , had not been adequate in terms of their awareness of users ' requirements , or had continued to use only traditional methods in situations where newer technology could have been effective .  
Under meetings , seminars and workshops , most member organizations have specific plans and dates for training courses on national accounts concepts and practices and other specialized statistical systems linked with the SNA , such as balance of payments , government finance , and monetary and financial statistics , as well as interregional and regional workshops and seminars on practical implementation of the 1993 SNA .  
In August 1993 , IMF wrote to ministers of finance , central bank governors and heads of national statistical offices in a number of industrial and developing countries to seek their comments on the terms of reference of the Task Force ; on the role of international organizations in developing standards for finance statistics ; on current arrangements for data collection and sharing ; and on the findings of the questionnaire .  
None the less , some of the objectives of the Task Force are being addressed by the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics , which was established in 1992 with a membership of international and national statistical agencies to implement the recommendations contained in two IMF reports : " Report on the measurement of international capital flows " and " Report on the world current account discrepancy " .

William Seltzer , former Director of the Statistical Division , delivered a commemorative address covering some of the primary issues considered in establishing the Statistical Commission in 1946 , the range of issues that the Commission has addressed over the years , and patterns that have emerged in the work of the Commission and of the international statistical organizations over the past 50 years , including patterns in substance , regional focus and principal matters of concern .  
In the developing countries , conceptual and methodological constraints and conventional labour force definitions and statistical systems still do not adequately reflect women 's productive work in the non-market economy , as producers in subsistence agriculture and in the urban and rural informal sector .  
It welcomed the active cooperation of the Statistical Division , the regional commissions and various international agencies , as well as national statistical offices , to promote , in a harmonized manner , the implementation of regional and global comparisons , and full-scale and reduced information surveys , and to explore the use of purchasing power parities for aggregation .

As mentioned in the paragraph on the status of Iraq contained in its report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , 1 / the Committee on Contributions stated that some of its members were of the opinion that the waiver of Article 19 for Iraq should be recommended , whereas other members were of the view that the Committee did not have adequate statistical information on the current economic and financial situation of Iraq .  
In paragraph 42 of the report of the Secretary - General , we read that the Commission has already established an Expert Group on the Statistical Implications of Recent Major United Nations Conferences to draw up a work programme reflecting the major action areas identified by the Summit and indicators where international statistical work in the social field should be concentrated .  
9 One respondent concurred with the proposal for annual instead of quarterly statistical reporting on international trade in narcotic drugs but added that quarterly reconciliation at the domestic level would have to be maintained .  
Global statistical surveys and methodologies for data collection and the development of indicators , especially for use at the national level , are crucial for comprehensive and uniform data collection from which global trends can be identified , which are in turn the basis for intergovernmental policy recommendations .  
Although it is difficult to make precise statements about the contribution of the various components of domestic demand to overall growth ( because of the often large statistical discrepancies in the national accounts ) , it does appear that fixed investment is now playing an increasingly important role in the economic recovery of eastern Europe .  
Strengthening international data collection and statistical systems to support countries in monitoring social development goals and encouraging the expansion of international databases to incorporate socially beneficial activities that are not included in available data , such as women 's unremunerated work and contributions to society , the informal economy and sustainable livelihoods ;  
A major regional project covering 26 countries in eastern Europe and CIS was launched in 1995 and executed by ECE to assist national statistical offices in developing the human resources necessary for building self-sustainable capabilities for the collection , processing and analysis of reliable social and demographic statistics , and enabling the appropriate governmental institutions and agencies of these countries to monitor the social aspects of development .  
The Commission also established the Expert Group on the Statistical Implications of Recent Major United Nations Conferences to draw up a work programme reflecting the major action areas identified by the Summit and indicators where international statistical work in the social field should be concentrated .  
The integrity of the statistical institution ( i.e . , whether it operated under a published statistical law and independently of political interference ) , the transparency of the statistical production and dissemination process , and public and equal access to information were three important concerns for winning the trust of users in official economic statistics .  
The Expert Group recognized the need to create forums in which national statistical agency experts could address technical issues , and emphasized that informal ad hoc groups comprised of representatives of a small number of countries , constituted along the lines of the Voorburg Group on Service Statistics , could play an effective role in addressing such technical issues due to their greater flexibility compared to intersecretariat groups .  12 .  For each issue identified , the Expert Group reviewed ongoing research and existing coordination processes at the international level .  
Although some participants stressed the need to respond in a flexible manner to the demand for economic information for decision-making , including forecasting , others raised the potential conflict of interest in national statistical offices , first making projections and then publishing official statistics that either corroborated or invalidated their own projections .  
The problem of communicating how information should be used involved three challenges : how to measure the uncertainty underlying estimates of economic aggregates , such as gross domestic product ( GDP ) ; how to communicate that degree of uncertainty to users ; and how to communicate the conceptual relevance of alternative statistical measures , such as matching available price measures to administrative and policy uses , to different users .  
The Expert Group emphasized the importance of the IMF initiative for improving the reliability , comparability and credibility of economic information worldwide , noting that national statistical offices would be responsible for its implementation .  
A five-year plan had been prepared for the Afro-Colombian population to give impetus to the organization of their communities , through the strengthening of advisory committees at the departmental , regional and district levels and the undertaking of research projects , and particularly one aimed at compiling basic statistical data on that population group and another aimed at preparing a map of socio-cultural zones and regions with majority black populations .

Mechanisms like the present draft protocol must serve as a tool for embodying in international law the obvious need to set up committees of inquiry that would take responsibility together with Governments for the preparation of national reports determined to present the true facts and statistical data reflecting the truth .  
Specify the expected benefits in terms of generating more robust results by addressing issues , such as the adequacy of the sampling design , the choice of aggregation methods , the treatment of quality differences and technologically advanced products , the balance between exercising expert judgement and applying scientific statistical methods , and other issues of concern .  
The Plan of Action is based on three cardinal principles : the central role of an improved statistical system in economic and social development ; the key role of ECA in the development and promotion of statistics in Africa without prejudice to the role of other agencies and donors ; and the need to coordinate the support provided by international agencies and donors .  
Within that meeting , a programme of activities has been developed and the functions of regional and international cooperation in the statistical field have been distributed in the areas of national accounts ; environmental statistics ; dissemination of information ; and social and demographic indicators .  
In other fields , such as the institutional aspects of national statistical offices , the informal sector and external trade , less structured activities have also been defined and the objective exists of incorporating them into the regional programme .  
In the context of reform of the United Nations in general and of the regional commissions in particular , the role of statistics divisions should be enhanced towards more efficient monitoring of progress in global and regional developments , as well as towards assisting the national statistical organizations of developing countries to become more responsive to national and international needs for timely and efficient statistics .  
The Begeer report assumed that the existing international statistical system , which is decentralized in both the subject and regional dimensions , would continue unchanged , an assumption that is critical to its recommendations .  
As to the decentralized nature of the international statistical system in terms of subject , member States should be able to take a holistic view across all subject areas of the international statistical system , which at the moment is not possible because there are no mechanisms or processes in place for doing so ; the Commission itself does not have a broad enough reach and the individual components of the international statistical system are quite heterogeneous . 
There are four main types of statistical activity and output : ( a ) methodological studies and the convening of ad hoc expert group meetings with a view to the formulation of international recommendations and guidelines for data collection ; ( b ) parliamentary services to intergovernmental bodies , consisting of reports and substantive servicing of intergovernmental meetings ; ( c ) compilation of international statistics into databases and the dissemination of the data in them through statistical publications , on-line access and customized data services ; and ( d ) support to technical cooperation projects .  
There is broad agreement on the need for the active involvement of expert groups from among national statistical offices in the elaboration of definitions and measurement standards on complex social phenomena and in the elaboration of classification systems for critical economic issues and the environment . 
Both recurrent and non-recurrent statistical publications of the Statistics Division are distributed , free of charge , to permanent missions , foreign ministries and other official recipients on mailing lists maintained by the Office of Conference Services of the Secretariat and to national and international statistical offices and United Nations agencies and others who assist the Division in data collection or analysis , on mailing lists maintained by the Division .  
The Division concluded that in future it would ( a ) only undertake projects in areas where the need for the analytical and technical capacity of the Division was apparent ; ( b ) support and encourage greater involvement of the regional commissions ; ( c ) assign higher priority to projects that emphasized training and short-term technical assistance ; and ( d ) participate in implementing statistical projects only when projects were of significant international or methodological interest or where staff exposure through participation in project activities was seen as a learning opportunity .  
Indicators and best practices ( global urban observatory ) ; policy framework for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; global analysis of national enabling legislation and public policy formulation required for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; and human settlement conditions and trends : country profiles and statistical analysis ;

The final document of the Bucharest meeting contained specific recommendations on organizing national consultative processes involving civil society with a view to elaborating and implementing national plans , integrating activities designed to strengthen national structures working for the advancement of women within the context of administrative reform , establishing cooperation mechanisms between governments and non-governmental organizations , and conducting research and gathering statistical data on the role of women in society .  
After giving statistical data on the subject , she mentioned some of the forms of discrimination that women faced when accessing the job market , including unequal access to training and retraining and to credit and other productive resources , and low participation in economic decision-making and in collective bargaining structures .  
She welcomed the efforts made by the United Nations Statistical Commission to develop a minimum national social data set , disaggregated by gender , as a guide for national statistical services in monitoring the implementation of the outcomes of recent United Nations conferences , and encouraged the Commission to consider adopting the minimum data set , together with the recommendations , so that the regional commissions could conduct pilot studies in each region on the availability and quality of the required statistics .

The Committee congratulates the Government for the high level and large size of its delegation , headed by the Permanent Representative to the United Nations , which established a constructive , open and sincere dialogue with members of the Committee , and in its oral presentation gave additional specific and objective information as well as statistical data enabling the Committee to understand the de jure and de facto situation of Algerian women .  
While the former provide mainly statistical information and important economic and social indicators , the information gathered from the relevant academic literature , from non-governmental organizations and from the press tends , by its very nature , to be more critical of the political , economic and social conditions in the countries concerned .  
Support to member States to improve their national statistical services has taken the form of advisory services in the areas of statistical organization and management and improvement of basic economic statistics to promote capacity-building , as well as technical publications designed to apprise countries of the region of current approaches and best practices .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
a The Mondorf seminars were a series of annual meetings ( 1994-1996 ) focusing on the theme The future of social statistics , in which the directors of social statistics of certain national statistical institutes , along with representatives of the relevant directorates of the European Commission and university research bodies , came together for free and informal discussions .  
The new guidelines , intended for use by statistical compilers , data users and policy officials , will provide methodological standards for the compilation of statistics on external debt based on the international investment position framework and concept ; practical guidance for the compilation of these statistics ; and selected topics on the use of external debt data in the analysis of macroeconomic sustainability and external vulnerability .  
ProgWork.nsf ) is composed of two parts : the work in progress part , containing information on planned or current work in progress of the international organizations ; and the completed work part , which provides details and annotations on previously adopted statistical standards and published methodological work .  
As explained above ( para . 131 ) , the application of the agreed set of criteria for the designation of least developed countries goes beyond statistical calculations particularly in otherwise marginal cases to the careful assessment both of the numerical results and of supplementary information to be collected , especially a set of vulnerability profiles .  
Detailed information , including the latest statistical data , is also requested on the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights in East Jerusalem , keeping in mind the concerns raised by the Committee in the relevant paragraphs of these concluding observations .  
Yet it further stated that , apart from the statistical definition of the term youth mentioned above , the meaning of the term youth varied in different societies around the world and that definitions of youth had changed continuously in response to fluctuating political , economic and sociocultural circumstances .  
Given this connectivity and owing to limited resources of national and other statistical offices for maintaining , updating and revising their standard classifications , agreement must be reached on the timing of further revisions of such linked international standards as the ones mentioned above so that all may change together in a more harmonious and minimally disruptive fashion .  
Jointly published by ISI and the IOS Press , the book contains 19 chapters written by leading educators and researchers from several countries , discussing the conceptual and pragmatic issues in the assessment of statistical knowledge , reasoning skills and dispositions of students in diverse contexts of instruction , both at the college and at the pre-college levels .  
This relates to the familiar basic questions of whether the concept is correctly defined and meaningful , whether the statistical methodology identified fits the conceptual definitions and model selected , and whether the statistics collected map both reality and the conceptual and methodological foundations .  
The Bank has identified a number of instances where less than satisfactory attention was paid by national statistical offices to verifying and validating the basic data on which , subsequently , PPP calculations had to be made at the regional level .  
The Committee congratulated the representative of the State party for having established a constructive , open and sincere dialogue with members of the Committee by providing , both in its oral report and in its answers , specific , objective and statistical information , thereby enabling the Committee to understand the de jure and de facto situation of Algerian women .  
An estimated amount of $ 152 , 000 , at the maintenance level , would be required for official travel of the staff of the Division to participate in global , regional , subregional and national conferences , meetings , seminars and symposia that call for coordination and the Divisions input for statistical development ; to assist Member States in institutional development in statistics ; and to ensure collaboration and liaison with the regional commissions on matters relating to statistical development .

The first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Vancouver , Canada , 1976 ) was supported by producing a statistical annex , h a set of derived measures combined with raw data , used for supporting the major findings and recommendations of the Conference .  
There is a pressing need for a substantial increase in the level of funding and its effective use to coordinate coherent and sustainable approaches to statistical capacitybuilding .  
For statistical capacity to be treated as a priority by national Governments and international agencies , the awareness of the importance of timely and relevant statistics for policy , management , monitoring and democratic accountability needs to be raised .  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) timely , reliable and relevant national statistics on economic and social areas will be made available , especially gender-sensitive statistics ; and ( b ) member States are fully committed to further enhancing the capacity of statistical staff on various statistical issues and packages presented by ESCWA , and to this end their full participation in training workshops conducted by ESCWA will be instrumental .  
However , the fact that only nine responses indicated that their authors used the instrument developed by the Centre renders those responses of limited value for analytical , comparative or statistical purposes , or for the purpose of establishing a consolidated database for coordination of and information on international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Urge States to establish , on the basis of existing statistical information , national programmes , including affirmative action measures , to promote the access of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities to education , medical care and basic social services ;  
It also decided to limit requests for written information to statistical data ; information requested in the Committees reporting guidelines , but missing from the report ; points of clarification regarding the report ; and information on key legal , structural , policy or institutional issues or new developments .  
In future , it will limit requests for written information to statistical data , information requested in the guidelines but missing in the report points of clarification regarding the report , and information on key legal , structural , policy and institutional issues ( for the initial report ) or new developments ( with regard to periodic reports ) .  
However , it was also recognized that , apart from that statistical definition , the meaning of the term youth varied in different societies around the world and that definitions of youth had changed continuously in response to fluctuating political , economic and socio-cultural circumstances .  
Several challenges which faced the implementation of commitments and for monitoring included : the need to reverse the declining trend in the levels of external resources , including the need for a substantial increase in the UNCTAD LDCs Trust Fund ; and the need to improve the measurement tools through the strengthening of national statistical systems to generate and manage relevant data in LDCs , as recognized in the Programme of Action .  
States are invited to compile and publish statistical data broken down by racial and ethnic groups in the areas of health , system of criminal justice , housing , education and employment , with a view to determining whether policies or programmes are having a disproportionate impact on such groups , and to take supplementary measures , when drawing up and evaluating individual policies and programmes , in order to remedy such impact ;  
The meeting noted ( a ) the importance of adopting poverty monitoring plans agreed by all stakeholders , with external assistance to promote the dialogue ; ( b ) the need for strategic statistical plans to be jointly developed by all stakeholders , including planners , civil society , donors and the international community ; and ( c ) that the generation of community-level statistics was facilitated through cost-sharing , for example , when local authorities funded the field costs of surveys in their locality .  
A second stakeholder issue is that although the statistical indicators that are derived from United Nations conferences and summits are motivated by international needs , they are based on policy issues that must be reflected in the national policy agenda if the desired progress is to be achieved . 
That measure could be based on the level of regular statistical activity within a country , an ongoing critical mass of survey-taking and statistical analysis , and the existence of basic elements of statistical infrastructure .  
One concern is that that initiative and the resulting indicator should not be dominated by economic statistics but should span the wide range of statistical areas covered by national statistical systems and the indicators considered in the present report .  
However , as statistical capacity develops the technical standards that one may apply to any indicator may be increased : definitions may be refined and the quality of the indicator at a global level improved .  
Organization of two regional training workshops for experts of national statistical offices and other public institutes responsible for official statistics , one on the production , standardization and dissemination of social statistics , social indicators and the analysis of the social situation ; and the other on the production , standardization and dissemination of environmental statistics and indicators and the analysis of the state of environment in the region ;  
To ensure that institutions responsible for providing statistical information on the population take explicit account of the existence of [ indigenous peoples , people of varying descent and other ethnic groups , ] capturing the component parts of their diversity according to their needs and obtain data on relevant and appropriate characteristics , designing strategies to evaluate the human rights all policies concerning ethnic groups .
