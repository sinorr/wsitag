In summary , each of these examples underscores a number of elements that are unique to indigenous peoples : ( 1 ) a profound relationship between indigenous peoples and their lands , territories and resources exists ; ( 2 ) that this relationship has various social , cultural , spiritual , economic and political dimensions and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) that the collective dimension of this relationship is significant ; and ( 4 ) that the inter-generational aspect of such a relationship is also crucial to indigenous peoples identity , survival and cultural viability .  
At his initial appearance on 31 May 1996 before Trial Chamber I , composed of Judge Jorda ( presiding ) , Judge Odio-Benito and Judge Riad , Dra _ en Erdemovi _ pleaded guilty to one count of a crime against humanity for his participation in the summary execution of approximately 1,200 unarmed civilian Muslim men at a farm near Pilica , located in the Zvornik municipality of eastern Bosnia , following the fall of Srebrenica to Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995 .  
The allegations of summary , arbitrary and extrajudicial executions reported to him from many parts of the country were not surprising , because Iraqi legislation routinely prescribed the death penalty , even for minor offences , and also because the special security services and important figures in the regime had the power to take peoples lives at will ; the Iraqi Government made no attempt whatsoever to change that state of affairs , which it even justified on the grounds that the situation was difficult and that crime was on the increase .  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons , enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expressions , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;

In paragraph 6 , the General Assembly requested JIU to seek a more reader - friendly and uniform format of reports , taking into account new publishing technologies , which would include sections containing the objectives of the report , an executive summary , the conclusions drawn and , as appropriate , the action required to be taken by the organizations , in order to make reports as concise as possible and to comply with the existing page limit of 32 pages .  
The attention of the Commission is also drawn to Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 295 of 24 July 1996 , by which the Council , taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1996 / 111 of 23 April 1996 , decided to authorize , if possible within existing financial resources , 40 fully serviced additional meetings , including summary records , in accordance with rules 29 and 31 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , for the Commission 's fifty _ third session .  
For instance , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to receive information about massive displacements of populations which have occurred mainly in the context of armed conflicts , including indiscriminate military attacks against civilians during counter-insurgency operations , attacks by irregular armed groups , and communal violence .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
Although the Special Rapporteur notes that there presently does not appear to exist an explicit or systematic government policy of encouraging summary executions , he is greatly concerned by the frequent allegations of arbitrary killings of civilians and insurgents by members of the Tatmadaw under a variety of circumstances , in violation of the right to life contained in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
In addition to the Special Rapporteur 's participation in the special rapporteurs ' meeting and in joint urgent actions transmitted to Governments , in 1996 the Special Rapporteur requested to undertake a joint mission to Nigeria with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
This could be achieved through a summary report which would be compiled and coordinated by the Office of Internal Oversight Services and submitted to the General Assembly in accordance with paragraph 5 ( e ) ( ii ) of resolution 48 / 218 B . The report would be based on submissions from the operational funds and programmes which would be forwarded to the Office by their executive heads after discussion and approval , as appropriate , by the respective governing bodies . 
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
The present document is an analytical summary of the main points to which ICRC attaches special importance and which it has endeavoured to address in recent years , namely , minimum age of recruitment , minimum age of participation in hostilities , the notions of direct and indirect participation , the notions of armed conflict and hostilities , compulsory recruitment and voluntary enlistment , and armed groups .

Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
A short but substantive / analytical / factual summary prepared by the Secretariat of the informal consultations of the Security Council should be circulated as an official document of the Council to all Member States the day after such meetings .  
Mangoaela ( Lesotho ) : Allow me to present to this plenary meeting of the General Assembly a summary of one of the two ministerial round tables on social and economic impact of globalization , the one on national responses that was held this morning .  
The systematic and planned killing , deportation , rape , summary execution , abduction , arbitrary detention and looting was perpetrated by the Taliban while Pakistani military personnel accompanied and assisted the Taliban .  
In most of the cases reported to the Working Group , the sources alleged that the individuals are being held incommunicado and they express a fear that the victims may be subjected to torture or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
At the closing plenary meeting , rapporteurs designated for each of the ministerial round tables would present their summary reports , and all minister participants would be expected to join in a final , interactive discussion .  
Consequently , the appellate court found that the affidavits of the subjective intent of both parties raised sufficient factual question as to the terms of the parties contract under article 8 ( 1 ) CISG that summary judgment was inappropriate .  
Social development is impossible when basic essential social services are denied to the civilian population and where vulnerable members of the community are indiscriminately exposed to bombing , summary execution , rape and the threat of landmines .  
Strongly condemns summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings , enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , and calls upon the Government of Iraq to provide an accounting for the clean-out of prisons where there is credible evidence of mass summary executions ;  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
Even if the case results in the summary dismissal of a staff member , the evidence may not be sufficient to satisfy the standard of proof applicable in criminal matters considered by national courts .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted by the Committee .

Legislative organs should request Executive Heads of each organization to submit a consolidated annual summary report on internal oversight activities that concisely provides ( i ) an overview of the issues addressed and accomplishments achieved ; ( ii ) a record of recommendations made and status of actions taken on them ; and ( iii ) issues or recommendations requiring action by Executive Heads or legislative organs .  
During their joint visit to Colombia in October 1994 , the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on torture both drew attention to the need to strengthen the ordinary justice system to make it universally more efficient , so that it would no longer be necessary to resort to special justice systems , such as the system of regional justice ( see report E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 111 ) .  
The 1998 report and the 1998 interim report ( memorandum ) of the previous Special Rapporteur referred to alleged massacres and summary executions , to outbursts of ethnic violence and other violations of human rights ranging from the infliction of inhuman and degrading punishment to systematic gender discrimination , including denial to women of access to medical care and employment .  
The status of IAEA verification activities in Iraq is unchanged from that reported in document S / 1999 / 127 , which was provided as a summary document to facilitate the work of the panel on disarmament and current and future ongoing monitoring and verification issues established pursuant to document S / 1999 / 100 of 30 January 1999 .

Expresses deep concern at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence , in particular against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system , essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ;  
The Sub-Commission 's working methods in respect of its research and study projects should , consistent with the independent expert character of the body , entail a well-prepared , thorough peer-review process culminating in an analytical report to the Commission comprising the final text of the study in question , any agreed recommendations on further steps and a summary of major observations of members of the Sub-Commission .

Accounts received by the High Commissioner and OHCHR staff in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Albania and Montenegro ( Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) provide substantial evidence of gross human rights violations which have been committed in Kosovo , including summary executions , forcible displacement , rape , physical abuse , and the destruction of property and identity documents .  
A staff member whose appointment is terminated for unsatisfactory services or who for disciplinary reasons is dismissed for misconduct other than by summary dismissal may be paid , at the discretion of the Secretary-General , an indemnity not exceeding one half of the indemnity provided under paragraph ( a ) of the present annex .  
In response to reports of summary executions of non-combatants , including women and children , in their homes , arbitrary detentions , forced displacement , use of forced labour and burning of homes and property in the central highlands of Hazarajat , the Special Rapporteur visited Quetta , Pakistan , on 22 May where he met refugees who provided credible eye-witness accounts of gross violations of human rights during March , April and May 1999 . 
As part of an effort to make both national and international public opinion aware of the massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards , the Government of National Salvation , through the Ministry of Human Rights , has taken the initiative of issuing periodic publications which provide a summary account of the conduct of the aggressor States of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
They expressed serious concern with regard to grave breaches , breaches and violations by Israel , the occupying Power , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , including arbitrary detention , ill-treatment of and violence against the civilian population , torture , summary execution , confiscation and destruction of property , forcible transfers and deportations , and the various forms of collective punishment , as well as the destruction of economic and social structures of the Occupied Territory .

A staff member whose appointment is terminated for unsatisfactory service or who for disciplinary reasons is dismissed for misconduct other than by summary dismissal may be paid , at the discretion of the Secretary-General , an indemnity not exceeding one half of the indemnity provided under paragraph ( a ) of the present annex ;  
Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents .

It considers that the summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States represents an important contribution to the constructive application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .  
The annual summary of the economic and social situation in Africa submitted this year to the Economic and Social Council put the figure for gross domestic product growth in 1998 at 3.3 per cent , up from 2.9 per cent in 1997 , the highest growth rate of any region in the world ; it reported that the 33 African least developed countries increased their growth rate from 2.4 per cent in 1997 to 4.1 per cent in 1998 . 
Warfare in the central highlands in April and May involved vicious attacks against civilians , including the summary execution of women and children , forced and involuntary displacement , the looting and burning of homes , arbitrary detention and the use of forced labour . 
Despite repeated appeals from United Nations bodies , bombing of the civilian population , enforced displacement both within and outside the country , summary and extrajudicial execution , violation of the right to life and the right to physical safety of prisoners of war , attacks on the civilian population , abduction and subjection to forced labour of women and children and obstruction of humanitarian assistance continued unabated .  
Noting with concern the resulting exacerbation of the enormous suffering of the Afghan people , resulting in the massive loss of human life , summary executions , the deliberate abuse and arbitrary detention of civilians , refugee flows , the use of child soldiers , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive destruction ,  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Ms . A . Jahangir , in her report to the Commission at its fifty-fifth session ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 ) stated that the execution of a death sentence passed after a trial in which basic fair trial standards , as provided for in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , were not respected , constituted a violation of the right to life .  
The Special Rapporteur , in an addendum to her report , on country situations ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 / Add . 1 ) , stated that she had received numerous allegations concerning extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions committed by armed insurgent groups in Sierra Leone .  
Through such interim decisions , the treaty bodies ( as well as some of the Commissions special procedures mechanisms such as the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ) have obtained temporary or permanent relief for countless potential victims in cases concerning , for example , stays of imminent execution , commutation of death sentences , or deferrals of extradition , expulsion or deportation orders .  
This report contained the conclusions and a summary of deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting , held in New York from 24 to 28 June 1998 , concerning the development of a possible methodology for assessing the consequences actually incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and the exploration of innovative and practical measures of international assistance that could be provided to said third States .  
The attention of the Commission is also drawn to Economic and Social Council decision 1998-281 , by which the Council , taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1998-111 , decided to authorize , if possible within existing financial resources , 30 fully serviced additional meetings , including summary records , in accordance with rules 29 and 31 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , for the Commission ' s fifty _ fifth session .  
In his concluding remarks and recommendations , the Special Rapporteur noted that one of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to be persons preventing and combating racial , ethnic or religious discrimination , and persons belonging to minorities .  
A staff member whose appointment is terminated for unsatisfactory services or who for disciplinary reasons is dismissed for misconduct other than by summary dismissal may be paid , at the discretion of the Registrar , an indemnity not exceeding one half of the indemnity provided under subparagraph ( a ) .  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo , affecting ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo personnel and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
The human rights violations reported to him by credible eyewitnesses had included forced displacement of the civilian population , deliberate burning of houses , summary execution of noncombatants , arbitrary detention and forced labour .  
The United Kingdom had published an initial report on past production of fissile material for defence purposes and was circulating a summary paper on its main conclusions and the role of such work in nuclear disarmament .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the brief historical summary on the consideration in the Legal Subcommittee of the question on the definition and delimitation of outer space , which the working group had requested the Secretariat to prepare , would be most useful for the continued discussions in 2002 , as it would assist in identifying positions that had developed over the years under the item and reduce the likelihood of a repetition of previous discussions .  
COHCHR has also received allegations of police violence and excessive use of force , summary and extrajudicial execution , disappearance , mob killings , torture , political intimidation and violence against members of political parties , in particular the opposition party , including instances of extrajudicial execution , interference of the executive in judicial matters , curtailment of the freedom of association and expression and intimidation of human rights defenders .  
With respect to cases of honour killing considered by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers expressed his concern in regard to these instances of summary execution and urged the Governments concerned to bring those responsible to justice .  
She further notes with regret that in some countries Governments have made use of excessive and indiscriminate force in their efforts to counter armed opposition groups , which in some cases has involved summary executions of captured combatants and resulted in extensive civilian casualties and fatalities .  
Concern has been expressed that , where the summary of a 1503 communication is edited to eliminate material that may not deal expressly with the rights of women , this may distort the overall gist of the communication and may make it difficult to evaluate a governmental response that addresses all issues raised in the original communication .  
The lack of political will , an unrepresentative Council distanced from ground realities when mandating peacekeeping operations without taking the views of troop-contributing countries into account , unwise reliance on regional solutions , a commitment gap resulting in the United Nations accepting inadequate units as a matter of political expediency , and a financially burdened Organization trying to overreach itself are , in summary , the crux of the problems confronting United Nations peacekeeping .  
The social and cultural impact of territorial fragmentation does not lend itself easily to a summary in numerical terms , but the scenario in that area is no less severe than that depicted in relation to the economic rights data .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted by the Committee .

For example , half of the respondents considered that a summary of each report should be provided well in advance of meetings and that Secretariat briefings should be organized on key reports , highlighting their policy implications and clarifying technical concepts .  
Deeply concerned at continued reports of widespread violence against civilians and on alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , torture , arbitrary detentions , ad hoc detention locations and continued abuses and harassment at checkpoints by Russian State agents in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation ,

Reiterates its requests that the relevant special rapporteurs and the special mechanisms of the Commission undertake missions to the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation without delay and expresses serious concern that the thematic special rapporteurs or representatives on the question of torture , on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on internally displaced persons , who have requested to undertake visits have not yet received an answer and urges the Government of the Russian Federation to give favourable consideration to their requests as a matter of priority ;  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 55 / 111 of 4 December 2000 , in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty-seventh session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,

Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,

The report of the Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , from which the relevant provisions of resolution 1995 / 34 derived , identified grave violations of human rights as involving the following : genocide , slavery , summary executions , torture , enforced disappearances , arbitrary and prolonged detention , deportation or forcible transfer of population or systematic discrimination .  
Further , it should be emphasized that all allegations contained in the interim report had been transmitted to the Government during the course of 1996 by special rapporteurs and working groups of the Commission on Human Rights , including the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , on the question of torture and on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention .  
For three years the daily life of Haitians was marked by murders , summary and extrajudicial executions , enforced disappearances , arbitrary arrests , rape , torture , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , extortion , and destruction or confiscation of property .  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Finally , in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies submitted by Bulgaria be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .

Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Also strongly urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression and assembly , the right to fair trial and the protection of the rights of persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities , and to put an end to violations of the right to life and integrity of the human being , to the practices of torture , abuse of women , forced labour and forced relocations and to enforced disappearances and summary executions ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
In summary , each of these examples underscores a number of elements that are unique to indigenous peoples : ( 1 ) a profound relationship between indigenous peoples and their lands , territories and resources exists ; ( 2 ) that this relationship has various social , cultural , spiritual , economic and political dimensions and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) that the collective dimension of this relationship is significant ; and ( 4 ) that the inter-generational aspect of such a relationship is also crucial to indigenous peoples identity , survival and cultural viability .  
At his initial appearance on 31 May 1996 before Trial Chamber I , composed of Judge Jorda ( presiding ) , Judge Odio-Benito and Judge Riad , Dra _ en Erdemovi _ pleaded guilty to one count of a crime against humanity for his participation in the summary execution of approximately 1,200 unarmed civilian Muslim men at a farm near Pilica , located in the Zvornik municipality of eastern Bosnia , following the fall of Srebrenica to Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995 .  
The allegations of summary , arbitrary and extrajudicial executions reported to him from many parts of the country were not surprising , because Iraqi legislation routinely prescribed the death penalty , even for minor offences , and also because the special security services and important figures in the regime had the power to take peoples lives at will ; the Iraqi Government made no attempt whatsoever to change that state of affairs , which it even justified on the grounds that the situation was difficult and that crime was on the increase .  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons , enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expressions , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;

In paragraph 6 , the General Assembly requested JIU to seek a more reader - friendly and uniform format of reports , taking into account new publishing technologies , which would include sections containing the objectives of the report , an executive summary , the conclusions drawn and , as appropriate , the action required to be taken by the organizations , in order to make reports as concise as possible and to comply with the existing page limit of 32 pages .  
The attention of the Commission is also drawn to Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 295 of 24 July 1996 , by which the Council , taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1996 / 111 of 23 April 1996 , decided to authorize , if possible within existing financial resources , 40 fully serviced additional meetings , including summary records , in accordance with rules 29 and 31 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , for the Commission 's fifty _ third session .  
For instance , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to receive information about massive displacements of populations which have occurred mainly in the context of armed conflicts , including indiscriminate military attacks against civilians during counter-insurgency operations , attacks by irregular armed groups , and communal violence .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
Although the Special Rapporteur notes that there presently does not appear to exist an explicit or systematic government policy of encouraging summary executions , he is greatly concerned by the frequent allegations of arbitrary killings of civilians and insurgents by members of the Tatmadaw under a variety of circumstances , in violation of the right to life contained in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
In addition to the Special Rapporteur 's participation in the special rapporteurs ' meeting and in joint urgent actions transmitted to Governments , in 1996 the Special Rapporteur requested to undertake a joint mission to Nigeria with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
This could be achieved through a summary report which would be compiled and coordinated by the Office of Internal Oversight Services and submitted to the General Assembly in accordance with paragraph 5 ( e ) ( ii ) of resolution 48 / 218 B . The report would be based on submissions from the operational funds and programmes which would be forwarded to the Office by their executive heads after discussion and approval , as appropriate , by the respective governing bodies . 
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
The present document is an analytical summary of the main points to which ICRC attaches special importance and which it has endeavoured to address in recent years , namely , minimum age of recruitment , minimum age of participation in hostilities , the notions of direct and indirect participation , the notions of armed conflict and hostilities , compulsory recruitment and voluntary enlistment , and armed groups .  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;

Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
A short but substantive / analytical / factual summary prepared by the Secretariat of the informal consultations of the Security Council should be circulated as an official document of the Council to all Member States the day after such meetings .  
Mangoaela ( Lesotho ) : Allow me to present to this plenary meeting of the General Assembly a summary of one of the two ministerial round tables on social and economic impact of globalization , the one on national responses that was held this morning .  
The systematic and planned killing , deportation , rape , summary execution , abduction , arbitrary detention and looting was perpetrated by the Taliban while Pakistani military personnel accompanied and assisted the Taliban .  
In most of the cases reported to the Working Group , the sources alleged that the individuals are being held incommunicado and they express a fear that the victims may be subjected to torture or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
At the closing plenary meeting , rapporteurs designated for each of the ministerial round tables would present their summary reports , and all minister participants would be expected to join in a final , interactive discussion .  
Consequently , the appellate court found that the affidavits of the subjective intent of both parties raised sufficient factual question as to the terms of the parties contract under article 8 ( 1 ) CISG that summary judgment was inappropriate .  
Social development is impossible when basic essential social services are denied to the civilian population and where vulnerable members of the community are indiscriminately exposed to bombing , summary execution , rape and the threat of landmines .  
Strongly condemns summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings , enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , and calls upon the Government of Iraq to provide an accounting for the clean-out of prisons where there is credible evidence of mass summary executions ;  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
Even if the case results in the summary dismissal of a staff member , the evidence may not be sufficient to satisfy the standard of proof applicable in criminal matters considered by national courts .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted by the Committee .

Legislative organs should request Executive Heads of each organization to submit a consolidated annual summary report on internal oversight activities that concisely provides ( i ) an overview of the issues addressed and accomplishments achieved ; ( ii ) a record of recommendations made and status of actions taken on them ; and ( iii ) issues or recommendations requiring action by Executive Heads or legislative organs .  
During their joint visit to Colombia in October 1994 , the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on torture both drew attention to the need to strengthen the ordinary justice system to make it universally more efficient , so that it would no longer be necessary to resort to special justice systems , such as the system of regional justice ( see report E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 111 ) .  
The 1998 report and the 1998 interim report ( memorandum ) of the previous Special Rapporteur referred to alleged massacres and summary executions , to outbursts of ethnic violence and other violations of human rights ranging from the infliction of inhuman and degrading punishment to systematic gender discrimination , including denial to women of access to medical care and employment .  
The status of IAEA verification activities in Iraq is unchanged from that reported in document S / 1999 / 127 , which was provided as a summary document to facilitate the work of the panel on disarmament and current and future ongoing monitoring and verification issues established pursuant to document S / 1999 / 100 of 30 January 1999 . 
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 53 / 147 of 9 December 1998 in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty _ fifth session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
Expresses deep concern at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence , in particular against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system , essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ;  
The Sub-Commission 's working methods in respect of its research and study projects should , consistent with the independent expert character of the body , entail a well-prepared , thorough peer-review process culminating in an analytical report to the Commission comprising the final text of the study in question , any agreed recommendations on further steps and a summary of major observations of members of the Sub-Commission .

Accounts received by the High Commissioner and OHCHR staff in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Albania and Montenegro ( Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) provide substantial evidence of gross human rights violations which have been committed in Kosovo , including summary executions , forcible displacement , rape , physical abuse , and the destruction of property and identity documents .  
A staff member whose appointment is terminated for unsatisfactory services or who for disciplinary reasons is dismissed for misconduct other than by summary dismissal may be paid , at the discretion of the Secretary-General , an indemnity not exceeding one half of the indemnity provided under paragraph ( a ) of the present annex .  
In response to reports of summary executions of non-combatants , including women and children , in their homes , arbitrary detentions , forced displacement , use of forced labour and burning of homes and property in the central highlands of Hazarajat , the Special Rapporteur visited Quetta , Pakistan , on 22 May where he met refugees who provided credible eye-witness accounts of gross violations of human rights during March , April and May 1999 . 
As part of an effort to make both national and international public opinion aware of the massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards , the Government of National Salvation , through the Ministry of Human Rights , has taken the initiative of issuing periodic publications which provide a summary account of the conduct of the aggressor States of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
They expressed serious concern with regard to grave breaches , breaches and violations by Israel , the occupying Power , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , including arbitrary detention , ill-treatment of and violence against the civilian population , torture , summary execution , confiscation and destruction of property , forcible transfers and deportations , and the various forms of collective punishment , as well as the destruction of economic and social structures of the Occupied Territory .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted by the Committee .

A staff member whose appointment is terminated for unsatisfactory service or who for disciplinary reasons is dismissed for misconduct other than by summary dismissal may be paid , at the discretion of the Secretary-General , an indemnity not exceeding one half of the indemnity provided under paragraph ( a ) of the present annex ;  
Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents .

It considers that the summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States represents an important contribution to the constructive application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .  
The annual summary of the economic and social situation in Africa submitted this year to the Economic and Social Council put the figure for gross domestic product growth in 1998 at 3.3 per cent , up from 2.9 per cent in 1997 , the highest growth rate of any region in the world ; it reported that the 33 African least developed countries increased their growth rate from 2.4 per cent in 1997 to 4.1 per cent in 1998 . 
Warfare in the central highlands in April and May involved vicious attacks against civilians , including the summary execution of women and children , forced and involuntary displacement , the looting and burning of homes , arbitrary detention and the use of forced labour . 
Despite repeated appeals from United Nations bodies , bombing of the civilian population , enforced displacement both within and outside the country , summary and extrajudicial execution , violation of the right to life and the right to physical safety of prisoners of war , attacks on the civilian population , abduction and subjection to forced labour of women and children and obstruction of humanitarian assistance continued unabated .  
Noting with concern the resulting exacerbation of the enormous suffering of the Afghan people , resulting in the massive loss of human life , summary executions , the deliberate abuse and arbitrary detention of civilians , refugee flows , the use of child soldiers , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive destruction ,  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Ms . A . Jahangir , in her report to the Commission at its fifty-fifth session ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 ) stated that the execution of a death sentence passed after a trial in which basic fair trial standards , as provided for in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , were not respected , constituted a violation of the right to life .  
The Special Rapporteur , in an addendum to her report , on country situations ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 / Add . 1 ) , stated that she had received numerous allegations concerning extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions committed by armed insurgent groups in Sierra Leone .  
Through such interim decisions , the treaty bodies ( as well as some of the Commissions special procedures mechanisms such as the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ) have obtained temporary or permanent relief for countless potential victims in cases concerning , for example , stays of imminent execution , commutation of death sentences , or deferrals of extradition , expulsion or deportation orders .  
This report contained the conclusions and a summary of deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting , held in New York from 24 to 28 June 1998 , concerning the development of a possible methodology for assessing the consequences actually incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and the exploration of innovative and practical measures of international assistance that could be provided to said third States .  
The attention of the Commission is also drawn to Economic and Social Council decision 1998-281 , by which the Council , taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1998-111 , decided to authorize , if possible within existing financial resources , 30 fully serviced additional meetings , including summary records , in accordance with rules 29 and 31 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , for the Commission ' s fifty _ fifth session .  
In his concluding remarks and recommendations , the Special Rapporteur noted that one of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to be persons preventing and combating racial , ethnic or religious discrimination , and persons belonging to minorities .  
A staff member whose appointment is terminated for unsatisfactory services or who for disciplinary reasons is dismissed for misconduct other than by summary dismissal may be paid , at the discretion of the Registrar , an indemnity not exceeding one half of the indemnity provided under subparagraph ( a ) .  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo , affecting ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo personnel and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
The human rights violations reported to him by credible eyewitnesses had included forced displacement of the civilian population , deliberate burning of houses , summary execution of noncombatants , arbitrary detention and forced labour .  
The United Kingdom had published an initial report on past production of fissile material for defence purposes and was circulating a summary paper on its main conclusions and the role of such work in nuclear disarmament .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the brief historical summary on the consideration in the Legal Subcommittee of the question on the definition and delimitation of outer space , which the working group had requested the Secretariat to prepare , would be most useful for the continued discussions in 2002 , as it would assist in identifying positions that had developed over the years under the item and reduce the likelihood of a repetition of previous discussions .  
COHCHR has also received allegations of police violence and excessive use of force , summary and extrajudicial execution , disappearance , mob killings , torture , political intimidation and violence against members of political parties , in particular the opposition party , including instances of extrajudicial execution , interference of the executive in judicial matters , curtailment of the freedom of association and expression and intimidation of human rights defenders .  
With respect to cases of honour killing considered by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers expressed his concern in regard to these instances of summary execution and urged the Governments concerned to bring those responsible to justice .  
She further notes with regret that in some countries Governments have made use of excessive and indiscriminate force in their efforts to counter armed opposition groups , which in some cases has involved summary executions of captured combatants and resulted in extensive civilian casualties and fatalities .  
Concern has been expressed that , where the summary of a 1503 communication is edited to eliminate material that may not deal expressly with the rights of women , this may distort the overall gist of the communication and may make it difficult to evaluate a governmental response that addresses all issues raised in the original communication .  
The lack of political will , an unrepresentative Council distanced from ground realities when mandating peacekeeping operations without taking the views of troop-contributing countries into account , unwise reliance on regional solutions , a commitment gap resulting in the United Nations accepting inadequate units as a matter of political expediency , and a financially burdened Organization trying to overreach itself are , in summary , the crux of the problems confronting United Nations peacekeeping .  
The social and cultural impact of territorial fragmentation does not lend itself easily to a summary in numerical terms , but the scenario in that area is no less severe than that depicted in relation to the economic rights data .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted by the Committee .
