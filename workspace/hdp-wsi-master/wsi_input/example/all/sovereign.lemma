He also severely denounced some countries for putting regional organizations above the UN Security Council or even bypassing the UN Security Council to carry out military intervention in a sovereign country , pointing out that such practice has " severely damaged the existing international collective security mechanism , and the consequences are extremely dangerous . "  
The two countries ' foreign ministers called for the unconditional respect for the right of the people of all countries to choose social systems , value concepts , and ways of development in line with their countries ' conditions .  They considered the interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries on humanitarian grounds and in the name of protecting human rights constitute acts that violate the purpose and principle of the United Nations Charter .  
What is worthy of attention is that because the proposition on " Taiwan independence " has never been accepted by the majority of the Taiwan people , those who have adhered to " Taiwan independence , " have , out of current political needs , asserted that " Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country , " and Taiwan has never been recognized as a part of China 's territory .  
Sun Yuxi answered that last year , the US-led NATO used force against Yugoslavia , a sovereign country , using the Kosovo issue as an excuse .  This seriously violated the UN Charter and norms governing international relations and set an extremely dangerous precedent of armed intervention in the internal affairs of another country .  
In 1999 , the US-led NATO disregarded the norm of International Law and bypassed the UNSC and frenziedly bombed a sovereign state-the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for as long as 78 days , causing the biggest humanitarian disaster in Europe since the World War II , killed more than 2,000 innocent civilians , and wounded more than 6,000 people .  Some one-million people lost their homes and more than two-million people lost their sources of income .  The direct economic losses reached $ 600-billion yuan .  
All countries should have the right to act in line with their native national conditions to choose their respective political systems and development models .  No nation or group of states has the right to force its values and social system onto others , even less so to exploit the human rights matter or a so-called " humanitarian crisis " as an excuse to deliberately interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country .  
It is necessary to reiterate time and again and earnestly put into practice the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , persistent peaceful settlement of international disputes , sovereign equality of all countries , respect for the national conditions of countries , seeking common ground while shelving differences , and the principle of closer mutually-beneficial cooperation for common development .  All these principles should be observed by each and every country .  
This kind of " international interference " can only be applicable within the commonwealth of sovereign states basically sharing similar political systems , legal standards , and value concepts and reaching a common view on human rights .  
Thus , we must continue to enhance our national defense strength , and tempered a sharp and powerful " sword " of justice for safeguarding the sovereign and territorial integrity of socialist China and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation .  
In the 1999 Kosovo war , the United States further turned " humanitarian assistance " into a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state , raising the " non-war military operation " to a strategic level .  
After causing the incident , the US plane intruded into China 's territory and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , which further violated relevant provisions of international laws and Chinese laws , thereby constituting a violation of China 's sovereign right and territorial air space .  
Jiang Zemin said : " China and Chile are separated by vast oceans .  However , the common goal of safeguarding world peace , protecting sovereign rights , developing the national economy , and improving the people 's life has tightlyunited us . "  
To exercise sovereign right and exclusive jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone , the coastal state is entitled to draw up relevant laws and rules to restrict the overflight freedom enjoyed by another state 's aircraft in the airspace over the exclusive economic zone .  Doing so , the coastal state can safeguard the aerial traffic order and flight safety in the zone and protect its legal rights and interest .  
China 's military plane tailed after and conducted surveillance over the US military reconnaissance plane , which intruded into the airspace of our coastal exclusive economic zone to conduct military reconnaissance activities , according to the international law and China 's law .  Exercising sovereign right in the exclusive economic zone , and safeguarding the national defense security is just and legal behavior .  
Jiang Zemin said : China upholds an independent foreign policy of peace .  Its basic objective is one of safeguarding the country 's sovereign independence , territorial integrity , and national dignity , as well as one of opposing hegemonism , safeguarding world peace , promoting common development , and building an international environment of long-term peace and stability for China 's reforms , opening up and modernization drive .  
First they were confusing right and wrong , taking bites and demanding that China release the crew and the airplane .  Moreover , they absurdly claimed that the forced landing of the American spy plane at the Hainan Island airport was " US territory , " and that the United States had " sovereign exemption , " and China was not permitted to board the aircraft for inspection .  They completely disregarded the fact that the Chinese fighter plane had crashed and the pilot was lost , causing a tragedy for fellow Chinese officials and a Chinese household .  
In order to legalize this rude and unreasonable demand , the US side even made up the absurd argument that the US military plane causing the incident was a part of its territory and US state property and therefore , was eligible for sovereign immunity .  
A Recount of the Foreign Relations Act of the United States ( third edition ) , the most authoritative international law document of the United States , even says the agreement of the accepting state alone is not enough .  On the basis of such an agreement , the accepting state and the foreign country must also reach a special agreement on relevant community before the foreign military forces are eligible for sovereign immunity in the accepting state .  
As a result , the DPP government under Chen Shui-bian has the " multi-party coalition government " , and if there are contradictions among the various party factions on the one China or " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent nation " , no choice can be made , and no unified consensus can be formed .  So the enlightened coalition government trick will in the final analysis be only a struggle of private interests .  
In that period , China just witnessed the feudal dynasty 's surrendering of the nation 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the imperialist foreign powers ' despotic and domineering practice on its land , unceasing social turbulences , and the people 's miserable lives of suffering from hunger and cold . 
In the first 80-year period , the feudal rulers surrendered the country 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the whole society was thrown into utter chaos caused by wars , the country became impoverished and weak and the people lived in hunger and cold .  
The two countries hold that the challenges of the 21st century can only be overcome by abiding by the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and the acknowledged norms of international law , and taking into consideration the national characteristics and features of the people of all countries , and through the collective efforts of the international community , The two countries state that they will absolutely not accept any conspiracy for violating the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign states under any pretext . 
So far the Taiwan authorities have not yet renounced its separatistic position that " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent state , " have refused to accept the one-China principle , negated the " 1992 common understanding " and the goal of cross-strait reunification , and continued to carry out separatistic activities internationally ; they have further purchased advanced weapons , attempted to extend their influence by relying on foreigners and to refuse reunification by force .  This is why the root causes of tensions between the two sides of the strait still exist .  
In the first 80-year period , the feudal lords surrendered the country 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the whole society was thrown into utter chaos caused by wars , the country became impoverished and weak and the people lived in hunger and cold .  
By using force against the sovereign state of Yugoslavia , US-led NATO had not only seriously violated the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law and set an extremely dangerous example of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries , but had also further complicated the situation in the region .  
A spokesman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Dang said in Beijing today : When interviewed by a Hong Kong media unit a few days ago , Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] brazenly stuck to the stance of " Taiwan being a sovereign state " and argued that the two sides of the strait are two states of the Chinese based on the so-called " remote relative and close neighbor " theory .  Hence , she flagrantly challenged the one-China principle .  
In the " exclusive interview , " not only did Annette Lu manifest her die-hard " Taiwan independence " stance and plot of splittism , she also adopted a very contemptible means .  She used the Taiwan people as a " bargaining chip , " wantonly distorted facts and the Taiwan people 's desire , and created a false impression that Taiwan " is already a country of sovereign independence " in a vain attempt to create an excuse to " justify splittism . "  This fully displays the cunning side of her nature .  
Even though they do their utmost to play crafty tricks , saying that the two sides of the strait are two states and saying in another way round that the two sides of the strait can form a confederation or a compound state in the form of two sovereign states , this argument is not tenable in terms of legal principle and will not be recognized by the international community .

Xu Fangming listed the following facts to prove that China has no problem in repaying her sovereign foreign debts : Over the past 20 years since reform and opening up , China 's economy has developed by leaps and bounds , which has resulted in sustained , healthy , and stable national economic growth .  
While re-stressing the standpoints and viewpoints of the Chinese side , Chairman Li Peng emphasized that on the basis of safeguarding the basic norms of international relations China respects the independence , sovereignty , and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan , support the relevant resolutions of the United Nations regarding the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh and does not recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as a sovereign state nor the so-called " parliamentary election " held in this area .  
Third , the two countries shared common historical experiences .  China and Burma have constantly shown sympathy for and supported each other in their efforts for independence and liberation , safeguarding of national independence and sovereign and territorial integrity , and national construction .  Common national fates have closely linked the two countries together .  
In fact , since taking office Chen Shuibian has never acknowledged the " one China " principle ; he has repeatedly said that " Taiwan is a sovereign independent state , " blocked cross-strait political contacts and negotiations , and glibly talked about a " decisive battle offshore , " in a bid to reject reunification by using armed force ; and all this is related to the continual wrong signals being given by the United States .  
Making no mention whatsoever about the Taiwan authorities ' defeat in their internal struggles with the Mainland for the ruling power in China and in the external struggles for China 's representation , he simply characterizes the two sides of the strait as two independent sovereign countries since Taiwan was separated from the Mainland in 1949 .  
As the most representative and most authoritative international organization of sovereign states , the United Nations has played an irreplaceable role in maintaining world peace , promoting common development , and in establishing a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
In answering a question raised by a reporter at a news briefing held by the Foreign Ministry here today , Zhang Qiyue said relevant resolutions on Iraq adopted by the Security Council should be comprehensively and earnestly implemented , while the independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq , being a sovereign country , should also be fully respected .  
There is no doubt that economic recovery in the region has gathered considerable momentum .  Economic growth for most economies has been better than expected , external balances have improved remarkably , international funds have renewed interest in the region 's asset markets , and yield spreads of Asian sovereign bond issues over the US treasuries have narrowed notably .  
The Government noted today ( May 8 ) that the Standard &amp; amp ; Poor 's ( S &amp; amp ; P ) had affirmed its ratings ( sovereign foreign and local currency ratings at " A + " and " AA - " respectively ) and the stable outlook of Hong Kong SAR . .  " We are glad that S &amp; amp ; P has recognised Hong Kong 's autonomy in economic and monetary policies , which are proven effective and robust in the past years .  
The two sides reiterated their mutual support in safeguarding national unity , sovereign and territorial integrity , and advocate pushing forward the formation of a multi polar world on the basis of the United Nations Charter and existing principles of international laws  
The presence of foreign troops within the territories of sovereign States , in the name of protecting the social , cultural , ethnic , linguistic or religious rights of minorities , can not justify any effort to promote human rights .  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
It was intended to give an absolute and unchallengeable lead to these imperialistic forces for world domination by coercive forces and through blatant interference in internal affairs of independent and sovereign nations .  
With the Second World War barely over , the international community of that time sought to establish a world organization which would save succeeding generations from the scourge of war by instituting a system of collective security based on the repudiation of the use of force save in the common interest , and on the basic principles of sovereign equality , freedom , justice and the rule of law .  
In practice , however , the basic and universal principles of sovereignty and sovereign equality continue to be ignored or violated by reason of the unequal and undemocratic set-up of international relations and through impositions upon , and interference in , the internal affairs of other countries , for different reasons and with a variety of justifications .  
Moreover , this initiative fell within a favourable context of human dimension and a framework of values and hopes that were largely shared by sovereign States and Governments linked by their use of the French language , which greatly helped the Agency first to be recognized internationally and then to grow .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
This is the case of the economic , commercial and financial blockade that for more than 34 years has been imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba , in violation of the most fundamental norms of international law , of peaceful coexistence among sovereign and independent nations , and of freedom of trade and navigation .  
As has been pointed out on more than one occasion , the strengthening of the policy of continued economic aggression against Cuba through political pressure and various threats against sovereign Governments , which is being implemented at both the legislative and the governmental levels , in the well-known circumstances facing my country , is no mere accident , and my country has now abruptly lost more than 85 per cent of its traditional trade .  
The United Nations agencies involved in the entire range of processes covered under this omnibus goal should ensure that their activities are carried out in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular the sovereign equality and political independence of States , territorial integrity , and non-intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State .  
The desire expressed by the Members of the United Nations to enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council will become reality if we make the Council as representative an organ as possible , reflecting the universal character of the United Nations and including within it the greatest possible variety of interests and views , and if we adopt , as guiding principles to that end , those of the sovereign equality of States and of equitable geographical distribution , as provided in the Charter .  
As far as the United Nations is concerned , observing the principles of the sovereign equality of Member States and democracy in international relations in seeking common ground and following what is correct on the basis of mutual respect and through broad-based , active and constructive consultations represents a guarantee for formulating sound , comprehensive and correct policies .  
They pointed out that the responsibility of the United Nations in this matter should continue until the Palestinian people are able to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination , until an independent and sovereign State is established within its national territory and until the problem of refugees is settled in conformity with human rights instruments and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations .  
These would include creating and reviving national institutions , rebuilding and expanding the infrastructure , revitalizing the economy and creating and expanding social services , so that the Palestinian people may re-emerge as a proud , productive , independent , sovereign nation , with its own flag flying over all its territory , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif , and with full status as a Member State of the United Nations .  
New Zealand welcomes the strengthened commitment that coastal States and States fishing on the high seas have made reflected in the provisions of the Convention to improve the status of essential fisheries resources , both through agreed conservation measures for high-seas areas and through the exercise by coastal States of responsible management of the sovereign resources within their exclusive economic zones .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development [ 4 ] / is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
Now , 20 years later , almost 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus , a sovereign , independent , democratic State and a Member of the United Nations , remained under occupation , and gross and massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be committed there .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
These unconstitutional and illegal acts , which in essence , constituted political and legal aggression against a sovereign State , namely the Azerbaijani Republic , have never been repudiated by the Republic of Armenia , thus proving that Armenia should bear sole responsibility as the organizer and principal agent of the aggression against Azerbaijan . During this seven-year war , the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia have committed thousands of crimes in Azerbaijani territory .  
In order for the draft resolution to achieve the desired result and become an effective tool to rectify the situation , it is imperative not only to properly address the concerns of the issue at hand but also to maintain strict adherence to the basic principles governing relations between sovereign States . Indonesia is of the view that it is a meaningless exercise to adopt resolutions that are not implementable . 
The Court of Appeals vacated the District Court 's decision in this respect and held that the appropriate primary standard for determining damages in such a case was the cost reasonably to be incurred by the sovereign or its designated agency to restore or rehabilitate the environment in the affected area to its pre-existing condition , or as close thereto as is feasible without grossly disproportionate expenditures .  [ 15 ] / A / CN . 4 / 443 , paras . 41 to 51 .  
" The Argentine Government reiterates that it remains determined to resume exercising its sovereign rights through negotiations leading to a just and final solution of this territorial dispute and stresses that it proposes to continue moving ahead in the dialogue with the United Kingdom in order to build strong relationship of mutual trust and cooperation in the South-West Atlantic . 
Let us hope that this is the last time never again the world will watch these sad pictures , directed for us by those who for more than three years pulled the leg of very cooperative and acquiescent representatives of the international community by rejecting all initiatives for solving the crisis in Croatia and for the peaceful reintegration of Krajina into the sovereign and independent State of Croatia .  
In this connection , among the various aspects covered in the memorandum of understanding , one fact was underlined , namely , that it had been established that the restoration of sovereign organs involved the removal of all impediments to the normal functioning of State institutions , including the return of the assets of the respective organs .  
This action by the international community , showing itself to be unequivocally in favour of democratic law in Sao Tome and Principe and of scrupulous respect for democratically elected sovereign organs , represented not only an invaluable contribution to the positive conclusion of the crisis in Sao Tome and Principe , but also en example to be followed in all similar instances in any part of the world .  
Such normalization should be based on mutual and permanent respect for the real national interests of the two peoples and their States , dealing with issues by peaceful political means and laying the foundation for cooperation between two completely independent and sovereign States .  
Upon entry into force of this Interim Accord , the Party of the First Part recognizes the Party of the Second Part as an independent and sovereign State , under the provisional designation set forth in a letter of the Party of the First Part of the date of this Interim Accord , and the Parties shall at an early date establish diplomatic relations at an agreed level with the ultimate goal of relations at ambassadorial level .  
The threat posed to the internal security and stability of sovereign States , as well as to international security , by the dramatic increase of organized transnational crime in the past decade is growing and will continue to grow and become more menacing if concerted and decisive action on the part of the international community is delayed .  
The imposition of coercive economic measures ignores such principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States , and violates international legal instruments with the intent of forcibly imposing the political will of the sending State and subverting the political , economic and social regime of the target State .  
Where it is itself directly concerned , the Russian Federation is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and the freedom of international trade and navigation as mentioned in resolution 49 / 9 , and continues to support normal trade and economic relations with Cuba based on common interest and mutual benefit .  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ;  
The United States of America , continuing to ignore the views of specialized agencies and the readiness of Cuba to establish a serious exchange of information on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality of States and mutual respect , had not halted its illegal television and radio broadcasts directed against Cuba , openly violating the most basic norms of coexistence and international law .

Suspiciously enough , these events come together at one point : the passing by the United States Congress of the infamous piece of legislation aimed at definitively blockading Cuba from the rest of the world , when over 35 years of a cruel and ever-worsening economic , commercial and financial blockade have failed and has been condemned year after year by this sovereign Assembly .  
This makes us hopeful that the Assembly will be able to do so as a permanent part of its daily work , not having to deal with tragic events such as these , but in a healthy and natural way playing its role as the universal , supreme and sovereign organ of the United Nations .  
The strengthening of the role of the Organization , both in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the promotion of the fundamental objective of economic and social development , had to be logically dependent on the participation , on an equal footing , of all Member States which , whether big or small , were all equally sovereign and equally concerned with the destiny of the Organization .  
The world was presented with a shocking and unfamiliar picture of my country , erasing the efforts of the national community to turn its back on its past and wiping out the efforts of Central Africans to devote themselves , within the framework of their sovereign choice , to the search for the means of developing the Central African Republic , with its vast potential in mining , agriculture and livestock and with its abundant rainfall .  
Furthermore , Mexico reaffirms that , in strict accordance with the principles of international law governing relations among States , only Cuba , in the exercise of its inalienable rights , can determine as a free , sovereign and independent State its own political , social and economic system .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
Russia , firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of trade and international navigation , supports and intends to broaden normal economic and commercial ties with Cuba , based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage , and to put them into effect in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms .  
Almost five years ago , on 1 December 1991 , in a national referendum , the people of Ukraine confirmed its sovereign will and determination to build its own independent State with a predictable domestic and foreign policy to integrate our nation into the European family of free democracies .  
In both Declarations , the international community recognized that no State has the right to intervene , directly or indirectly , for any reason whatever , in the internal or external affairs of any other State , and that no State may use or encourage the use of economic , political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights or to secure from it advantages of any kind .  
The Declaration contained a clear conceptual framework for global action on the basis of the priorities upon which we all agreed : peace based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective regime of collective security ; development in all its aspects in the social and economic fields ; sovereign equality among States and respect for peoples ' rights ; and justice in addressing the various issues on the international agenda .  
In conclusion , since the Security Council has already decided that the UNCRO mandate in Croatia has ended effective 15 January , and thereby the United Nations mandate on the Prevlaka peninsula as well , and in view of the above-mentioned fact that the Prevlaka peninsula is an integral part of Croatia , the Croatian Government considers any and all requests designed and aimed at creating legal uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the status of parts of sovereign Croatian territory to be unacceptable , and contrary to the interest of peace and security in the region .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,

In the present instance , Cuba is requesting reopening of the item entitled " United Nations Decade of International Law " , in particular the consideration of respect for international law and its progressive development and codification , which today are under threat from unilateral interpretations by a super-Power which is seeking to impose its bilateral policy interest not only on the political action of the Organization but also on the legal thinking of the sovereign States Members of the international community .

The Governments recognized the sovereign right and legitimate interest of each country to safeguard its boundaries and to enforce its own immigration laws , always observing strict respect for the human rights of the migrants , as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and other relevant international instruments , irrespective of their nationality , race , age , religion , sex or immigration status . 
These violations are an irrefutable proof of the deliberate abuse , by a terrorist organization , of the rules of international civil aviation , whose harmonic development , compatible with the sovereignty and relations of respect and cooperation of sovereign States , is one of the principal objectives of the existence and the work of the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) . 
Noting that the Argentine Republic had always provided the necessary guarantees and safeguards in order to resolve the sovereign dispute , he expressed his conviction that there were sufficient bases for the establishment of a harmonious , lasting and beneficial relationship among all interested parties , both on the human and economic levels .  
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
Kazakstan calls on the parties to the conflict on all concerned States in the region and on the international community to take urgent measures to halt the military action , ensure non-interference in the internal affairs of the sovereign Islamic State of Afghanistan and guarantee its territorial integrity .  
The political leadership now has the opportunity to ensure that , in particular through the functioning of common institutions at the national level , all three communities can work towards the consolidation of a sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law , respect for the human rights of all peoples and the development of a representative democracy .  
The goal of the Peace Agreement has been commonly understood by the international community as being to restore peace and stability to Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign , unified country composed of two entities with unprecedented autonomy , united through common governing institutions resulting from free and fair elections .  
The legal status of the Caspian Sea must be based on the generally recognized rules and principles of international law and the international treaty practice of States situated on the shores of similar bodies of water and include the regulation of questions of navigation , the use of biological and mineral resources , the ecology , including changes in the sea level , etc . , and the definition of the jurisdictional limits of the littoral States on the basis of respect for their sovereign rights over their respective parts and sectors of the Caspian Sea .  
It is noteworthy that , while some Member States may have expressed reservations with respect to this or other provisions of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States on a variety of grounds , they have nonetheless expressed through the European Community 's statements and elsewhere their objection to the Helms-Burton legislation , so extreme and unjustified is its interference with their sovereign decision to maintain normal economic and commercial relations with Cuba .  
It is possible without unnecessary infringement of sovereign prerogatives of States to encourage indigenous non-governmental organizations , supported when necessary by independent and impartial international non-governmental organizations , to initiate timely action .  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
It is therefore the humble submission of my country that , based on the United Nations principles of the sovereign equality of all its Members , of universality of membership , and of equitable geographical representation , the South Pacific region , which includes the island nations along with Australia and New Zealand , should be recognized as a geopolitical region for the purpose of regional representation and membership of the Security Council .  
The majority of the Member States wanted the Organization to give effect to the principles that had prompted them to join the United Nations , as reaffirmed by the Heads of State at the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , namely international security and peace based on an effective system of collective security , on economic and social development , on justice and on the sovereign equality of States .  
The hiring of mercenaries to guarantee internal security and public order in African States could be regarded as a threat to the inalienable sovereign responsibility of States for their own internal order and security and to their responsibility to prevent the repression of their citizens or the violation of their human rights ; and the international community should examine the extent to which it considered the recruitment of mercenaries to be legal .  
Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population . 
On the other hand , the missile attached launched in retaliation by the United States in the southern region of the country causing substantial loss of life , an attack that had been condemned by the international community , constituted a violation of the inalienable right of the Kurdish people to express freely their will without foreign interference and was part of a deliberate campaign by the United States authorities aimed at bringing about the disintegration of the Iraqi State and undermining the national unity and territorial integrity of a sovereign State .  
He reiterated the principles relevant to peacekeeping which had been adopted at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries , held in Cartagena in 1995 , to the effect that peacekeeping operations should strictly adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , particularly the principles of respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , and should be based on the consent of the parties concerned and the principle of impartiality .  
That responsibility should continue until the Palestinian people exercises its inalienable right to self-determination , an independent and sovereign state is established in its national territory , and the problem of the refugees is settled pursuant to the relevant United Nations resolutions .  
Recommendations and decisions of ICSC or resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly concerning the conditions of service of common system staff were not automatically binding , for the following reasons : the organizations were in different financial and budgetary situations ; staff recruitment and retention difficulties varied ; and each common system organization was an independent and sovereign intergovernmental organization and should have the final word regarding the conditions of service of its staff .  
Viet Nam will continue its consistent policy of settling disputes through negotiation in the spirit of equality , mutual respect and understanding , with due respect to international law , particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , and to the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of coastal States over their respective continental shelves and exclusive economic zones .  
Within the original framework of the Charter , democracy was understood as essential to efforts to prevent future aggression , and to support the sovereign State as the basic guarantor of human rights , the basic mechanism for solving national problems and the basic element of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
Moreover , " international relations " - not relations among nations but relations among sovereign States - are increasingly shaped not only by the States themselves but also by an expanding array of non-State actors on the " international " scene , ranging all the way from individual persons to civic associations , non-governmental organizations , local authorities , private multinational business , academia , the media , parliamentarians and regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
We make this statement for the sake of the record of this institution , which was established for the attainment of the goals and ideals reflected in its Charter , maintains its neutrality , supports peoples ' will and is based on the principles of sovereign equality of all States , irrespective of their size , geographical location and military or economic potentialities .  
The Eighth Islamic Summit Conference , held in Tehran last week , inter alia , reaffirmed the commitment of the member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to preserve the legal continuity , unity , territorial integrity and sovereignty of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders and fully supported the establishment of a sovereign , democratic , multi-ethnic and multicultural State of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
These tasks are also dictated by the increase in the membership of the Organization , by the full application of the principles of sovereign equality and equitable geographical representation based on the Organization 's universal nature , and by the recognition that the United Nations remains a viable alternative for Member States .  
The statements and utterances credited to the two Thematic Rapporteurs were not only unfortunate , they were also capable of undermining the impartiality and integrity of these independent and neutral experts appointed by sovereign independent states in the Commission of Human Rights in which Nigeria is an active member .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , as well as others , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 15 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system . 
In this respect , they reaffirmed all 10 principles referred to in the Helsinki Final Act : sovereign equality ; respect for rights inherent in sovereignty ; refraining from the threat or use of force ; inviolability of frontiers ; territorial integrity of States ; peaceful settlement of disputes ; non-intervention in internal affairs ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief ; equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; cooperation among States ; and fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law .  
With its unique nature , its special mandate and its open-ended composition it could contribute greatly to the process of restructuring the Organization , giving an enhanced role to the General Assembly as the most representative body and increasing the representativeness of the Security Council by expanding the participation of developing countries , in conformity with the principle of sovereign equality as well as equitable geographical representation .  
That lack left the door open to different interpretations even of such generally recognized principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-discrimination , non-interference , negotiation in good faith , cooperation between States and the non-use of force , and experience showed how changing the agreed or implied rules of negotiation or backtracking on previous agreements complicated subsequent negotiations .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations , based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
We must be prepared to face other kinds of war : social war against poverty ; judicial war against organized crime ; political war against interventionism in our sovereign economies ; and moral war against the violation of human rights . 
While I would certainly acknowledge that some of the international community 's concern has been justified , I would like very much to say that the Republic of Belarus is a sovereign State that develops its own policy with due regard for the opportunities economic , social , moral and psychological of its citizens , within the limits of international patterns of behaviour and with respect for human rights and personal freedoms . 
And yet in my country , which today is in the grip of civil war , almost everything has been done since the sovereign national conference to spare our young democracy from the tragic upheavals inherent in any sudden social change , which in this case consisted of the move from a single-party political regime banning any organized opposition to a veritable explosion of freedoms individual , political and religious .  
My delegation wishes to emphasize that current realities of the post-cold-war era the diffusion of political , economic and military power among diverse regions of the world require that decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security be made in a more representative and democratic manner , mindful of the sovereign equality of all States .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
In conclusion , my delegation takes this opportunity to strongly reaffirm Malaysia 's well-known position of total commitment and unwavering support for , and abiding solidarity with , the Palestinian people in their valiant struggle for a just and lasting peace and for an independent sovereign state of Palestine , with Jerusalem , the sacred city of Muslims , Christians and Jews , as its capital . 
By enabling the Serbian ethnic community living in the region under the present United Nations Transitional Administration to set up and administer a unique zupanija within the sovereign Croatian State as a form of local self-government or administration or as any other form of organization of that level and meaning in future ;  
Further reaffirms that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
The High Contracting Parties shall base their relations with each other on the principles of mutual respect , sovereign equality , territorial integrity , the inviolability of borders , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of pressure , the right of peoples to control their own destiny , non-interference in internal affairs , observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , cooperation among States , and conscientious fulfilment of international obligations and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
The Presidents agree that the peoples of the Russian Federation and Ukraine shall continue to live and work in peace and harmony , supporting each other at a crucial stage in their history , when they are carrying out , in their independent sovereign States , large-scale reforms with a view to establishing a democratic society and a State based on rule of law , with a socially oriented market economy .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
Recently , both sides informed the Force Commander that , while they would continue to permit UNPREDEP to patrol on the basis of visible and key features of the terrain - including crossing the administrative border when topographical constraints made this a more convenient way of passing from one part of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to another - they retained their sovereign right to patrol their respective territories up to the old administrative border .  
The Government of China maintains that sovereign equality , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs and other norms governing international relations must be respected , and that each country is entitled to choose its own social system and mode of development in the light of its specific national conditions .  
The aforementioned Act , which seeks forcibly to stifle the Cuban social and economic system through the application of punitive measures against sovereign countries that have decided to maintain economic relations with Cuba , was adopted despite the outright rejection with which it was greeted by the international community from its inception as a bill , and particularly by the North American allies , owing to its extraterritorial and unilateral nature and the fact that it infringes the sovereignty of States and violates the principles of international law . 
The Government of Mexico , in full respect for the sovereignty of States and the right of self-determination of peoples , and the norms and principles which govern peaceful and friendly relations and cooperation among nations , believes that it is for the people of Cuba alone , in exercise of their inalienable rights , to continue to determine their own political , economic and social organization in a free , sovereign and independent manner .  
As far as the Russian Federation directly is concerned , it is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of international trade and navigation mentioned in the resolution and supports , and intends to continue to develop normal commercial and economic ties with Cuba based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage and put into practice in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms without any form of discrimination and on the basis of world prices .  
The Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation had held its first ministerial meeting in Mauritius in March 1997 and adopted its charter , the basic principles of which were respect for sovereign equality , territorial integrity and political independence , non-interference in internal affairs , peaceful coexistence and mutual advantage .  
The expert group confirmed that the basic principles of international law to be applied in assessing the legality of coercive economic measures are those of non-intervention and non-discrimination , based on such norms as the sovereignty and sovereign equality of States and the obligation to settle disputes by peaceful means .  
It was argued , moreover , that the text failed to embody important principles such as the sovereign right of States to exploit their own natural resources according to their own policies , the concept of common but differentiated responsibility and the international consensus on the right to development ; it was also considered unfortunate that none of the draft articles had been devoted specifically to the need for an overall balance between environmental and developmental imperatives .  
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
Unfortunately , owing to the obvious and open obstruction by some Contact Group members , our endeavour did not ultimately produce the desired effects , although the state delegation demonstrated great cooperativeness by demanding a minimum as regards the protection of the national interests , independence , territorial integrity and sovereignty of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . This country has done only what any other sovereign country in the world would have done . 
Tajikistan fully supports the Russian Federation 's constructive position on the Yugoslav problem and , as a country that has experienced the horrors of a civil war , believes that the events in Kosovo will give rise to yet another hotbed of tension , jeopardizing the international community 's efforts to implement international norms based on the principles of peaceful coexistence , non-use of force and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States . 
Ever since the Greek Cypriot side 's forceful usurpation of the legitimate seat of government in 1963 , the Greek Cypriot administration has been violating the Turkish Cypriot people 's vested rights of sovereign equality , partnership and fundamental freedoms through a campaign of ethnic cleansing during 1963-1974 and thereafter maintaining an inhuman embargo in all fields . 
It is imperative that the Security Council take urgent measures to condemn most strongly and to halt the NATO aggression against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , an independent , sovereign country and a founding Member State of the United Nations and to request the withdrawal of foreign forces built up by NATO at the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , threatening thereby to escalate the aggression .  
It is incomprehensible to request the withdrawal of the legitimate forces of a sovereign State from its own territory instead of calling for an urgent ending of foreign military aggression , killing of civilians and destruction of civilian targets .  
We would also like to know what measures the NATO members intend to take , and when , to stop and correct the overt , flagrant and continuing violation of the obligations they have undertaken , and how they plan to compensate for the economic and other damage to Yugoslavia and its citizens after the halting of military action against this sovereign member State of OSCE .  
At this time of grief and pain for the peoples of Yugoslavia , Cuba calls on the international community to mobilize its efforts to put an immediate end to this unjustified aggression and to prevent a further , even more regrettable loss of innocent lives , in order to allow this nation to resume the peaceful path of negotiating a solution to its internal problems , a matter solely and exclusively dependent on the sovereign will and self-determination of the Yugoslav peoples . 
Secondly , such a narrow definition of treaties and treaty-making would impede ( or even preclude ) any proper account of indigenous views on these issues , simply because of the widely _ held rationale that indigenous peoples are not States in the current sense of the term in international law , regardless of their generally recognized status as sovereign entities in the era of the Law of Nations .  
Furthermore , this motivation ( in the direct interest of the non-indigenous party ) was quite clear : to legitimize ( via the acquiescence of the autochthonous sovereign of the territories in question ) any right ( real or intended ) with which they could counter opposing claims advanced by other colonial powers vying for control of those lands .  
However , to legitimize beyond any doubt the ways and means used to take issues that originally belonged to the realm of international law away from it and to justify making them subject solely to domestic legislation unilaterally passed by the States and adjudicated by domestic non-indigenous courts , States should produce unassailable proof that the indigenous peoples in question have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes .  
There are abundant examples of this : the 1898 Joint Resolution under which the U.S . Congress , after using force to impose a treaty , consummated the outright annexation of the sovereign State of Hawaii ( which had manifold international juridical relations with other civilized nations ) , and the scramble for Africa formalized at the 1885 Berlin Congress by the colonial powers of the epoch are just two of the many examples .  
It is easy to see the negative effects for indigenous peoples of such a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors , not only on their initial sovereign condition , but also on their overall international juridical status .  
It is important to recall that modern non-indigenous law long ago dispelled the theory which advocated that the absence of formal legal / political recognition by one sovereign entity ( or a group of them ) could determine either the existence or the juridical international status of another .  
recommendations included in the ICPD Programme of Action , and those included in the document to be issued at the end of this session , is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and developmental priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with relevant and universally recognized covenants and agreements . 
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  6 .  The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
The view was expressed that the decision on ratification as well as on rationalization and adaptation of the human rights machinery at the national level was the prerogative of individual sovereign countries rather than an initiative taken by the departments concerned .  
In accordance with the international standards , " a substantial autonomy " implies that some specific powers and rights , such as the right to the use of language , education and information in one 's own tongue , protection and fostering of one 's own culture and tradition as well as local administration affairs , are transferred to the autonomous region , which takes place within the framework of a broader constitutional and legal order in a sovereign State .  
Under international standards " substantial autonomy " implies that some specific competencies and rights , such as the right of minorities to use and receive education and information in their own language , as well as the right to protect and foster individual culture and tradition and the affairs concerning the local administration , are transferred to the field of autonomy within the wider constitutional and legal order of a sovereign State . 
From my perspective the basic premise upon which the CD is established is the conviction that measures to promote and achieve non _ proliferation , arms control and disarmament are vital dimensions of a complex and comprehensive effort to enhance international security between sovereign States and to secure human security for all . 
The policies and laws of economic , commercial and financial blockade and embargo of the United States of America imposed on the Republic of Cuba in the last decades violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and run counter to the common trends of our world today , namely cooperation for development on the basis of equality amongst sovereign States and non-discrimination of political systems .  
We are sure that , given your skilful and widely recognized abilities and leadership , our deliberations will reach a positive conclusion that will be highly beneficial to the international community , and particularly to the nations deprived of free and sovereign access to the sea .  
The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the immutable values of peace , democracy and the rule of law , of human rights , development and social justice , and bearing in mind the sovereign equality of States , the non-interference in their internal affairs and the respect for their territorial integrity .  
The construction is telling proof that the United States Government cares little about the political solution of the situation in Kosovo and Metohija , and that its main concern is to occupy part of the sovereign territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and establish a long-term presence in the autonomous province of its constituent Republic of Serbia under the guise of participating in the United Nations security presence .  
Despite numerous obstacles , the process of implementing the settlement plan and the Houston agreements was back on track after five rounds of direct negotiations between Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Hamra y de Rio de Oro ( POLISARIO ) yielding to the irreversible course of history and the general belief that the conflict could be resolved by the only worthy means , on the basis of the free and sovereign expression of its will by the Saharan people . 
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Although , as reiterated in the Security Council resolutions , all acts of the Abkhaz separatists contravening the sovereign rights of Georgia are null and void , due consideration has to be given to the fact that they have established a consistent pattern of behaviour , directed against attempts to intensify international efforts to diffuse tensions and to secure positive developments in implementing confidence-building measures . 
In 1998 , the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity had recommended that member States should adopt a draft model legislation on access to biological resources at national level ; initiate a process of negotiation among African countries to adopt an African convention on biological diversity ; and develop a common position to safeguard their sovereign rights and the vital interests of local communities .  
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments made by private sector agencies be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
The Russian Federation has repeatedly stated in a number of international forums that it rejects the growing trend towards unilateral extraterritorial application of national laws and measures affecting other States ' trade and foreign relations , since these laws and measures breach international law , violate the principles of the sovereign equality of States and respect for national sovereignty , and undermine peaceful coexistence .  
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Emphasizes that it is important for sovereign risk assessments made by private sector agencies to be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
In a sense , our endeavour to define and , indeed , to promote human security has philosophical and practical implications both positive and negative for us as sovereign States and for the United Nations as the leading global multilateral Organization .  
Hence , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the values of peace , democracy , rule of law , human rights , development and social justice , bearing in mind the principles of sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for their territorial integrity .  
In this regard , the United States believes that there are still substantial issues on which there must be consensus before a draft convention can be considered for adoption , in particular the extent of coastal-State jurisdiction over underwater cultural heritage in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf seaward of 24 nautical miles , and the treatment of vessels and aircraft entitled to sovereign immunity .  
We are confident that a sovereign State of Palestine , with East Jerusalem as its capital and the State of Israel will find an acceptable solution under international guarantees to preserve the political , humanitarian and religious dimensions of the city of Al-Quds , the key to peace .  
Nonetheless , it is also natural , in a democratic international community based on the principles of equitable geographic representation and the sovereign equality of States , that changes to the collective security system be the result of a genuine general agreement , instead of being imposed .  
The Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held at Durban in September 1998 stressed that the expansion and reform of the Security Council must be an indivisible part of a common and complementary process that takes into account the principles of sovereign equality among States and equitable geographic distribution , as well as the need for transparency , accountability and democracy in the working methods of the Security Council , including decision-making therein .  
In Europe the only military bloc left over from the cold war , under its new strategic concept , bypassed the United Nations Security Council and bombed , with the worlds most powerful and sophisticated military machinery , a weak sovereign State , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , turning the Balkan region , which has experienced so much misery in this century , into a testing ground for its new strategy .  
And all those conferences aimed to reach that goal through an organized , yet voluntary effort : a collective effort on a global scale ; an effort by sovereign States and civil society working together ; an effort guided by a common approach based on universal values and principles which we all could accept.So Cairo was not just a population conference .  
For several months the world witnessed a war in the Balkans a region of the world that , in economic terms , is relatively prosperous in which the vital social infrastructure and human potential of a sovereign State were deliberately destroyed .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  
If the Government of a State were to distribute letters in which an ethnic or minority group alleged that it was the victim of repressive measures or that its fundamental human rights were not recognized in the sovereign territory of another State , the Government of Cyprus reserved the right to act in the same way if that practice continued .  
While supporting the principle that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights lay with States , his delegation wished to underline in that regard that initiatives aimed at undermining the territorial integrity or political unity of independent and sovereign States must not be encouraged .  
Its composition and its relations with sovereign States and the United Nations would need the most careful consideration , in order to ensure that the Court would be permanent , effective , independent , efficient , credible and trustworthy .  
Secondly , we are somewhat concerned that the reference at the end of the fourth preambular paragraph to human rights and fundamental freedoms could be misconstrued by certain quarters in order to promote objectives which are in fact contrary to the stated objectives of this draft resolution and to promote interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States .  
As indicated in the communiqu of the SADC Summit meeting on the Democratic Republic of the Congo held on 23 August 1998 , the reconstruction of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as an independent , sovereign , united , peaceful , stable and prosperous country is critical to the achievement of the same objectives in the region and in the rest of the African continent .  
He noted that the recent upsurge in transnational crime had resulted in the penetration of central Asia by criminal groups and that the development of effective legislative frameworks and legal mechanisms for fighting crime had become a priority of the new sovereign States in that area .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights . 6 . The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
The two sides maintain that international terrorism , religious extremism and national separatism in all its forms , as well as transnational criminal activities ( such as illicit trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs and psychotropic and explosive substances , and economic offences ) have now become serious threats to the security of sovereign States and to international peace and security .  
Every State had a sovereign right to enact national legislation that reflected the cultural values and imperatives of the society concerned , ensuring the security and safety of individuals in accordance with internationally agreed principles relating to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Being an integral part of Europe , Bulgaria regards accelerated accession to the European Union and full membership in North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) as an expression of our sovereign political choice based on broad public support .  
The international community must continue to provide unswerving support to a sovereign , united , multiethnic , multicultural and prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina , at peace with itself and contributing to international peace and security .  
A deliberate action calculated to step up ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Serbs and other nonAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija , it is a means of imposing neocolonialist control over the natural , material and human resources of a sovereign country .  
Expansion of the membership must be responsive to the changed global political and economic climate , reflecting the new realities in the global arena and respecting the principles of sovereign equality among all States and equitable geographical distribution .  
All this is accompanied by the establishment of illegal armed formations , blatant interference from abroad in the affairs of sovereign States and the creation of new hotbeds of tension , leading increasingly to the largescale loss of innocent lives .  
It is essential that the truth be told to the international community of the tragedy at Racak ; that the practice of issuing sealed warrants be abandoned ; and that the secret 1996 memorandum between the ICTY and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) sanctioning the hunting down of indictees that has often led to the murder and death of suspects , in violation of the borders of sovereign States be published .  
We also express , together with all other Arab States , our concern that Somalia become again a united , fully sovereign and independent State able to defend the vital interests of the Somali people , following the attempts by evil forces external and internal to tear apart the social and political fabric of its society and destroy its economic infrastructure .  
In conclusion , as East Timor grows into a full-fledged sovereign and independent nation , the international community has a solemn responsibility to support measures including building bridges of understanding towards achieving reconciliation , strengthening the foundations of government based on democratic and transparent practices , and promoting capacity-building programmes .  
The Court should not be subject to political pressure ; rather , it must be a respectable , credible institution that would prevent certain States from committing regrettable acts such as allowing their judicial officers to recklessly prosecute the political leaders of other sovereign , independent States with whose policies they disagreed ; it should also put a final end to State terrorism of the type currently engaged in by Rwandans , Ugandans and Burundians against his country . 
Within this context , and also in light of growing interdependence in an era of globalization , some delegations emphasized that developing and developed countries shared responsibilities in realizing rights and should fulfil their duties in a manner that promoted equitable development based on sovereign equality , mutual interest and cooperation .  
As it condemns these acts of aggression against Iraqi targets and installations , the Government of Iraq urges you to perform your assigned duties as they relate to the maintenance of international peace and security by intervening with the governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt , end and desist from any resumption of their constant and unwarranted aggression against an independent , sovereign State . 
The development of a comprehensive convention on international space law with due regard for the sovereign rights of States could help to resolve such difficult issues as the delimitation and definition of outer space , control of space pollution , management of scientific research and commercial activities in outer space , registration of space objects , protection of intellectual property , responsibility and the settlement of disputes .  
As it condemns these acts of aggression against Iraqi targets and installations , the Government of Iraq urges you to perform the duties assigned to you under the Charter as they relate to the maintenance of international peace and security by intervening with the Governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt , end and desist from any resumption of their constant and unwarranted aggression against an independent , sovereign State .

As it condemns these acts of aggression against Iraqi targets and installations , the Government of Iraq urges you to perform the duties assigned to you [ under the Charter ] as they relate to the maintenance of international peace and security by intervening with the governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt , end and desist from any resumption of their constant and unwarranted aggression against an independent , sovereign State .  
As it condemns these acts of aggression against Iraqi targets and installations , the Government of Iraq urges you to perform the duties assigned to you [ under the Charter ] as they relate to the maintenance of international peace and security by intervening with the governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt , end and desist from any resumption of their constant and unwarranted aggression against an independent , sovereign State .  
These are the precise considerations that led to Russias initiative to convene a Balkan summit , with a view to the conclusion , by the States of the region and interested neighbouring countries , of a legally binding agreement that would set out mutual obligations for absolute compliance with the fundamental principles of State relations , the most important of which are the inviolability of borders , sovereign equality , respect for territorial integrity , non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States and the non-use of force . 
As it condemns these acts of aggression against Iraqi targets and installations , the Government of Iraq urges you to perform the duties assigned to you [ under the Charter ] as they relate to the maintenance of international peace and security by intervening with the governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt , end and desist from any resumption of their constant and unwarranted aggression against an independent , sovereign State .  
The application of such laws , which are intended to restrict the access of the targeted sovereign States and Members of the United Nations to markets , capital , technology and investment in order to exert pressure upon them to change their political and economic orientation is a flagrant violation of the principles of international law , the Charter of the United Nations and numerous other resolutions of the General Assembly .  
But we are prepared for cooperation as sovereign equals , in accordance with the new realities of a world where the principal national objectives of States can be achieved through economic and political cooperation , rather than military conquest or regional or global domination .  
He also severely denounced some countries for putting regional organizations above the UN Security Council or even bypassing the UN Security Council to carry out military intervention in a sovereign country , pointing out that such practice has " severely damaged the existing international collective security mechanism , and the consequences are extremely dangerous . "  
The two countries ' foreign ministers called for the unconditional respect for the right of the people of all countries to choose social systems , value concepts , and ways of development in line with their countries ' conditions .  They considered the interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries on humanitarian grounds and in the name of protecting human rights constitute acts that violate the purpose and principle of the United Nations Charter .  
What is worthy of attention is that because the proposition on " Taiwan independence " has never been accepted by the majority of the Taiwan people , those who have adhered to " Taiwan independence , " have , out of current political needs , asserted that " Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country , " and Taiwan has never been recognized as a part of China 's territory .  
Sun Yuxi answered that last year , the US-led NATO used force against Yugoslavia , a sovereign country , using the Kosovo issue as an excuse .  This seriously violated the UN Charter and norms governing international relations and set an extremely dangerous precedent of armed intervention in the internal affairs of another country .  
In 1999 , the US-led NATO disregarded the norm of International Law and bypassed the UNSC and frenziedly bombed a sovereign state-the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for as long as 78 days , causing the biggest humanitarian disaster in Europe since the World War II , killed more than 2,000 innocent civilians , and wounded more than 6,000 people .  Some one-million people lost their homes and more than two-million people lost their sources of income .  The direct economic losses reached $ 600-billion yuan .  
All countries should have the right to act in line with their native national conditions to choose their respective political systems and development models .  No nation or group of states has the right to force its values and social system onto others , even less so to exploit the human rights matter or a so-called " humanitarian crisis " as an excuse to deliberately interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country .  
It is necessary to reiterate time and again and earnestly put into practice the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , persistent peaceful settlement of international disputes , sovereign equality of all countries , respect for the national conditions of countries , seeking common ground while shelving differences , and the principle of closer mutually-beneficial cooperation for common development .  All these principles should be observed by each and every country .  
This kind of " international interference " can only be applicable within the commonwealth of sovereign states basically sharing similar political systems , legal standards , and value concepts and reaching a common view on human rights .  
Thus , we must continue to enhance our national defense strength , and tempered a sharp and powerful " sword " of justice for safeguarding the sovereign and territorial integrity of socialist China and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation .  
In the 1999 Kosovo war , the United States further turned " humanitarian assistance " into a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state , raising the " non-war military operation " to a strategic level .  
After causing the incident , the US plane intruded into China 's territory and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , which further violated relevant provisions of international laws and Chinese laws , thereby constituting a violation of China 's sovereign right and territorial air space .  
Jiang Zemin said : " China and Chile are separated by vast oceans .  However , the common goal of safeguarding world peace , protecting sovereign rights , developing the national economy , and improving the people 's life has tightlyunited us . "  
To exercise sovereign right and exclusive jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone , the coastal state is entitled to draw up relevant laws and rules to restrict the overflight freedom enjoyed by another state 's aircraft in the airspace over the exclusive economic zone .  Doing so , the coastal state can safeguard the aerial traffic order and flight safety in the zone and protect its legal rights and interest .  
China 's military plane tailed after and conducted surveillance over the US military reconnaissance plane , which intruded into the airspace of our coastal exclusive economic zone to conduct military reconnaissance activities , according to the international law and China 's law .  Exercising sovereign right in the exclusive economic zone , and safeguarding the national defense security is just and legal behavior .  
Jiang Zemin said : China upholds an independent foreign policy of peace .  Its basic objective is one of safeguarding the country 's sovereign independence , territorial integrity , and national dignity , as well as one of opposing hegemonism , safeguarding world peace , promoting common development , and building an international environment of long-term peace and stability for China 's reforms , opening up and modernization drive .  
First they were confusing right and wrong , taking bites and demanding that China release the crew and the airplane .  Moreover , they absurdly claimed that the forced landing of the American spy plane at the Hainan Island airport was " US territory , " and that the United States had " sovereign exemption , " and China was not permitted to board the aircraft for inspection .  They completely disregarded the fact that the Chinese fighter plane had crashed and the pilot was lost , causing a tragedy for fellow Chinese officials and a Chinese household .  
In order to legalize this rude and unreasonable demand , the US side even made up the absurd argument that the US military plane causing the incident was a part of its territory and US state property and therefore , was eligible for sovereign immunity .  
A Recount of the Foreign Relations Act of the United States ( third edition ) , the most authoritative international law document of the United States , even says the agreement of the accepting state alone is not enough .  On the basis of such an agreement , the accepting state and the foreign country must also reach a special agreement on relevant community before the foreign military forces are eligible for sovereign immunity in the accepting state .  
As a result , the DPP government under Chen Shui-bian has the " multi-party coalition government " , and if there are contradictions among the various party factions on the one China or " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent nation " , no choice can be made , and no unified consensus can be formed .  So the enlightened coalition government trick will in the final analysis be only a struggle of private interests .  
In that period , China just witnessed the feudal dynasty 's surrendering of the nation 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the imperialist foreign powers ' despotic and domineering practice on its land , unceasing social turbulences , and the people 's miserable lives of suffering from hunger and cold . 
In the first 80-year period , the feudal rulers surrendered the country 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the whole society was thrown into utter chaos caused by wars , the country became impoverished and weak and the people lived in hunger and cold .  
The two countries hold that the challenges of the 21st century can only be overcome by abiding by the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and the acknowledged norms of international law , and taking into consideration the national characteristics and features of the people of all countries , and through the collective efforts of the international community , The two countries state that they will absolutely not accept any conspiracy for violating the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign states under any pretext . 
So far the Taiwan authorities have not yet renounced its separatistic position that " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent state , " have refused to accept the one-China principle , negated the " 1992 common understanding " and the goal of cross-strait reunification , and continued to carry out separatistic activities internationally ; they have further purchased advanced weapons , attempted to extend their influence by relying on foreigners and to refuse reunification by force .  This is why the root causes of tensions between the two sides of the strait still exist .  
In the first 80-year period , the feudal lords surrendered the country 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the whole society was thrown into utter chaos caused by wars , the country became impoverished and weak and the people lived in hunger and cold .  
By using force against the sovereign state of Yugoslavia , US-led NATO had not only seriously violated the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law and set an extremely dangerous example of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries , but had also further complicated the situation in the region .  
A spokesman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Dang said in Beijing today : When interviewed by a Hong Kong media unit a few days ago , Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] brazenly stuck to the stance of " Taiwan being a sovereign state " and argued that the two sides of the strait are two states of the Chinese based on the so-called " remote relative and close neighbor " theory .  Hence , she flagrantly challenged the one-China principle .  
In the " exclusive interview , " not only did Annette Lu manifest her die-hard " Taiwan independence " stance and plot of splittism , she also adopted a very contemptible means .  She used the Taiwan people as a " bargaining chip , " wantonly distorted facts and the Taiwan people 's desire , and created a false impression that Taiwan " is already a country of sovereign independence " in a vain attempt to create an excuse to " justify splittism . "  This fully displays the cunning side of her nature .  
Even though they do their utmost to play crafty tricks , saying that the two sides of the strait are two states and saying in another way round that the two sides of the strait can form a confederation or a compound state in the form of two sovereign states , this argument is not tenable in terms of legal principle and will not be recognized by the international community .

Xu Fangming listed the following facts to prove that China has no problem in repaying her sovereign foreign debts : Over the past 20 years since reform and opening up , China 's economy has developed by leaps and bounds , which has resulted in sustained , healthy , and stable national economic growth .  
While re-stressing the standpoints and viewpoints of the Chinese side , Chairman Li Peng emphasized that on the basis of safeguarding the basic norms of international relations China respects the independence , sovereignty , and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan , support the relevant resolutions of the United Nations regarding the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh and does not recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as a sovereign state nor the so-called " parliamentary election " held in this area .  
Third , the two countries shared common historical experiences .  China and Burma have constantly shown sympathy for and supported each other in their efforts for independence and liberation , safeguarding of national independence and sovereign and territorial integrity , and national construction .  Common national fates have closely linked the two countries together .  
In fact , since taking office Chen Shuibian has never acknowledged the " one China " principle ; he has repeatedly said that " Taiwan is a sovereign independent state , " blocked cross-strait political contacts and negotiations , and glibly talked about a " decisive battle offshore , " in a bid to reject reunification by using armed force ; and all this is related to the continual wrong signals being given by the United States .  
Making no mention whatsoever about the Taiwan authorities ' defeat in their internal struggles with the Mainland for the ruling power in China and in the external struggles for China 's representation , he simply characterizes the two sides of the strait as two independent sovereign countries since Taiwan was separated from the Mainland in 1949 .  
As the most representative and most authoritative international organization of sovereign states , the United Nations has played an irreplaceable role in maintaining world peace , promoting common development , and in establishing a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
In answering a question raised by a reporter at a news briefing held by the Foreign Ministry here today , Zhang Qiyue said relevant resolutions on Iraq adopted by the Security Council should be comprehensively and earnestly implemented , while the independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq , being a sovereign country , should also be fully respected .  
There is no doubt that economic recovery in the region has gathered considerable momentum .  Economic growth for most economies has been better than expected , external balances have improved remarkably , international funds have renewed interest in the region 's asset markets , and yield spreads of Asian sovereign bond issues over the US treasuries have narrowed notably .  
The Government noted today ( May 8 ) that the Standard &amp; amp ; Poor 's ( S &amp; amp ; P ) had affirmed its ratings ( sovereign foreign and local currency ratings at " A + " and " AA - " respectively ) and the stable outlook of Hong Kong SAR . .  " We are glad that S &amp; amp ; P has recognised Hong Kong 's autonomy in economic and monetary policies , which are proven effective and robust in the past years .  
The two sides reiterated their mutual support in safeguarding national unity , sovereign and territorial integrity , and advocate pushing forward the formation of a multi polar world on the basis of the United Nations Charter and existing principles of international laws  
The presence of foreign troops within the territories of sovereign States , in the name of protecting the social , cultural , ethnic , linguistic or religious rights of minorities , can not justify any effort to promote human rights .  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
It was intended to give an absolute and unchallengeable lead to these imperialistic forces for world domination by coercive forces and through blatant interference in internal affairs of independent and sovereign nations .  
With the Second World War barely over , the international community of that time sought to establish a world organization which would save succeeding generations from the scourge of war by instituting a system of collective security based on the repudiation of the use of force save in the common interest , and on the basic principles of sovereign equality , freedom , justice and the rule of law .  
In practice , however , the basic and universal principles of sovereignty and sovereign equality continue to be ignored or violated by reason of the unequal and undemocratic set-up of international relations and through impositions upon , and interference in , the internal affairs of other countries , for different reasons and with a variety of justifications .  
Moreover , this initiative fell within a favourable context of human dimension and a framework of values and hopes that were largely shared by sovereign States and Governments linked by their use of the French language , which greatly helped the Agency first to be recognized internationally and then to grow .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
This is the case of the economic , commercial and financial blockade that for more than 34 years has been imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba , in violation of the most fundamental norms of international law , of peaceful coexistence among sovereign and independent nations , and of freedom of trade and navigation .  
As has been pointed out on more than one occasion , the strengthening of the policy of continued economic aggression against Cuba through political pressure and various threats against sovereign Governments , which is being implemented at both the legislative and the governmental levels , in the well-known circumstances facing my country , is no mere accident , and my country has now abruptly lost more than 85 per cent of its traditional trade .  
The United Nations agencies involved in the entire range of processes covered under this omnibus goal should ensure that their activities are carried out in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular the sovereign equality and political independence of States , territorial integrity , and non-intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State .  
The desire expressed by the Members of the United Nations to enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council will become reality if we make the Council as representative an organ as possible , reflecting the universal character of the United Nations and including within it the greatest possible variety of interests and views , and if we adopt , as guiding principles to that end , those of the sovereign equality of States and of equitable geographical distribution , as provided in the Charter .  
As far as the United Nations is concerned , observing the principles of the sovereign equality of Member States and democracy in international relations in seeking common ground and following what is correct on the basis of mutual respect and through broad-based , active and constructive consultations represents a guarantee for formulating sound , comprehensive and correct policies .  
They pointed out that the responsibility of the United Nations in this matter should continue until the Palestinian people are able to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination , until an independent and sovereign State is established within its national territory and until the problem of refugees is settled in conformity with human rights instruments and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations .  
These would include creating and reviving national institutions , rebuilding and expanding the infrastructure , revitalizing the economy and creating and expanding social services , so that the Palestinian people may re-emerge as a proud , productive , independent , sovereign nation , with its own flag flying over all its territory , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif , and with full status as a Member State of the United Nations .  
New Zealand welcomes the strengthened commitment that coastal States and States fishing on the high seas have made reflected in the provisions of the Convention to improve the status of essential fisheries resources , both through agreed conservation measures for high-seas areas and through the exercise by coastal States of responsible management of the sovereign resources within their exclusive economic zones .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development [ 4 ] / is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
Now , 20 years later , almost 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus , a sovereign , independent , democratic State and a Member of the United Nations , remained under occupation , and gross and massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be committed there .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
These unconstitutional and illegal acts , which in essence , constituted political and legal aggression against a sovereign State , namely the Azerbaijani Republic , have never been repudiated by the Republic of Armenia , thus proving that Armenia should bear sole responsibility as the organizer and principal agent of the aggression against Azerbaijan . During this seven-year war , the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia have committed thousands of crimes in Azerbaijani territory .  
In order for the draft resolution to achieve the desired result and become an effective tool to rectify the situation , it is imperative not only to properly address the concerns of the issue at hand but also to maintain strict adherence to the basic principles governing relations between sovereign States . Indonesia is of the view that it is a meaningless exercise to adopt resolutions that are not implementable . 
The Court of Appeals vacated the District Court 's decision in this respect and held that the appropriate primary standard for determining damages in such a case was the cost reasonably to be incurred by the sovereign or its designated agency to restore or rehabilitate the environment in the affected area to its pre-existing condition , or as close thereto as is feasible without grossly disproportionate expenditures .  [ 15 ] / A / CN . 4 / 443 , paras . 41 to 51 .  
" The Argentine Government reiterates that it remains determined to resume exercising its sovereign rights through negotiations leading to a just and final solution of this territorial dispute and stresses that it proposes to continue moving ahead in the dialogue with the United Kingdom in order to build strong relationship of mutual trust and cooperation in the South-West Atlantic . 
Let us hope that this is the last time never again the world will watch these sad pictures , directed for us by those who for more than three years pulled the leg of very cooperative and acquiescent representatives of the international community by rejecting all initiatives for solving the crisis in Croatia and for the peaceful reintegration of Krajina into the sovereign and independent State of Croatia .  
In this connection , among the various aspects covered in the memorandum of understanding , one fact was underlined , namely , that it had been established that the restoration of sovereign organs involved the removal of all impediments to the normal functioning of State institutions , including the return of the assets of the respective organs .  
This action by the international community , showing itself to be unequivocally in favour of democratic law in Sao Tome and Principe and of scrupulous respect for democratically elected sovereign organs , represented not only an invaluable contribution to the positive conclusion of the crisis in Sao Tome and Principe , but also en example to be followed in all similar instances in any part of the world .  
Such normalization should be based on mutual and permanent respect for the real national interests of the two peoples and their States , dealing with issues by peaceful political means and laying the foundation for cooperation between two completely independent and sovereign States .  
Upon entry into force of this Interim Accord , the Party of the First Part recognizes the Party of the Second Part as an independent and sovereign State , under the provisional designation set forth in a letter of the Party of the First Part of the date of this Interim Accord , and the Parties shall at an early date establish diplomatic relations at an agreed level with the ultimate goal of relations at ambassadorial level .  
The threat posed to the internal security and stability of sovereign States , as well as to international security , by the dramatic increase of organized transnational crime in the past decade is growing and will continue to grow and become more menacing if concerted and decisive action on the part of the international community is delayed .  
The imposition of coercive economic measures ignores such principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States , and violates international legal instruments with the intent of forcibly imposing the political will of the sending State and subverting the political , economic and social regime of the target State .  
Where it is itself directly concerned , the Russian Federation is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and the freedom of international trade and navigation as mentioned in resolution 49 / 9 , and continues to support normal trade and economic relations with Cuba based on common interest and mutual benefit .  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ;  
The United States of America , continuing to ignore the views of specialized agencies and the readiness of Cuba to establish a serious exchange of information on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality of States and mutual respect , had not halted its illegal television and radio broadcasts directed against Cuba , openly violating the most basic norms of coexistence and international law .

Suspiciously enough , these events come together at one point : the passing by the United States Congress of the infamous piece of legislation aimed at definitively blockading Cuba from the rest of the world , when over 35 years of a cruel and ever-worsening economic , commercial and financial blockade have failed and has been condemned year after year by this sovereign Assembly .  
This makes us hopeful that the Assembly will be able to do so as a permanent part of its daily work , not having to deal with tragic events such as these , but in a healthy and natural way playing its role as the universal , supreme and sovereign organ of the United Nations .  
The strengthening of the role of the Organization , both in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the promotion of the fundamental objective of economic and social development , had to be logically dependent on the participation , on an equal footing , of all Member States which , whether big or small , were all equally sovereign and equally concerned with the destiny of the Organization .  
The world was presented with a shocking and unfamiliar picture of my country , erasing the efforts of the national community to turn its back on its past and wiping out the efforts of Central Africans to devote themselves , within the framework of their sovereign choice , to the search for the means of developing the Central African Republic , with its vast potential in mining , agriculture and livestock and with its abundant rainfall .  
Furthermore , Mexico reaffirms that , in strict accordance with the principles of international law governing relations among States , only Cuba , in the exercise of its inalienable rights , can determine as a free , sovereign and independent State its own political , social and economic system .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
Russia , firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of trade and international navigation , supports and intends to broaden normal economic and commercial ties with Cuba , based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage , and to put them into effect in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms .  
Almost five years ago , on 1 December 1991 , in a national referendum , the people of Ukraine confirmed its sovereign will and determination to build its own independent State with a predictable domestic and foreign policy to integrate our nation into the European family of free democracies .  
In both Declarations , the international community recognized that no State has the right to intervene , directly or indirectly , for any reason whatever , in the internal or external affairs of any other State , and that no State may use or encourage the use of economic , political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights or to secure from it advantages of any kind .  
The Declaration contained a clear conceptual framework for global action on the basis of the priorities upon which we all agreed : peace based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective regime of collective security ; development in all its aspects in the social and economic fields ; sovereign equality among States and respect for peoples ' rights ; and justice in addressing the various issues on the international agenda .  
In conclusion , since the Security Council has already decided that the UNCRO mandate in Croatia has ended effective 15 January , and thereby the United Nations mandate on the Prevlaka peninsula as well , and in view of the above-mentioned fact that the Prevlaka peninsula is an integral part of Croatia , the Croatian Government considers any and all requests designed and aimed at creating legal uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the status of parts of sovereign Croatian territory to be unacceptable , and contrary to the interest of peace and security in the region .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,

In the present instance , Cuba is requesting reopening of the item entitled " United Nations Decade of International Law " , in particular the consideration of respect for international law and its progressive development and codification , which today are under threat from unilateral interpretations by a super-Power which is seeking to impose its bilateral policy interest not only on the political action of the Organization but also on the legal thinking of the sovereign States Members of the international community .

The Governments recognized the sovereign right and legitimate interest of each country to safeguard its boundaries and to enforce its own immigration laws , always observing strict respect for the human rights of the migrants , as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and other relevant international instruments , irrespective of their nationality , race , age , religion , sex or immigration status . 
These violations are an irrefutable proof of the deliberate abuse , by a terrorist organization , of the rules of international civil aviation , whose harmonic development , compatible with the sovereignty and relations of respect and cooperation of sovereign States , is one of the principal objectives of the existence and the work of the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) . 
Noting that the Argentine Republic had always provided the necessary guarantees and safeguards in order to resolve the sovereign dispute , he expressed his conviction that there were sufficient bases for the establishment of a harmonious , lasting and beneficial relationship among all interested parties , both on the human and economic levels .  
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
Kazakstan calls on the parties to the conflict on all concerned States in the region and on the international community to take urgent measures to halt the military action , ensure non-interference in the internal affairs of the sovereign Islamic State of Afghanistan and guarantee its territorial integrity .  
The political leadership now has the opportunity to ensure that , in particular through the functioning of common institutions at the national level , all three communities can work towards the consolidation of a sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law , respect for the human rights of all peoples and the development of a representative democracy .  
The goal of the Peace Agreement has been commonly understood by the international community as being to restore peace and stability to Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign , unified country composed of two entities with unprecedented autonomy , united through common governing institutions resulting from free and fair elections .  
The legal status of the Caspian Sea must be based on the generally recognized rules and principles of international law and the international treaty practice of States situated on the shores of similar bodies of water and include the regulation of questions of navigation , the use of biological and mineral resources , the ecology , including changes in the sea level , etc . , and the definition of the jurisdictional limits of the littoral States on the basis of respect for their sovereign rights over their respective parts and sectors of the Caspian Sea .  
It is noteworthy that , while some Member States may have expressed reservations with respect to this or other provisions of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States on a variety of grounds , they have nonetheless expressed through the European Community 's statements and elsewhere their objection to the Helms-Burton legislation , so extreme and unjustified is its interference with their sovereign decision to maintain normal economic and commercial relations with Cuba .  
It is possible without unnecessary infringement of sovereign prerogatives of States to encourage indigenous non-governmental organizations , supported when necessary by independent and impartial international non-governmental organizations , to initiate timely action .  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
It is therefore the humble submission of my country that , based on the United Nations principles of the sovereign equality of all its Members , of universality of membership , and of equitable geographical representation , the South Pacific region , which includes the island nations along with Australia and New Zealand , should be recognized as a geopolitical region for the purpose of regional representation and membership of the Security Council .  
The majority of the Member States wanted the Organization to give effect to the principles that had prompted them to join the United Nations , as reaffirmed by the Heads of State at the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , namely international security and peace based on an effective system of collective security , on economic and social development , on justice and on the sovereign equality of States .  
The hiring of mercenaries to guarantee internal security and public order in African States could be regarded as a threat to the inalienable sovereign responsibility of States for their own internal order and security and to their responsibility to prevent the repression of their citizens or the violation of their human rights ; and the international community should examine the extent to which it considered the recruitment of mercenaries to be legal .  
Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population . 
On the other hand , the missile attached launched in retaliation by the United States in the southern region of the country causing substantial loss of life , an attack that had been condemned by the international community , constituted a violation of the inalienable right of the Kurdish people to express freely their will without foreign interference and was part of a deliberate campaign by the United States authorities aimed at bringing about the disintegration of the Iraqi State and undermining the national unity and territorial integrity of a sovereign State .  
He reiterated the principles relevant to peacekeeping which had been adopted at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries , held in Cartagena in 1995 , to the effect that peacekeeping operations should strictly adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , particularly the principles of respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , and should be based on the consent of the parties concerned and the principle of impartiality .  
That responsibility should continue until the Palestinian people exercises its inalienable right to self-determination , an independent and sovereign state is established in its national territory , and the problem of the refugees is settled pursuant to the relevant United Nations resolutions .  
Recommendations and decisions of ICSC or resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly concerning the conditions of service of common system staff were not automatically binding , for the following reasons : the organizations were in different financial and budgetary situations ; staff recruitment and retention difficulties varied ; and each common system organization was an independent and sovereign intergovernmental organization and should have the final word regarding the conditions of service of its staff .  
Viet Nam will continue its consistent policy of settling disputes through negotiation in the spirit of equality , mutual respect and understanding , with due respect to international law , particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , and to the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of coastal States over their respective continental shelves and exclusive economic zones .  
Within the original framework of the Charter , democracy was understood as essential to efforts to prevent future aggression , and to support the sovereign State as the basic guarantor of human rights , the basic mechanism for solving national problems and the basic element of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
Moreover , " international relations " - not relations among nations but relations among sovereign States - are increasingly shaped not only by the States themselves but also by an expanding array of non-State actors on the " international " scene , ranging all the way from individual persons to civic associations , non-governmental organizations , local authorities , private multinational business , academia , the media , parliamentarians and regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
We make this statement for the sake of the record of this institution , which was established for the attainment of the goals and ideals reflected in its Charter , maintains its neutrality , supports peoples ' will and is based on the principles of sovereign equality of all States , irrespective of their size , geographical location and military or economic potentialities .  
The Eighth Islamic Summit Conference , held in Tehran last week , inter alia , reaffirmed the commitment of the member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to preserve the legal continuity , unity , territorial integrity and sovereignty of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders and fully supported the establishment of a sovereign , democratic , multi-ethnic and multicultural State of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
These tasks are also dictated by the increase in the membership of the Organization , by the full application of the principles of sovereign equality and equitable geographical representation based on the Organization 's universal nature , and by the recognition that the United Nations remains a viable alternative for Member States .  
The statements and utterances credited to the two Thematic Rapporteurs were not only unfortunate , they were also capable of undermining the impartiality and integrity of these independent and neutral experts appointed by sovereign independent states in the Commission of Human Rights in which Nigeria is an active member .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , as well as others , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 15 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system . 
In this respect , they reaffirmed all 10 principles referred to in the Helsinki Final Act : sovereign equality ; respect for rights inherent in sovereignty ; refraining from the threat or use of force ; inviolability of frontiers ; territorial integrity of States ; peaceful settlement of disputes ; non-intervention in internal affairs ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief ; equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; cooperation among States ; and fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law .  
With its unique nature , its special mandate and its open-ended composition it could contribute greatly to the process of restructuring the Organization , giving an enhanced role to the General Assembly as the most representative body and increasing the representativeness of the Security Council by expanding the participation of developing countries , in conformity with the principle of sovereign equality as well as equitable geographical representation .  
That lack left the door open to different interpretations even of such generally recognized principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-discrimination , non-interference , negotiation in good faith , cooperation between States and the non-use of force , and experience showed how changing the agreed or implied rules of negotiation or backtracking on previous agreements complicated subsequent negotiations .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations , based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
We must be prepared to face other kinds of war : social war against poverty ; judicial war against organized crime ; political war against interventionism in our sovereign economies ; and moral war against the violation of human rights . 
While I would certainly acknowledge that some of the international community 's concern has been justified , I would like very much to say that the Republic of Belarus is a sovereign State that develops its own policy with due regard for the opportunities economic , social , moral and psychological of its citizens , within the limits of international patterns of behaviour and with respect for human rights and personal freedoms . 
And yet in my country , which today is in the grip of civil war , almost everything has been done since the sovereign national conference to spare our young democracy from the tragic upheavals inherent in any sudden social change , which in this case consisted of the move from a single-party political regime banning any organized opposition to a veritable explosion of freedoms individual , political and religious .  
My delegation wishes to emphasize that current realities of the post-cold-war era the diffusion of political , economic and military power among diverse regions of the world require that decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security be made in a more representative and democratic manner , mindful of the sovereign equality of all States .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
In conclusion , my delegation takes this opportunity to strongly reaffirm Malaysia 's well-known position of total commitment and unwavering support for , and abiding solidarity with , the Palestinian people in their valiant struggle for a just and lasting peace and for an independent sovereign state of Palestine , with Jerusalem , the sacred city of Muslims , Christians and Jews , as its capital . 
By enabling the Serbian ethnic community living in the region under the present United Nations Transitional Administration to set up and administer a unique zupanija within the sovereign Croatian State as a form of local self-government or administration or as any other form of organization of that level and meaning in future ;  
Further reaffirms that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
The High Contracting Parties shall base their relations with each other on the principles of mutual respect , sovereign equality , territorial integrity , the inviolability of borders , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of pressure , the right of peoples to control their own destiny , non-interference in internal affairs , observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , cooperation among States , and conscientious fulfilment of international obligations and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
The Presidents agree that the peoples of the Russian Federation and Ukraine shall continue to live and work in peace and harmony , supporting each other at a crucial stage in their history , when they are carrying out , in their independent sovereign States , large-scale reforms with a view to establishing a democratic society and a State based on rule of law , with a socially oriented market economy .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
Recently , both sides informed the Force Commander that , while they would continue to permit UNPREDEP to patrol on the basis of visible and key features of the terrain - including crossing the administrative border when topographical constraints made this a more convenient way of passing from one part of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to another - they retained their sovereign right to patrol their respective territories up to the old administrative border .  
The Government of China maintains that sovereign equality , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs and other norms governing international relations must be respected , and that each country is entitled to choose its own social system and mode of development in the light of its specific national conditions .  
The aforementioned Act , which seeks forcibly to stifle the Cuban social and economic system through the application of punitive measures against sovereign countries that have decided to maintain economic relations with Cuba , was adopted despite the outright rejection with which it was greeted by the international community from its inception as a bill , and particularly by the North American allies , owing to its extraterritorial and unilateral nature and the fact that it infringes the sovereignty of States and violates the principles of international law . 
The Government of Mexico , in full respect for the sovereignty of States and the right of self-determination of peoples , and the norms and principles which govern peaceful and friendly relations and cooperation among nations , believes that it is for the people of Cuba alone , in exercise of their inalienable rights , to continue to determine their own political , economic and social organization in a free , sovereign and independent manner .  
As far as the Russian Federation directly is concerned , it is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of international trade and navigation mentioned in the resolution and supports , and intends to continue to develop normal commercial and economic ties with Cuba based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage and put into practice in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms without any form of discrimination and on the basis of world prices .  
The Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation had held its first ministerial meeting in Mauritius in March 1997 and adopted its charter , the basic principles of which were respect for sovereign equality , territorial integrity and political independence , non-interference in internal affairs , peaceful coexistence and mutual advantage .  
The expert group confirmed that the basic principles of international law to be applied in assessing the legality of coercive economic measures are those of non-intervention and non-discrimination , based on such norms as the sovereignty and sovereign equality of States and the obligation to settle disputes by peaceful means .  
It was argued , moreover , that the text failed to embody important principles such as the sovereign right of States to exploit their own natural resources according to their own policies , the concept of common but differentiated responsibility and the international consensus on the right to development ; it was also considered unfortunate that none of the draft articles had been devoted specifically to the need for an overall balance between environmental and developmental imperatives .  
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
Unfortunately , owing to the obvious and open obstruction by some Contact Group members , our endeavour did not ultimately produce the desired effects , although the state delegation demonstrated great cooperativeness by demanding a minimum as regards the protection of the national interests , independence , territorial integrity and sovereignty of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . This country has done only what any other sovereign country in the world would have done . 
Tajikistan fully supports the Russian Federation 's constructive position on the Yugoslav problem and , as a country that has experienced the horrors of a civil war , believes that the events in Kosovo will give rise to yet another hotbed of tension , jeopardizing the international community 's efforts to implement international norms based on the principles of peaceful coexistence , non-use of force and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States . 
Ever since the Greek Cypriot side 's forceful usurpation of the legitimate seat of government in 1963 , the Greek Cypriot administration has been violating the Turkish Cypriot people 's vested rights of sovereign equality , partnership and fundamental freedoms through a campaign of ethnic cleansing during 1963-1974 and thereafter maintaining an inhuman embargo in all fields . 
It is imperative that the Security Council take urgent measures to condemn most strongly and to halt the NATO aggression against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , an independent , sovereign country and a founding Member State of the United Nations and to request the withdrawal of foreign forces built up by NATO at the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , threatening thereby to escalate the aggression .  
It is incomprehensible to request the withdrawal of the legitimate forces of a sovereign State from its own territory instead of calling for an urgent ending of foreign military aggression , killing of civilians and destruction of civilian targets .  
We would also like to know what measures the NATO members intend to take , and when , to stop and correct the overt , flagrant and continuing violation of the obligations they have undertaken , and how they plan to compensate for the economic and other damage to Yugoslavia and its citizens after the halting of military action against this sovereign member State of OSCE .  
At this time of grief and pain for the peoples of Yugoslavia , Cuba calls on the international community to mobilize its efforts to put an immediate end to this unjustified aggression and to prevent a further , even more regrettable loss of innocent lives , in order to allow this nation to resume the peaceful path of negotiating a solution to its internal problems , a matter solely and exclusively dependent on the sovereign will and self-determination of the Yugoslav peoples . 
Secondly , such a narrow definition of treaties and treaty-making would impede ( or even preclude ) any proper account of indigenous views on these issues , simply because of the widely _ held rationale that indigenous peoples are not States in the current sense of the term in international law , regardless of their generally recognized status as sovereign entities in the era of the Law of Nations .  
Furthermore , this motivation ( in the direct interest of the non-indigenous party ) was quite clear : to legitimize ( via the acquiescence of the autochthonous sovereign of the territories in question ) any right ( real or intended ) with which they could counter opposing claims advanced by other colonial powers vying for control of those lands .  
However , to legitimize beyond any doubt the ways and means used to take issues that originally belonged to the realm of international law away from it and to justify making them subject solely to domestic legislation unilaterally passed by the States and adjudicated by domestic non-indigenous courts , States should produce unassailable proof that the indigenous peoples in question have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes .  
There are abundant examples of this : the 1898 Joint Resolution under which the U.S . Congress , after using force to impose a treaty , consummated the outright annexation of the sovereign State of Hawaii ( which had manifold international juridical relations with other civilized nations ) , and the scramble for Africa formalized at the 1885 Berlin Congress by the colonial powers of the epoch are just two of the many examples .  
It is easy to see the negative effects for indigenous peoples of such a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors , not only on their initial sovereign condition , but also on their overall international juridical status .  
It is important to recall that modern non-indigenous law long ago dispelled the theory which advocated that the absence of formal legal / political recognition by one sovereign entity ( or a group of them ) could determine either the existence or the juridical international status of another .  
recommendations included in the ICPD Programme of Action , and those included in the document to be issued at the end of this session , is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and developmental priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with relevant and universally recognized covenants and agreements . 
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  6 .  The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
The view was expressed that the decision on ratification as well as on rationalization and adaptation of the human rights machinery at the national level was the prerogative of individual sovereign countries rather than an initiative taken by the departments concerned .  
In accordance with the international standards , " a substantial autonomy " implies that some specific powers and rights , such as the right to the use of language , education and information in one 's own tongue , protection and fostering of one 's own culture and tradition as well as local administration affairs , are transferred to the autonomous region , which takes place within the framework of a broader constitutional and legal order in a sovereign State .  
Under international standards " substantial autonomy " implies that some specific competencies and rights , such as the right of minorities to use and receive education and information in their own language , as well as the right to protect and foster individual culture and tradition and the affairs concerning the local administration , are transferred to the field of autonomy within the wider constitutional and legal order of a sovereign State . 
From my perspective the basic premise upon which the CD is established is the conviction that measures to promote and achieve non _ proliferation , arms control and disarmament are vital dimensions of a complex and comprehensive effort to enhance international security between sovereign States and to secure human security for all . 
The policies and laws of economic , commercial and financial blockade and embargo of the United States of America imposed on the Republic of Cuba in the last decades violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and run counter to the common trends of our world today , namely cooperation for development on the basis of equality amongst sovereign States and non-discrimination of political systems .  
We are sure that , given your skilful and widely recognized abilities and leadership , our deliberations will reach a positive conclusion that will be highly beneficial to the international community , and particularly to the nations deprived of free and sovereign access to the sea .  
The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the immutable values of peace , democracy and the rule of law , of human rights , development and social justice , and bearing in mind the sovereign equality of States , the non-interference in their internal affairs and the respect for their territorial integrity .  
The construction is telling proof that the United States Government cares little about the political solution of the situation in Kosovo and Metohija , and that its main concern is to occupy part of the sovereign territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and establish a long-term presence in the autonomous province of its constituent Republic of Serbia under the guise of participating in the United Nations security presence .  
Despite numerous obstacles , the process of implementing the settlement plan and the Houston agreements was back on track after five rounds of direct negotiations between Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Hamra y de Rio de Oro ( POLISARIO ) yielding to the irreversible course of history and the general belief that the conflict could be resolved by the only worthy means , on the basis of the free and sovereign expression of its will by the Saharan people . 
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Although , as reiterated in the Security Council resolutions , all acts of the Abkhaz separatists contravening the sovereign rights of Georgia are null and void , due consideration has to be given to the fact that they have established a consistent pattern of behaviour , directed against attempts to intensify international efforts to diffuse tensions and to secure positive developments in implementing confidence-building measures . 
In 1998 , the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity had recommended that member States should adopt a draft model legislation on access to biological resources at national level ; initiate a process of negotiation among African countries to adopt an African convention on biological diversity ; and develop a common position to safeguard their sovereign rights and the vital interests of local communities .  
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments made by private sector agencies be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
The Russian Federation has repeatedly stated in a number of international forums that it rejects the growing trend towards unilateral extraterritorial application of national laws and measures affecting other States ' trade and foreign relations , since these laws and measures breach international law , violate the principles of the sovereign equality of States and respect for national sovereignty , and undermine peaceful coexistence .  
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Emphasizes that it is important for sovereign risk assessments made by private sector agencies to be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
In a sense , our endeavour to define and , indeed , to promote human security has philosophical and practical implications both positive and negative for us as sovereign States and for the United Nations as the leading global multilateral Organization .  
Hence , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the values of peace , democracy , rule of law , human rights , development and social justice , bearing in mind the principles of sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for their territorial integrity .  
In this regard , the United States believes that there are still substantial issues on which there must be consensus before a draft convention can be considered for adoption , in particular the extent of coastal-State jurisdiction over underwater cultural heritage in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf seaward of 24 nautical miles , and the treatment of vessels and aircraft entitled to sovereign immunity .  
We are confident that a sovereign State of Palestine , with East Jerusalem as its capital and the State of Israel will find an acceptable solution under international guarantees to preserve the political , humanitarian and religious dimensions of the city of Al-Quds , the key to peace .  
Nonetheless , it is also natural , in a democratic international community based on the principles of equitable geographic representation and the sovereign equality of States , that changes to the collective security system be the result of a genuine general agreement , instead of being imposed .  
The Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held at Durban in September 1998 stressed that the expansion and reform of the Security Council must be an indivisible part of a common and complementary process that takes into account the principles of sovereign equality among States and equitable geographic distribution , as well as the need for transparency , accountability and democracy in the working methods of the Security Council , including decision-making therein .  
In Europe the only military bloc left over from the cold war , under its new strategic concept , bypassed the United Nations Security Council and bombed , with the worlds most powerful and sophisticated military machinery , a weak sovereign State , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , turning the Balkan region , which has experienced so much misery in this century , into a testing ground for its new strategy .  
And all those conferences aimed to reach that goal through an organized , yet voluntary effort : a collective effort on a global scale ; an effort by sovereign States and civil society working together ; an effort guided by a common approach based on universal values and principles which we all could accept.So Cairo was not just a population conference .  
For several months the world witnessed a war in the Balkans a region of the world that , in economic terms , is relatively prosperous in which the vital social infrastructure and human potential of a sovereign State were deliberately destroyed .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  
If the Government of a State were to distribute letters in which an ethnic or minority group alleged that it was the victim of repressive measures or that its fundamental human rights were not recognized in the sovereign territory of another State , the Government of Cyprus reserved the right to act in the same way if that practice continued .  
While supporting the principle that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights lay with States , his delegation wished to underline in that regard that initiatives aimed at undermining the territorial integrity or political unity of independent and sovereign States must not be encouraged .  
Its composition and its relations with sovereign States and the United Nations would need the most careful consideration , in order to ensure that the Court would be permanent , effective , independent , efficient , credible and trustworthy .  
Secondly , we are somewhat concerned that the reference at the end of the fourth preambular paragraph to human rights and fundamental freedoms could be misconstrued by certain quarters in order to promote objectives which are in fact contrary to the stated objectives of this draft resolution and to promote interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States .  
As indicated in the communiqu of the SADC Summit meeting on the Democratic Republic of the Congo held on 23 August 1998 , the reconstruction of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as an independent , sovereign , united , peaceful , stable and prosperous country is critical to the achievement of the same objectives in the region and in the rest of the African continent .  
He noted that the recent upsurge in transnational crime had resulted in the penetration of central Asia by criminal groups and that the development of effective legislative frameworks and legal mechanisms for fighting crime had become a priority of the new sovereign States in that area .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights . 6 . The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
The two sides maintain that international terrorism , religious extremism and national separatism in all its forms , as well as transnational criminal activities ( such as illicit trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs and psychotropic and explosive substances , and economic offences ) have now become serious threats to the security of sovereign States and to international peace and security .  
Every State had a sovereign right to enact national legislation that reflected the cultural values and imperatives of the society concerned , ensuring the security and safety of individuals in accordance with internationally agreed principles relating to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Being an integral part of Europe , Bulgaria regards accelerated accession to the European Union and full membership in North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) as an expression of our sovereign political choice based on broad public support .  
The international community must continue to provide unswerving support to a sovereign , united , multiethnic , multicultural and prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina , at peace with itself and contributing to international peace and security .  
A deliberate action calculated to step up ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Serbs and other nonAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija , it is a means of imposing neocolonialist control over the natural , material and human resources of a sovereign country .  
Expansion of the membership must be responsive to the changed global political and economic climate , reflecting the new realities in the global arena and respecting the principles of sovereign equality among all States and equitable geographical distribution .  
All this is accompanied by the establishment of illegal armed formations , blatant interference from abroad in the affairs of sovereign States and the creation of new hotbeds of tension , leading increasingly to the largescale loss of innocent lives .  
It is essential that the truth be told to the international community of the tragedy at Racak ; that the practice of issuing sealed warrants be abandoned ; and that the secret 1996 memorandum between the ICTY and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) sanctioning the hunting down of indictees that has often led to the murder and death of suspects , in violation of the borders of sovereign States be published .  
We also express , together with all other Arab States , our concern that Somalia become again a united , fully sovereign and independent State able to defend the vital interests of the Somali people , following the attempts by evil forces external and internal to tear apart the social and political fabric of its society and destroy its economic infrastructure .  
In conclusion , as East Timor grows into a full-fledged sovereign and independent nation , the international community has a solemn responsibility to support measures including building bridges of understanding towards achieving reconciliation , strengthening the foundations of government based on democratic and transparent practices , and promoting capacity-building programmes .  
The Court should not be subject to political pressure ; rather , it must be a respectable , credible institution that would prevent certain States from committing regrettable acts such as allowing their judicial officers to recklessly prosecute the political leaders of other sovereign , independent States with whose policies they disagreed ; it should also put a final end to State terrorism of the type currently engaged in by Rwandans , Ugandans and Burundians against his country . 
Within this context , and also in light of growing interdependence in an era of globalization , some delegations emphasized that developing and developed countries shared responsibilities in realizing rights and should fulfil their duties in a manner that promoted equitable development based on sovereign equality , mutual interest and cooperation .  
As it condemns these acts of aggression against Iraqi targets and installations , the Government of Iraq urges you to perform your assigned duties as they relate to the maintenance of international peace and security by intervening with the governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt , end and desist from any resumption of their constant and unwarranted aggression against an independent , sovereign State . 
The development of a comprehensive convention on international space law with due regard for the sovereign rights of States could help to resolve such difficult issues as the delimitation and definition of outer space , control of space pollution , management of scientific research and commercial activities in outer space , registration of space objects , protection of intellectual property , responsibility and the settlement of disputes .  
As it condemns these acts of aggression against Iraqi targets and installations , the Government of Iraq urges you to perform the duties assigned to you under the Charter as they relate to the maintenance of international peace and security by intervening with the Governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt , end and desist from any resumption of their constant and unwarranted aggression against an independent , sovereign State .  
As it condemns these acts of aggression against Iraqi targets and installations , the Government of Iraq urges you to perform the duties assigned to you under the Charter as they relate to the maintenance of international peace and security by intervening with the governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt , end and desist from any resumption of their constant and unwarranted aggression against an independent , sovereign State .  
As it condemns these acts of aggression against Iraqi targets and installations , the Government of Iraq urges you to perform the duties assigned to you [ under the Charter ] as they relate to the maintenance of international peace and security by intervening with the governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt , end and desist from any resumption of their constant and unwarranted aggression against an independent , sovereign State .  
As it condemns these acts of aggression against Iraqi targets and installations , the Government of Iraq urges you to perform the duties assigned to you [ under the Charter ] as they relate to the maintenance of international peace and security by intervening with the governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt , end and desist from any resumption of their constant and unwarranted aggression against an independent , sovereign State .  
These are the precise considerations that led to Russias initiative to convene a Balkan summit , with a view to the conclusion , by the States of the region and interested neighbouring countries , of a legally binding agreement that would set out mutual obligations for absolute compliance with the fundamental principles of State relations , the most important of which are the inviolability of borders , sovereign equality , respect for territorial integrity , non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States and the non-use of force . 
As it condemns these acts of aggression against Iraqi targets and installations , the Government of Iraq urges you to perform the duties assigned to you [ under the Charter ] as they relate to the maintenance of international peace and security by intervening with the governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt , end and desist from any resumption of their constant and unwarranted aggression against an independent , sovereign State .  
The application of such laws , which are intended to restrict the access of the targeted sovereign States and Members of the United Nations to markets , capital , technology and investment in order to exert pressure upon them to change their political and economic orientation is a flagrant violation of the principles of international law , the Charter of the United Nations and numerous other resolutions of the General Assembly .  
But we are prepared for cooperation as sovereign equals , in accordance with the new realities of a world where the principal national objectives of States can be achieved through economic and political cooperation , rather than military conquest or regional or global domination .
