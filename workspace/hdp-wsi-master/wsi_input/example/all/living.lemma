With Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important expositions and the major policy decisions as the guide , the Navy party committee shared the work among its standing committee members .  Through the activities of inspecting and guiding work at the grassroots units , going to sea on the vessels , working and living with the rank and file , and having heart-to-heart talks with them , the party committee introduced more than 30 theoretical research topics , which included political building , military training , equipment scientific research , and logistics supply for Navy building in the new period .

"  
In view of the drop in people 's income expectations and the rise in their expenditure expectations , and their insufficient consumption capacity , we raised the standard of the basic living needs of workers laid off from state enterprises , the unemployed , those urban residents eligible for the lowest basic living needs , and others on low incomes , and increased the wages of workers of organs , undertakings , and units , and the pensions of retired personnel .  
and the major measures should meet the requirements for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , planning state key construction projects well , effectively improving people 's living standards , actively promoting employment , and succeeding in social security work and sustainable development .  
Take our Jian area as an example : After reform and opening up , it practiced the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and the cooperative shares system and adopted multiple operational forms in the state-owned enterprises , so that the economic strength repeatedly increased , the people 's living standards were continuously enhanced , and the peasants ' per capita income grew from 130 yuan in 1978 to more than 2,000 yuan last year .  
and having heard and examined five special reports - - the State Council 's report on ensuring basic living allowance for people such as laid-off workers of state-owned enterprises , report on raising peasants ' incomes and reducing their burdens , report on building of public security contingents in recent years , report on management of the cultural market , and report on preventing and tackling atmospheric pollution in Beijing Municipality .  
For the past two years , facts have proved that the implementation of the proactive policy has achieved remarkable success .  Despite an increase in both the fiscal deficit and the size of debts , the implementation of the proactive policy has safeguarded social stability , maintained sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , and raised the living standard .  
The initial stage refers to the historical stage in which the situation of the impoverished population accounting for a large proportion and the people 's living standards being comparatively low will be gradually changed so that the entire people will become comparatively prosperous .  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , China has persistently followed the principle of national unity and common development and properly handled the relations among reform , development , and stability , thus ensuring the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy and the noticeable improvement of the people 's living standards .  
We should ensure availability and properly make use of funds needed for social insurance and the normal functioning of state organs , to ensure that basic living expenses of laid-off staff members and workers of state-owned enterprises , basic old-age pensions of retired personnel , minimum living expenses of urban residents , and wages of public functionaries , are disbursed in full and on time .  
Most comrades are now seizing time to study and work hard ; but , undeniably , there still exist many phenomena of not treasuring time : a lot of valuable time is wasted by overstaffing , buck-passing , mountains of documents , oceans of meetings , empty talk , platitudes , fault-finding , meaningless debate , blind decision-making , misguided and arbitrary command , absent-mindedness , doing nothing , extravagant living , and pleasure-seeking .  All this is truly painful to see and worrisome .  
Thanks to the achievements of modern science and technology , modern people enjoy a higher level of living standard .  Rapid progress has also been made in medical science .  With the exception of an extremely small number of complicated diseases that need more researches and studies to overcome them , common diseases can be cured by proper treatment .  
Now , the vast majority of the rest of the poor are those living in remote areas which are hard to get to and lacking in resources and where the ecological environment is extremely bad .  
It is even more important that in the 50 years since the founding of New China , particularly since the start of reform and opening up , the overall strength of our country has been remarkably enhanced , the people 's living standard is approaching a better-off level of moderate prosperity , and we have had a sufficient economic strength to increase our support to the Central Western Region ;  
It seems that the United States is only accustomed to a relationship in which it gives the orders and other countries obey , and is not yet accustomed to living on equal terms with other countries ; it is only accustomed to living in an impossible uniform world regulated by itself , and is not yet accustomed to living in the real pluralistic world .  
The telegram says : In the past 45 years , under the leadership of the Lao People 's Revolutionary Party , the people of all nationalities in Laos won a victory in national and democratic revolution , established the Lao People 's Democratic Republic , and continuously made new achievements in safeguarding national independence and state sovereignty and developing national undertakings .  In particular , since the initiation of the innovation and opening up drive , Laos has made ceaseless progress in all undertakings and made noticeable achievements in continuously improving the people 's living standards .  
First , it led the people to establish new China , thus putting an end to the history of being very much enslaved and plundered by foreign countries and savaged by one war after another and the masses living on the edge of starvation in old China and providing fundamental political premises , stable social environments , and excellent social conditions for the development of social productive forces in China .  
Since reform and opening up , the living standards of the people in our country have been constantly improving and the actual incomes of urban and rural residents rapidly increasing .  With the remarkable improvement in living conditions , the problem of food and clothing for the people in the whole country has been basically resolved and they are now even marching toward the comparatively well-off level .  
We succeeded in achieving the goal of quadrupling the value of the gross output on the basis of the 1980 figures ahead of time .  Moreover , while the population continued to grow , we also achieved the goal of quadrupling the per capita amount of the value of the gross national output , thus raising social productivity and the people 's living standards to substantively higher level .  
After this five-year plan is fulfilled , with the efforts of five more years , that is , by the year 2010 , we will establish a sound and perfect socialist market economic structure , and will further double the value of the gross national output on the basis of the 2000 figure , thus further enhancing the people 's living standards .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .  Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
The variety of grain supply will be determined by the provincial governments in accordance with the living habits of peasants in the areas where the grain plots are returned to forests and grasslands , the variety of grains originally planted in the areas where the grain plots are returned to forests and grasslands , and the actual situation of grain in stock in the locality in an effort to better meet the basic living need of peasants in these areas .

Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have exerted ourselves to carry out a series of policies to enrich the people formulated by the central authorities , unceasingly satisfied the people 's ever growing material and cultural demands , and brought about improvement in the economic and social level and the people 's living standards .  
The track of Hu Changqing 's downfall once again warns us that because of the long-time environment of peaceful construction and the ever-improving living conditions , some people have grown indolent and have developed hedonistic tendencies and are harboring thoughts of loose living and idleness .  This is the main reason for the rampant corruption today .  
China is a socialist country ; it must strive to build strong state finance in order to press forward the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , continually enhance the material and cultural living standards of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and preserve social stability and state economic and national defense security .  
For the state to set aside some fiscal revenue to ensure the basic living needs and reemployment of laid-off state enterprise workers is not only the demand of implementing the party 's program of wholehearted service for the people , but is also the requirement of creating and stable social environment for the continued development of reform and construction .  
As a result of over 20 years of reform and development , there has been great improvement of our comprehensive national strength , social productive forces , and people 's living standards ; we have progressed by leaps and bounds in building socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and legal system ; and the whole world has seen the great vitality and vigor demonstrated by socialism in China .  
We are happy to see that Turkey 's people , with their own capable hands , obtained an outstanding accomplishment while in the midst of the process of building their own country .  The society is unceasingly progressing , the economy is rapidly developing , the living standard of the people is increasing day by day , and Turkey has already become a spectacular country in the international community .  
It is precisely because of the implementation of this policy that we have been able to break through the " egalitarianism " that has stifled us for many years , frustrating the people 's enthusiasm , and have been able to fully mobilize and stimulate the great enthusiasm and creativity of workers .  It has greatly liberated and developed productivity , continually raised the masses ' standard of living , and markedly strengthened overall national power .  
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
In the past two decades since the beginning of reform and opening up , our country 's overall national power has significantly strengthened , people 's living standard has been constantly improved and our international position had been greatly raised .  The most fundamental reason is due to the rapid and healthy economic and social development .  
We should combine that basis with the thinking of officers and men , carry out psychological adjustment education , provide guidance to officers and men to cultivate lofty ideals , for good mentality , for living well , and to help lay a solid ideological foundation for training " four haves " military personnel .  
in our country , social productivity , comprehensive national strength , and the people 's living standards were all raised to a higher and higher level ; gratifying reports came from all fronts ; our nation 's international status was obviously enhanced .  
China 's funds for national defense construction are all used for protecting state security and territorial integrity .  China keeps the army in condition but will not engage in unjust military ventures .  The limited military expenditures are used to raise the living standard of officers and soldiers and improve weapons and equipment .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , our comprehensive national strength continued to grow , the productivity continued to rise to a higher and higher level , and the people 's living quality also continued to improve .  The interests of the broadest people were continuously fulfilled and guaranteed .  The leadership of the CPC won heartfelt support of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  
Li Ruihuan said that China and Russia are facing huge domestic tasks in developing their economy and improving living standards , and they hold identical or similar views on many major international issues ; their two economies are strongly complementary , and there are broad prospects for developing bilateral friendly cooperation .  
Since the 1960s and 1970s , many countries and regions of Asia have taken a practical approach , implementing development strategies of catching up and surpassing , rising quickly from the post-war ruins , achieving sustained and rapid economic growth , greatly improving the standard of living of the people , and writing a new chapter in the promotion of world economic development .  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .  
The people are now seeking the enhancement of their life quality after they achieved quantitative satisfaction .  The broad masses have truly feel the great superiority of socialism from their personal experience in the great enhancement of their own living standards , and support socialism from the bottom of their hearts .  Socialism has won an extensive and profound mass foundation in China .  
Long fed up with noise caused by flight training of US military planes , some 5,500 Japanese citizens living near Kadena Air Base in Okinawa angrily filed a suit in Okinawa Prefecture Court on 27 March this year accusing the Japanese Government of an " illegal act " in allowing US forces to set up military bases in residential areas , calling on US forces to immediately cease night flights , and demanding 6 billion Japanese yen in reparation to victims .  
On 16 August the delegation convened in Beijing a " seminar of Chinese religious circles on world peace issues " , at which speeches were made by the principal responsible persons of China 's five main nationwide religions , namely Buddhism , Taoism , Islamism , Catholicism , and Protestantism , who are members of the delegation .  These speeches fully expressed the stance , views , and ideas of Chinese religious circles on preserving world peace and creating a beautiful living space for mankind .  
The " three protection line " system of ensuring the basic living of the furloughed staff and workers from state-owned enterprises , providing unemployment insurance , and ensuring minimum living standard for residents living in urban areas has been basically established and the social insurance system mainly focusing on basic pension insurance , unemployment insurance , and basic medical insurance for staff and workers living in cities and towns has been initially set up .  
It has actively pushed forward the reform of retirement , unemployment , and medical insurance .  It has made concentrated efforts to ensure that the basic livelihood of laid-off SOE workers is guaranteed and that pensions are fully paid to the retirees , and to establish three safeguard systems , that is , the system for providing basic livelihood for laid-off SOE workers , the unemployment insurance system , and the system for guaranteeing the minimum living standards for urban residents .  
Ever since the beginning of reform and opening up , in particular , earthshaking changes have taken place in Sichuan . The province has deepened its reform , rapidly opened itself wider to the outside world , attained high-speed economic growth , brought about comprehensive progress to all its social undertakings , and has provided a comfortable living and working environment for its people .  The entire province is now enjoying a sound national unity , a stable political situation , and prevailing social stability .  
learn from his style of studying diligently , attaching importance to investigation and research , and working carefully and meticulously with fastidious attention , to denounce the unhealthy tendency of falsification and performing duties in a perfunctory manner ; and learn from his excellent quality of cleanness , uprightness , honesty , hard work , and thrifty living , to forever maintain the true political colors of plain living and hard struggle .  
Comrade Geng Biao upheld the policy of practicing economy while conducting diplomatic activities .  He was strict with himself and never gave any thought about personal fame and wealth .  He sought no privilege for himself and always maintained the distinctive political character of plain living and hard struggle .  
The standard of our productive forces has risen substantially ; we have further gained comprehensive national strength , and the people as a whole have attained a comfortable standard of living .  
It has accurately epitomized and given a high appraisal to the following three major changes in history .  Namely , the productive forces have been greatly intensified , and the people have generally attained a moderately high standard of living .  Also , three major changes have taken place in social and economic activities in market supply and demand , in institutional environment in economic development , and in economic relations with foreign countries .  
In resolving the existing outstanding problems in rural reform and development and achieving a new flying leap in China 's agriculture and rural economy , it is essential to regard development of the rural economy as the main theme , regard deepening the rural reforms and rejuvenating agriculture through science and technology as the motive force , and regard improving the basic living standards of the peasants as the fundamental starting point , and to do a great deal of work in all respects .  
Party committees and governments in all localities included the warmth-giving activities in their overall work arrangements .  In the whole country , 358,000 leading cadres at all levels set up fixed connection with 45,000 enterprises encountering business difficulties and 629,000 worker families living in difficult condition for helping and supporting them .  This further advanced the process of constantly carrying out the warmth-giving activities and institutionalizing such activities on the basis of taking them as regular social activities .  
The requirements for the " two guarantees " work should be invariably fulfilled , and the principal leaders of the party committees and governments in various localities should continue to take charge of this work firmly and effectively , further enlarge the coverage of social insurance , tighten the fund collection and handover in accordance with the law , achieve the goal of granting old-age pensions by society at large in a comprehensive way , and quicken the tempo of improving and perfecting the system to provide basic living expenses for urban residents .  
Our undertaking of reform , opening up and socialist modernization has been pushed forward into a new stage .  In China today , it is a scene of political stability , economic development , national unity , social progress , constantly improving living standard , and prosperity .  
Within a very short period of 20 years , Chinese economy made huge progress , the people 's living standards rose to a new height , and the integrated national strength made an enormous step forward .  
Based on the overall strategic plan for national economic and social development for the new period , in the next five to 10 years the tourist industry should play a more vigorous role in promoting reform and opening-up , implementing the policy of expanding domestic demand , accelerating economic restructuring , and improving the people 's living standards .  
To build on progress and create greater glories , we must consider the constant improvement of the people 's standard of living to be the fundamental starting point for all of our work .  While we continue to take care of everyday affairs for the people year after year , we must join together to make some major accomplishments that all of the people of Beijing can see and feel , and that will bring even more real benefits to the people in the city and in outlying areas .  
In the New Year editorial , the DPRK stated that it would , in the new year , " streamline the current economic foundation , carry out comprehensive transformation of the economy with modern technologies and methods , step up the building of power , coal , metallurgy , rail transport sectors , increase agricultural production , develop the light industry , and raise the people 's living standards . "  
Researchers Pan Houren and Zhou Jiahua held that today , when material living standards are improving all the time , it is extremely important to build a rich and excellent cultural life ; the current measures such as small district sports and public welfare facilities which are now being built in a big way , and the rural cultural activities launched by organizing peasants who have become rich are extremely beneficial .  
In Chinese society today when we are carrying out socialist modernization , the greatest benevolence is whatever is beneficial for developing the social productive forces , increasing all-round national strength , and improving living standards ; otherwise , a thing is non-benevolent or is evil .  
We hope various levels of party committees and governments across the autonomous region will earnestly put into effect the party 's policies toward agricultural and pastoral areas and unite and lead the broad masses of cadres to develop production , improve living standards , " bring social order out of chaos , " and " tackle problems caused by stupidity , " so that our region will advance by leaps and bounds and achieve prolonged political stability .  
During these five years China has enjoyed political stability , economic development , social progress , and ethnic solidarity ; all-round national strength has risen to a new level , living standards have on the whole reached a comfortably well-off level , and we have victoriously achieved the second strategic goal in socialist modernization .  
Only when development is accelerated can the living standards of the people of all nationalities in our region be improved and the increasingly growing needs of material and cultural life be met , and only when development is accelerated can the new-type socialist nationality relationship characterized by equality , unity , and mutual help be consolidated and developed and national solidarity be consolidated and enhanced .  
Given a land mass constituting only 7 percent of the world 's farming area , China has successfully resolved the issue of basic needs for a population making up 22 percent of the world population .  The number of impoverished persons has decreased considerably and the people 's standard of living has improved significantly .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
Luo Gan said : Ever since the Central Committee held its third meeting to discuss projects to be launched in Tibet , Tibet autonomous region , as result of doing its jobs while adhering to the Central Committee 's lines and general and specific policies , has been able to enjoy one of its best periods in history in terms of economic development , social stability , national unity , strong border defense , and people 's living conditions .  
Therefore , we must , through constant efforts , further liberalize thinking , renew ideas , expand efforts to open up to the outside , seize opportunities , and accelerate development so as to bring more visible and tangible benefits to the Tibetan people and increasingly improve the material and cultural standard of living for the people .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States has indeed enjoyed nearly 10 years of sustained economic growth , but in respect of citizens ' rights of existence , the gap between rich and poor in American society is growing and the population living in poverty is increasing .  
It firmly takes the steady improvement of the living standards , both material and cultural , of the urban and rural populations as the essential demand of socialism , the fundamental goal of economic development , and the meeting point of the effort to properly handle the relations among reform , development , and stability .  It gives priority to resolving the problems that are of widespread concern to the ordinary people ;  
Efforts will be made to properly handle the relationship between reform , development , and stability , create more jobs , perfect the social security system , rationally regulate income distribution , keep improving people 's living standard , strengthen the building of clean government , tackle problems of common concern among the masses , and bring stability and harmony to the entire society .  
Over 90 percent of the detachments under the battalion level in the whole army have fulfilled the comprehensive management of barracks .  With the noticeable improvement in dwelling and living conditions , the difficulties for those troops stationed at the frontiers , islands , highlands , and other arduous areas like seeing doctors , taking baths , drinking water , using electricity , and so on have also been resolved in a more satisfactory manner .  
The delegation also held special report sessions on " opposing evil cult , guaranteeing human rights " for Chinese students studying in France and for overseas Chinese living and working in France . During its visit , the delegation also met with leaders of the French official and non-governmental anti-cult organizations and leaders of the French religious circles .  Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
We shall takedevelopment as a main theme , take restructuring as a main line , take reform , opening-up , scientific and technological innovations as driving forces , andtake the enhancement of the people 's living standards as a fundamental startingpoint , continue to promote comprehensive economic and social development .  
Jiang Zemin said : " Uruguay is beautiful and fertile .  It has long-term political stability and sustained economic development .  The people 's living standard has continued to rise and the country has played a positive role in international affairs .  
People of countries the world over , politicians , political parties , social groups , and media of many countries including the United States , and overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have made speeches and published articles supporting the Chinese Government 's just stance and the spirit of struggle in showing no fear of mighty power , attacked the unreasonable and unjustified US attitude , and exposed the US conspiracy to trample on the sovereignty of other countries and establish world hegemony .  
It is precisely at this crucial moment that Comrade Jiang Zemin made the remark that the Communist Party of China must represent the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  He has enriched the political connotation conducive to raising the people 's living standards , and turned the reconstruction of the mode of cultural life and the expansion of advanced culture into the process of China 's modernization drive .  As a result , he has provided China with more attractive cultural resources .  
In one way or another , overseas Chinese and Chinese nationals living in different parts of the world condemned the conduct of the US military reconnaissance plane of ramming into and destroying the Chinese aircraft .  They firmly supported the Chinese Government 's just stand , and they extended their respects to heroic pilot Wang Wei , whose whereabouts were still unknown .  
He fully expressed the lofty demeanour of a proletarian revolutionary and the fine work style of a Chinese communist by his hard work and plain living , modesty and prudence , diligence and pragmatism , and selfless devotion .  
Comrade Wang Wei had ambitious revolutionary ideals and a lofty spirit of dedication .  He set a fine example in living up to our army 's fundamental purpose and faithfully carried out our army 's fundamental function and thus was an outstanding representative of revolutionary servicemen of the new generation .  
He was hard working and plain living , modest and prudent , strict with himself and lenient toward others , honest in performing his official duties , and esteemed and loved by the broad masses of cadres and people .  
The percentage of China 's poverty-stricken population has been lowered to the lowest level in history and the standard of living of the people has been greatly improved .  We have made a leap from being poor to having sufficient food and clothing and another from having sufficient food and clothing to living a relatively well-off life .  
Since the Eighth CPV National Congress , the CPV has continued to uphold Marxism-Leninism , Ho Chi-minh thought , and the CPV 's leadership , adhered to the socialist road , and carried out sweeping reform with determination , thus maintaining stability of the country ; and , as a result , Vietnam 's economy has been growing relatively rapidly , its people 's living standards have been continuing to improve , and its international status has been further rising , demonstrating the great vitality and vigor of the socialist system .  
It is hoped that implementing the great western development will gradually narrow the gap between the living standards in the east and the west and bring dramatic changes to the troops ' work and living environment as a result , and the masses of officers and men who have planted roots in the west to devote themselves to our national defense will become even more enthusiastic and energetic .  
From bustling cities to remote countryside , from gray-haired elderly people to children , and from people of all nationalities at home to overseas Chinese and people of Chinese origin living abroad - - everyone 's heart was with Wang Wei , everyone 's attention was drawn to the South China Sea , and everyone kept a close eye on every development and news about the rescue work .  
The Party 's Central Committee and the State Council place a high level of emphasis on these issues and are extremely concerned with safeguarding the lives of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and their re-employment .  They are speeding up implementation of social security system reform and have done a great deal of highly effective work to bring about the two ' guarantees ' ( guaranteeing the basic living expenses of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and guaranteeing the on-time issue and proper amount of old age pensions for retired workers ) .  
At Juncheng Township which was the site of the headquarters of the Jin-Cha-Ji [ Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei ] Military District , Wen Jiabao held cordial talks with veteran fighters of the Eighth Route Army who had taken part in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the mass production movement in Yanan . Wen Jiabao inquired about the living conditions of the local people in details and took part in a discussion meeting with local cadres and masses on current rural work .  
Li Ruihuan said : We are glad to see that the Libyan people , under the leadership of Qadhafi , selected a path of development suited to the national conditions and achieved distinguished results in safeguarding national independence and sovereignty , developing the national economy , and improving the people 's living conditions .  
Since the start of reform and opening up , especially since the third central conference on work in Tibet , various undertakings have surged forward full of vigor , the outlook of urban and rural areas has changed greatly , and people 's living standards have been raised .  All those are unprecedented in the history of Tibet .  
Raidi pointed out : In Tibet , there is now smooth administration , all kinds of businesses are thriving , the society is stable , people of various nationalities are united , border defense has been consolidated , and people are living in peace and happiness .  Tibet is now in the best period of development since peaceful liberation in terms of social stability and economic development .  
When answering the question " what do you think deserves the most earnest congratulations in the 50 years since Tibet 's peaceful liberation , " 90 percent of the residents ' answer was : the shattering of the yoke of the feudal serfdom .  As a result , a-million serfs have stood up and have been masters of their fate .  They are now living an equal , harmonious , and independent new life .  
Accompanied by Hubei Governor Zhang Guoguang and other comrades , Luo Gan conducted investigation and study of the progress of the struggle to strike hard and put things in order from 11 to 15 May . He inspected units such as police substations , criminal police units , prisons , reform-through-labor camps , shopping malls , residential living quarters , and large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises , and paid a cordial call to express solicitude for the family members of a model public security policeman who died while on duty .  
Raidi , chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People 's Congress , noted : " Tibet is at its best time in history , for it now enjoys sound social progress , economic growth , and national unity ; its border defense remains strong and consolidated ; and its people are living a prosperous and content life .  All this does not come easily . "  
It has been more than a month since the national work conference on rectifying and standardizing market economic order was held .  During that period , all localities and all departments have been conscientiously living up to the spirit of the central work conference in light of local conditions and taken effective and concrete measures to launch market economic order rectification work , with emphasis on investigating a number of major and large cases , with some initial success .  
we must adhere to the guiding principle of " one central task , two important jobs , and three assurances , " i.e . , we should regard economic construction as the central task , closely attend to maintaining stability and developing the economy , and ensure long-term social peace and stability in Tibet , ensure the rapid development of Tibet 's economy , and ensure notable improvement of the living standard of the people of Tibet ;  
Over the past few years , in order to seek the status as a so-called " independent political entity " in the international arena , the Taiwan authorities , in the name of expanding " international living space , " have devoted massive manpower and material and financial resources to pursuing " money diplomacy .

Under the guidance of the " 17-point agreement , " the people in Tibet drove out the imperialist invading forces , put an end to the state of permanently being backward , sealed off , and stagnant , and made great progress which has attracted worldwide attention in the short period of 50 years .  The economic development , social progress , and remarkable improvement in the living standards of the people are trends of history .  
All of the 62 engineering projects which were built with aid from the whole country to Tibet have already been delivered for use , the situation of infrastructures in Tibet like transportation , energy resources , and communications lagging seriously behind has been greatly improved , its priority industries have been developed , and the living standards of the people have been further increased .  These are vivid embodiments of the central authorities applying the ideology of development to direct the work in Tibet .  
We must persist in focusing our vision on enhancing the overall qualities of the rural grassroots cadres , on resolving current conspicuous problems in the rural areas , and on safeguarding and developing the interests of the peasants ; in particular , we should do a number of practical things centering on rural economic development , to improve rural production and living conditions and make efforts to increase peasant incomes .  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
Their arduous efforts have brought about a great change in the look of poor areas : Their production means and living conditions have been markedly improved ; their production level raised by a big margin ; and great progress has been made in the scientific and technological , educational , cultural , and public health fields .  
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
Raidi , chairman of the Tibet regional people 's congress standing committee , said : Currently Tibet is in the best period in history .  Tibet has been enjoying social progress , economic prosperity , and ethnic unity ; frontier defense in Tibet is ensured ; people of Tibet have been living and working in peace and contentment ; and the anti-splittism struggle has developed from being in a passive position and taking measures to cope with emergencies to taking the initiative to deal with things .  These achievements have not come by easily .  
During the last 50 years , thanks to the concern of the central authorities and the support of the people in the rest of the country , the party , the government , the military , the police , and the people were united as one and worked hard and perseveringly to accomplish the tremendous achievement of rapid economic development , all-round social progress , and continuous improvement in the people 's living standards .  The entire region has gone through earth-shaking changes .  
We must always uphold the guidelines for work in Tibet during the new period formulated at the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , which call for " taking economic construction as the central task ; firmly focusing on the two major tasks of developing the economy and stabilizing the situation ; and ensuring Tibet 's accelerated economic development , all-round social progress , lasting peace and stability , and continuous improvement of the people 's living standards . "  
We will focus firmly on the central task of developing the western region on a large scale ; persistently follow the guidelines for work in Tibet in the new period ; and make the acceleration of development the main theme , the expansion of an economy characteristic of Tibet and economic restructuring the masterstrokes , the reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force , and the improvement of the people 's living standards the basic point of departure .  
Only evaluating " horses " will be tantamount to give the power of initiative on personnel training to history , making the difficult process of personnel training a process of living or dying without external interference .  When there is an urgent need , there will be shortages of needed personnel , and it then becomes necessary to pick the taller ones among short people .  
This partnership is aimed at pursuing common development through increased bilateral cooperation , proceeding from the reality that both China and Venezuela are developing nations faced with the task of expediting economic development to raise the living standards of the people .  
Hu Jintao pointed out : Since the beginning of this year , the whole party and the whole nation have been conscientiously implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee and the party Central Committee 's major policy decisions and vigorously advancing the drive for socialist modernization by persistently taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal .  
He further hoped that the quality education base for youths and the science and technology hall will extend the quality education of schools and allow every middle and elementary school student to be trained and nurtured in creative thinking , willpower and moral character , physical health , environmental protection sense , and capability in practical living .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that the party Central Committee and General Secretary Jiang Zemin pay great attention to the development of minority ethnic groups and areas inhabited by them and are concerned about improving the living standard of minority ethnic groups .  An important focus of attention and starting point in implementing the strategy of developing the western region is to help areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups develop faster .  
Similarly , it is impossible for Hong Kong to turn a blind eye to Falungong , which has been increasingly involved in political and international affairs and has disturbed the normal living order of citizens .  The HKSAR Government must assume responsibility for the security and stability of Hong Kong . Hence , the government 's stance and methods are totally reasonable and necessary .  
To carry out economic construction as the central task is the basic means and fundamental way out for us to break free of poverty and backwardness , attain all-round social progress in Tibet , constantly satisfy the people 's needs materially and culturally , ensure a constant improvement in the people 's living standard and join the rest of the country in achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living .  
Use Marxist materialist conception of history to gradually weaken idealist theism , replace feudalism and superstition and ignorance and backwardness with modern knowledge in science and technology , divert the attention of religion believers toward developing the economy and improving living standard materially and culturally , and guide religion into categories compatible with the socialist society for the temples , monks and nuns to play a positive and useful role in social life .  
In the view of sociology , no country or nation has a tradition , custom , daily life habit or style of living that will remain forever unchangeable .  Everything will change with economic and social development and change in people 's concept .  It is the law governing the course of history that fine customs compatible with social progress will be preserved while the backward habits that impede social progress will be discarded .  
The CPC , which had captured victory nationwide , was faced with a daunting challenge : Can it create advanced productive forces on the basis of old China , where poverty and backwardness had been endemic , and raise the living standard of the masses ?  " A serious economic construction task confronts us . "  
The Chinese government will continue to make development the main theme , make structural adjustment the main line , make reform and opening up and technical progress the motivation , make raising the people 's living standards the fundamental objective , and industriously take steps forward for economic development and social advance .  
The fourth is the tradition of deep affection for the motherland and hometown .  They constantly show concern for the economic , political , and social development of the motherland , as well as the living conditions of their beloved ones , consider it as an honor to be able to make contributions to their fellow countrymen , and take pride in the magnificent and long-standing history and culture of their nation .  
Without enhancing the level of productive forces , it is impossible to consolidate the political power , maintain social stability , improve the living standards of the people , and develop the spiritual civilization and the democratic and legal system .  
He said , overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have transnational culture , and there are also many specialized talented people among them ; there are more than 100,000 highly talented Chinese in science and technology and various specialities in North America ; this is advantageous for the United States in opening up the China market , for China 's economic construction , and for ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese to develop their business .  
The overall standard of living has already reached a well-off level and China now has a considerable group of wealthy people .  The objective for the second strategic step of socialist modernization has been realized in a general fashion .  
Jiang Zemin said that we can sum up the basic experience of our Tibet work in the following main areas : first , persist in making economic construction the focus , closely seizing upon the two major events of economic development and situational stability , and adhering to the guiding principles of the three safeguards which are safeguarding accelerated economic development and the overall social progress in Tibet , safeguarding national security and long-term stability in Tibet , and safeguarding a constantly improving standard of living for the people of every nationality in Tibet ;  
The guiding ideology of the party Central Committee toward strengthening Tibet work is to regard Deng Xiaoping theory and the party 's basic line as the guidance , persist in making economic construction the focus , closely seize upon the two major events which are economic development and situational stability , adhere to the three safeguards which are safeguarding accelerated economic growth and overall social progress in Tibet , safeguarding national safety and long-term stability in Tibet , and safeguarding constant improvements in the standard of living for the people of every nationality in Tibet .  
We must further liberate thinking , renew ideas , persist in regarding development as the theme , structural readjustment as the base line , liberalized reforms and scientific and technological progress as the driving force , and improvement of the people 's standard of living as the fundamental starting point , use creative thinking to resolve the prominent issues arising in the process of economic and social development in Tibet , and put into place good cycles in Tibet work .  
Over the past 80 years , under the leadership of the glorious CPC , the Chinese people have struggled hard and won great victories in revolution for national liberation , founded the People 's Republic of China , scored tremendous achievements in socialist construction , especially in the cause of reform , opening up and the socialist modernization drive , constantly improved people 's living condition , and continuously raised international its position .  
Since the founding of New China , the economy and society have developed rapidly ; the country has become increasingly prosperous ; the people 's social status , living standards and cultural and educational level have risen markedly .  
In keeping with the economic , political and cultural requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , all comrades in the party and all people in the country should strive to achieve the development goals set for the Tenth Five-Year Plan . We should focus on development through economic restructuring and by relying on reform , opening up and scientific and technological progress with a view to improving people 's living standards and constantly pushing for economic growth and social progress .  
The party 's policy to get the population rich must be adhered to .  On the basis of economic growth , efforts should be made to increase income for urban and rural residents , constantly improve their living conditions , including food , clothing , housing , transport and daily necessities , improve the social security system , and medical and health facilities , with a view to bettering their life .  
It is implementing the reform and opening up policy that spurred the national economy to develop in a sustainable , rapid and healthy manner and raised the social and productive forces , overall national strength and people 's standard of living to higher levels .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that China and India are two biggest developing countries of the world .  Both of them face the tasks of developing the economy and improving the people 's living standard and need a peaceful and stable surrounding environment .  
On the basis of economic development and social progress , it is necessary to increase the income of urban and rural residents , continuously raise the people 's living standards and life quality , and continuously enable the people to gain better and solid economic , political , and cultural benefits .  
We have seen clearly that the poor level of productive forces is a major factor that determines people 's willingness in having children .  In view of this , China has worked out its population program and population policies that conform with reality , which have not only successfully ensured healthy development for the country 's population and family planning undertaking ; but has also served to promote the country 's economic growth , push forward social progress , improve the living standards of the people , and enhance the country 's comprehensive national strength .  
Under the strategic plan of " a small change every year , a medium change every three years and a big change by the year 2010 " put forward by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee , Guangzhou has devoted great efforts to the development and comprehensive improvement of its urban environment in its endeavor to provide its people with a more comfortable living environment .  
The foreign policy must serve the needs of domestic development : making the country strong and prosperous , developing the economy , and improving the living standard of the people .  
We have won the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games . This shows that the international community has acknowledged the fact that China is marked by social stability and progress , its economy is prospering , and its people are living a peaceful and comfortable life .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
In the more than 50 years since the founding of the PRC , especially in the more than 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the Chinese people , under the leadership of the CPC , have continued their advance along the road of development they chose themselves ; China 's economic strength , national defense capacities , and scientific and technological strength have greatly increased ; and the people 's standards of living have noticeably improved .  
We have laid down a plan for national economic and social development for the coming five years .  We will persistently take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal and continue to push forward reform , opening up , and the modernization drive .  
These units have also provided many good farming and breeding skills for Tibet residents without compensation .  These years , they have changed their assistance steps and methods in a timely manner .  They have depended on their farms and production bases and exploited their professional , technological , and equipment advantages to translate many research achievements into social productive forces , thus greatly promoting the development of society , the economy , and productive forces of Tibet as well as the improvement of people 's living standards .  
This is evidenced by , among other things , its increasingly rapid economic growth , significant improvement of its people 's living standards , remarkable achievements in its building of advanced socialist culture and ethics , and vigorous development of all its social undertakings .  
Although technology objectively has a negative impact on the environment , this negative viewpoint is basically a flimsy excuse .  With the economic development and the people 's understanding being raised to a higher and higher level , the people will make a higher and higher demand for a quality life and a healthy , comfortable environment .  This will basically restrict the living space of the technology featuring excessive exploitation of natural resources and will help promote the development of environmentally friendly technology .  
Raidi emphatically pointed out : Although the Western hostile forces have clung to their ambitious designs of splitting Tibet from China , and the task to fight against " Tibet independence " is still vary arduous , the autonomous regional government has confidence that it will overcome all obstacles , accelerate economic development and social progress in Tibet , and raise the people 's living standard .  
After the trials of training in high temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius and frigid cold of 30 degrees Celsius below zero ; after successively moving across Bohai , Donghai , Nanhai , and other sea areas ; after undergoing rigid training and roughing it out , the Navy Marines of our army have now found an operational program that is suitable for moving , eating , living , and fighting in all kinds of weathers and environments under the condition of modern warfare .  They have also mastered the skill of fighting in complicated regions .  
Yang Xueyi , associate research fellow of the " 18 September Historical Museum , " briefed that after the " 18 September Incident , " the Japanese aggressor troops engineered a series of atrocious massacres in Liaoning . On 16 September 1932 , the Japanese army carried out a barbarous policy of burning and killing .  About 3,000 innocent ordinary people living in the neighborhood of Pingding Shan in Fushun were killed and all the houses were burned down .  
Specifically speaking , it is necessary to create a rather positive working environment , a harmonious and agreeable environment of interpersonal relationships , an academic environment that is democratic and lively , a rather comfortable living environment , and a social environment that is respectful and understanding .  
Governments at all levels should show deep care for the people , always care about the well-being of the working masses living in difficult conditions , fully rely on the masses , rely on the community management organizations , do careful and meticulous work , find out the concrete conditions of the people living in difficult conditions , effectively arrange the necessary funds needed by the issuance of minimum livelihood allowances through adjusting the structure of financial revenue and expenditure .  
As far as the whole country is concerned , the primary task at present is to unswervingly implement the central authorities ' current social security policies and measures , do a really good job in the " two assurances " work , and ensure that the basic living needs of laid-off workers from state enterprises and the basic pensions of retired workers are paid on time and in sufficient amount ; we absolutely can not have new debts arising in this respect .  
Zhu Rongji said , the CPC Central Committee and State Council are very concerned for Guizhou 's economic and social development ; we hope that the provincial party committee and government will seriously implement General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's demands on " three represents , " and lead the people of all nationalities in the province to work with concerted efforts , engage in pioneering and innovation , and speed up the building of a beautiful new Guizhou with prosperous economy , social progress , and people of all ethnic groups living in harmony .  
It is a period of the CPC leading the Chinese people to instigate to materialize national prosperity and strength and shared prosperity among people during reforms and opening up to the outside world , to construct a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  The CPC has made great achievements that attracted worldwide attention during its modernization process , and remarkably raised the social productivity and overall national strength , the people 's social status , living standards and material and cultural level .  
Since the founding of New China , the economy and society have developed rapidly ; the country has become increasingly prosperous ; the people 's social status , living standards and material and cultural level have risen markedly .  
We must perceive the major political , economic , cultural , and science and technology changes that have taken place in the world since the publication of the " Communist Manifesto " 150 years ago ; we must perceive the major changes that have occurred in China 's socialist construction ; and we must perceive the major changes that have taken place in the working and living conditions and social environment of the party members , cadres , and masses .  
However , restricted by communications and telecommunication conditions , a vast number of farmers and herdsmen living in the remote mountainous areas and rural areas have been unable to accurately learn in a timely fashion the party 's and state 's principles and policies .  
However , it was utterly impossible for China , overwhelmed by a dark political situation and turmoil and chaos of war , with the masses living in dire poverty and in a miserable state , to catch up with the advanced trend of developing science and technology in the world .  
At a briefing to Chinese and foreign reporters today , Liu Hong , director of the State Statistics Bureau , said : In 1999 , China 's economy grew steadily ; the residents ' living standards continued to improve ; the financial , securities , and insurance industries were continuously standardized and developed ; social undertakings made new advances ; and environmental protection was further strengthened .  
On its economic and social fronts , China successfully met its preset targets for economic growth , its exports ceased to fall and began to pick up , its financial revenue enjoyed a stable growth , an increase was registered in the economic returns of state enterprises , and the living standards of the people are undergoing a continued improvement .  All these were remarkable work results that had attracted people 's attention .  
The implementation of the proactive fiscal policy has protected social stability , maintained the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy , and improved the people 's living standards although it has also increased deficits and debts .  
When asked about the current state of the boy designated by the Dalai as the " reincarnated soul boy " of the Panchen , Raidi said : The " reincarnated soul boy " of the Panchen proclaimed without authorization by the Dalai in 1995 is against religious rules and is illegal .  The boy is living a very happy life , is receiving education , and is growing up in a healthy manner .  He is now a primary school student .  
At this year 's " two sessions , " the government has proposed that " full consideration should be given to the people 's capability of adapting themselves to the reform while carrying out reforms , and the expenses originally borne by the state and social institutions can not be shifted to the people . "  The government has also emphasized that the basic living standards of the disadvantaged people should be guaranteed , and a social security system should be established and improved .  NPC deputies and CPPCC members have recognized this .  
In the past year , while developing its economy and improving the people 's standard of living , China has also attached great importance to building democracy and the legal system as well as to promoting and protecting civil and political rights .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .  
The current phenomena of inadequate effective demand and excess of some products and production capacities have emerged under the condition of low social productive forces and low overall living standards of the people .  
Under the support of the Central Government , Tibet has attained economic development and social progress .  Tibet has been improving its people 's living standards ; remarkably advanced its ethnic culture , education , and public health ;

At this year 's " two sessions , " the government has proposed that " full consideration should be given to the people 's capability of adapting themselves to the reform while carrying out reforms , and the expenses originally borne by the state and social institutions can not be shifted to the people . "  The government has also emphasized that the basic living standards of the disadvantaged people should be guaranteed , and a social security system should be established and improved .

The current phenomena of inadequate effective demand and excess of some products and production capacities have emerged under the condition of low social productive forces and low overall living standards of the people .  
Under the support of the Central Government , Tibet has attained economic development and social progress .  Tibet has been improving its people 's living standards ; remarkably advanced its ethnic culture , education , and public health ;  
The first group of county ( municipal ) " three stresses " educational work have the following special characteristics : First , through emphasis on taking hold of theoretical learning , in particular conscientiously learning Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important ideology of the " three represents " , leading cadres have received a rather systematic theoretical education .  Second , leading cadres are living in the villages and going into the households resulting in extensive arousal of the masses to action , introduction of the " three stresses " , and warm welcomes by the masses .  
In the more than 50 years since the founding of New China , especially in the 20-odd years since the start of reform and opening up , our country 's productive forces have developed rapidly , our overall national strength has noticeably increased , the people 's living standards have generally improved , the unity of nationalities has been continuously strengthened , social stability has prevailed , our country 's international prestige has steadily grown , and China has now become one of the countries which have developed fastest in the world .  
Nevertheless , with a guilty conscience , he did not dare to use expressions like " two countries " but carefully chose a neutral expression such as " the two sides of the Taiwan Straits . " He said that " the same historical experiences should have laid a solid foundation for the people living on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits to gain mutual understanding and commonly seek freedom , democracy , human rights , . .  
Relevant responsible comrades from the relevant departments under the State Council and from some provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , including Beijing , Hebei , Inner Mongolia , Liaoning , and Shaanxi , reported on their efforts to ensure the payment of old-age pensions to retirees and basic living allowances to laid-off workers .  They also set forth suggestions on further improving the social security system .  
Wei Jianxing pointed out : China and Indonesia , both important developing countries , are facing the same tasks of invigorating the economy , improving people 's standards of living , and safeguarding the just rights and interests of developing countries .  There exist enormous potential and a bright future for their cooperation in wide-ranging areas .  
No loopholes should be left in social security funds , the practice of " paying and allocating funds for the balance " of basic old-age insurance premiums must be resolutely put an end to , and the contributions of funds by society at large should be realized as soon as possible to ensure that basic living expenses for staff and workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and the old-age pensions for retirees are paid on time and in full .  
Beijing Municipality in recent years has achieved new vistas in revolution and liberalization , and its economic development is flourishing .  The standard of living of the people has been steadily rising , and there have been many positive changes in the face of the city , with more parks , green spaces , and beautification projects being undertaken .  The city 's air quality has also improved , opening the way for some new weather phenomena there .  
Countries differ in many ways , in their social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural heritage , economic development , standard of living , religious beliefs , and values .  Therefore , it is not possible to expect all countries to develop after a single model or system .  
With 10 percent of the global arable land , China has managed to meet the basic needs for food and clothing of its population , which is 22 percent of the global population .  The living standard of the urban and rural population is increasing steadily .  
In the past 50 years , the Chinese Government has not only basically provided enough food and clothing for 1.2 billion people and greatly raised the people 's living standards , but also allowed the people to enjoy civil , political , economic , social , cultural , and educational rights on the basis of the Constitution and law .  We can say that China 's current human rights situation is in the best period in history .  
Now , under the financial support of the central government , the Tibet autonomous region has experienced economic development unimaginable previously and the living standard of the people has been greatly raised .  
As everyone knows , the Korean Peninsula was divided by the international agreement into two independent countries that are not subordinate to each other .  They follow two different social systems , and their living standards also differ greatly .  However , both the North and the South are not opposed to the reunification in the future despite their differences in the " systems " and " living standards . "  
The government is extremely concerned about the establishment and perfection of a system of social security .  Last year , a total of 2.81 million urban residents received a minimum living benefit , for a total value of 1.969 billion yuan over 667 cities and 138 counties nationwide .  
The criteria for judging all party tasks should be whether they are conducive to liberating and developing the productive forces ; to reinforcing the comprehensive national strength of a socialist state ; and to raising the living standard .  
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
and improving the people 's living standard and safeguarding social stability .  With a conscientious and responsible attitude , we have implemented well the positive fiscal policies and worked hard to give play to the role of the treasury in macroregulation and control ;  
increased wages for personnel at institutions ; improved the three social security levels , namely basic living subsidies for laid-off workers at state enterprises , unemployment insurance , and minimum living allowance for city and town dwellers , and the treatment for retirees ; and paid retroactively overdue pensions to retirees at state enterprises in order to boost residents ' purchasing power and expand consumer demand .  
participating in the study and formulation of the scientific and rational social security payment standard and level to guarantee basic living subsidies , including pensions , the unemployment fund , and medical subsidies , for the object of social security and to meet the needs of the social security funding level ;  
Those who apply for judicial aid because they face financial harships or those who seek funds for basic living expenses should provide proof that the economic conditions of their own and their families are in conformity with the local government relevant departments ' stipulated standards for citizens ' economic difficulties .  
At present , we must make continued efforts to guarantee basic living expenses for staff and workers , who have been laid off by the state-owned enterprises , and must pay in full amount and on schedule both the old-age pension to retired personnel and the minimum living expenses to the urban residents .  We should more rapidly build or refine our social security system ; should build both an unemployment insurance system and an old-age insurance system for the staff and workers ;  
promote scientific , civil , progressive ideas and ways of production and living .  We must continue to bring the nation to a higher ideological , ethical , scientific , educational , and cultural level .  We must be disseminators of advanced Chinese culture .  
With the " Millennium World Peace Assembly " as the main topic , the seminar discussed questions of defusing conflicts , preserving peace , working at dialogue , promoting exchanges , eliminating poverty , protecting the environment , treasuring peace , and incorporating things of diverse nature ; they fully expressed the stance , views , and ideas of China 's religious and scholastic circles for preserving peace and creating a beautiful living space for mankind .  
With respect to external policy , he made great efforts to push the so-called " pragmatic diplomacy " to expand Taiwan 's " international living space , " promote Taiwan 's accession to the United Nations and other international organizations in order to seek Taiwan 's " international legal subject " and its " independent international person " status in a vain attempt to create " two Chinas , " or " one China , one Taiwan " in the world .  
The meeting maintained : During the Ninth Five-Year period , our army 's logistics construction and reform progressed in a comprehensive way , with key areas highlighted , and developed in a coordinated way ; while living an austere life , logistics officers and soldiers throughout the armed forces worked hard , made innovations while opening up new ground in work constantly , and accomplished something significant .  Hence , considerable progress was made in logistics construction .  
As China 's population has grown , the quality of people 's living standards has improved , economic and social development has quickened , and industrialization , urbanization , and agricultural modernization have speeded up , China 's water resources situation has become even worse , and contradictions between water supply and demand are becoming even more prominent .  So we must soberly realize the water problem .  
The aging population is the result of economic and social development , the rising living standard , and the improvement in medical and public health conditions ; it is an important indication of civilization and social progress .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized : All the work of the party and the state is for the fundamental purpose of satisfying the people 's daily increasing needs in their material and cultural life and improving their living standards .  
A major task to expedite the development of minority nationality areas is to vigorously train minority nationality cadres of various levels , improve their political and cultural expertise , enable them to guide the economic development of minority nationality areas , and educate and guide , through these cadres , the masses of minority nationalities to change their ideas and to concentrate on developing production , improving living condition , casting off poverty , and becoming rich .  
We should learn from him his fine work style of seeking truth from facts , being humble and prudent and living a plain and frugal life , persisting in going deep into the realities of life to conduct investigations and studies , cementing close ties with the masses , wholeheartedly serving the people , and consciously and properly playing his role as a public servant .  
We should learn from him his fine style of seeking truth from facts , being modest and prudent , and hard work and plain living .  We should persist in going deep into the realities of life , carry out investigation and study , maintain close ties with the masses , serve the people wholeheartedly , and consciously be good public servants of the people .  
its industrial structure under went gradual readjustments ; social undertakings in areas such as science and technology , education , culture , and health made considerable progress ; the people 's living standards improved unceasingly ; and the relations of equality , unity , and mutual help between different ethnic groups have been further consolidated .

Tibet 's culture has acquired new contents of the times and is advancing forward .  The criticism of " extinction of the Tibetan culture " essentially requires the Tibetan people of the present day to completely keep the way of living and the value of culture under the feudal serfdom in old Tibet .

China 's economic successes are universally acknowledged , and it has steadily improved the living standards of its people , increased its national strength and significantly boosted its international standing , he noted .  
The most fundamental experience in achieving tremendous successes in reform and opening up in the past 20 years and more is that at all time and under all circumstances , we have regarded whether or not what we are doing conforms with the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people as the highest standard in all our work , and have regarded meeting the growing needs of the material and cultural life of the people and improving the living standards of the people as the most important task .  
About 60 percent of them were special impoverished population : Some of them had lost the ability to work , being either disabled people or recipients of social security benefits relying on family support and societal relief ; the rest of them were living in very inclement and adverse environments and lacked the basic conditions for production and living , thus requiring relocation and resettlement .

The practice in the construction of our country has also proved that if the productive forces develop slowly , it will be difficult to resolve various kinds of contradictions and problems exiting in economic and social life , and it will also be difficult to meet the people 's demands for improving their living standard .

This will be conducive not only to improving the peasants ' living standards and stabilizing the situation in the rural areas but also to exploiting rural markets and bringing about a sound interaction between industry and agriculture and between the urban and rural economies and a coordinated development of all of them .  
With the constant improvement in people 's material and cultural living standards , various social sectors have a growing demand for commemorative gold and silver coins .  In the meantime , they are eager to acquire knowledge about commemorative coins and the relevant marketing and management systems .

With the unremitting efforts over a long time , the Chinese people 's living standard has been unprecedentedly improved and the human rights and basic freedoms they enjoy have been raised to an unprecedented high level .  The human rights situation has reached its best period in history and this is a fact obvious to all .  
The committee members pointed out : With the successful fulfillment of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , our nation has basically solved the issue of providing sufficient food and clothing for the 1.3 billion people throughout the country , and the living standards of the people in the main have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  Our nation has accomplished the two historic changes from poverty to getting sufficient food and clothing , and then from getting sufficient food and clothing to enjoying a comparatively better-off life .  
The proposal adopted by the CPC Central Committee for formulating the 10th Five-Year Plan disclosed this important information : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , China will take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic starting point . 
Through the formulation and implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , China will be able to better adjust its own pace of development , release the initiative of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , concentrate all efforts on the theme of " development , " and advance toward the strategic objective of building a moderately developed socialist country and enhancing the people 's living standards so that they are able to lead a fairly comfortable life .  
Today , when the 10th Five-Year Plan is formulated , the framework of a socialist market economy has been initially set up , the concept of building a market economy has struck deep roots in the hearts of people , the living standards of our people have basically reached a moderately high level , the supply of most commodities has exceeded their demand , economic globalization has become a major trend , China 's accession to the WTO is just round corner , and international competition is becoming increasingly acute .  
The four other guiding principles are taking the structural readjustment as the main thread , making reform and opening up and scientific and technical progress as the motive power , improving the living standards of the general public as the starting point , and persisting in a coordinated economic and social development .  
In considering the strategic arrangements and important measures for the reform , opening up , and modernization , it is imperative to regard development as the theme , structural adjustment as the principal line , the reform and opening up and advancement in science and technology as the driving forces , and the improvement of the people 's living standard as the fundamental point of departure .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : To implement the strategy for the extensive development of the west country , it not only requires plain living and hard struggle on the part of the broad ranks of cadres and masses in the west country over a long period of time , but also calls for energetic support from the people of the whole nation , especially of the eastern regions .

certain headway has been attained in the undertakings of welfare , health care , culture , education , and sports for the elderly ; and both the living standards and the life quality of the old have been improved on a constant basis .  All these progresses and achievements attained in the work towards the aged are now playing an important part in pushing forward the economic construction and social development of our country .  
Active efforts should be made to study and explore new forms and new methods for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work among the elderly under the present new situation , and to carry out the ideological and political work among the elderly in a practical , flexible , thoroughgoing , and meticulous manner , so that the great majority of old people can enjoy a colorful , healthy , and civilized way of living in their remaining years .  
Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .

He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
It calls for acting in line with the requirements of the " three represents , " attaching prime importance to resolving relevant issues related to people 's immediate interests , including striving to increase the incomes of urban and rural residents , especially low-income people in the urban areas and the incomes of peasants .  It also calls for expanding employment , improving the social security system , optimizing the consumption environment , raising the quality of living , and resolving the food and clothing problems of those people who are still living in poverty .  
The main reasons for China to increase its national defense spending this year is to ensure that the living standard of the servicemen will improve simultaneously with social and economic development and with the increase in the average income of urban and rural residents , and to meet the needs of the modernization of national defense and the reform of the military management structure .  
According to actual conditions , we must understand and grasp the theme of accelerating development , actively make structural readjustment with the stress on development , do a good job in making institutional and scientific and technological innovations , two major driving forces , and eventually use these driving forces for improving the people 's living standards .  
I believe that in the course of implementing the Tenth Five-Year Plan and realizing the third strategic objective in the new century , minority areas can seize the opportunity afforded by the great development of the west to speed up economic development and social progress and raise the living standard of the minority nationalities so as to gradually bring about the common development and joint prosperity of all nationalities . "  
Like the whole country , over the past five years , Jiangsu scored brilliant achievements in its economic and social development , and on the whole the province completely attained the goal of enabling its people to live a relatively comfortable life with the county as a unit and realized a historical leap from just having sufficient food and clothing to living a relatively comfortable life .  Southern Jiangsu and some areas along the Chang Jiang have started ahead of time to stride toward the third-step strategic goals .  
The second is that the means of management are different .  The reemployment service centers of enterprises are in charge of the workers of the state-owned-enterprises who are removed from their work place , including the issuance of basic living expenses and paying of social insurance fees on behalf of the workers ; whereas socialized management is applied to the unemployed personnel .  
We should fully implement various policies set by the party Central Committee and correctly handle relations between reform , development and stability .  We should place the task of increasing people 's standard of living in an important place , and consolidate and develop the good trend of economic growth .  We should promote a sustained , rapid and health development of the national economy and all-round social progress , and achieve a good beginning of the " 10th Five-Year Plan . "  
Deputy Raidi from the Tibet delegation noted : The reason why Tibet has attained such a rapid economic growth and social progress is that the people of all ethnic groups in the region are living together in unity and harmony , and this has given rise to a stable social environment .  Tibet 's development over the past many years serves to show clearly that unity and stability are a prerequisite for development .  
Once the railway is built and operational , it will : further the economic and social development of Tibet and raise the people 's standard of living ; put Tibet in better economic and cultural contact with its brother provinces , autonomous regions and directly-administered municipalities ; bring the various ethnic groups closer together ;  
In the course of making great development in western areas and implementing the Tenth Five-Year Plan , it is necessary to further consolidate the unity of all ethnic groups , promote comprehensive social and economic development , and strive to enhance the living standards of the masses .  In the course of economic development , attention should be paid to bring local advantages into better play .  
Looking ahead , we have now finished drawing our blueprint : to double the 2000 GDP by 2010 , make more affluent the people living in moderate prosperity , and form a relatively complete and sound socialist market economic system ;  
What is different from the previous plans is that the 10th Five-Year Plan regards raising the living standard of the broad masses as a basic point of departure .  It embodies the alignment of national planning with the people 's livelihood and is a plan that fully reflects General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents . "  
We will not merely stay at the growth of per capita income but , more importantly , make efforts in numerous areas including the consumption structure , living environment , social security , public services , medical treatment and healthcare , spiritual demands , and so on so that the material , spiritual , and cultural demands of the vast number of people are satisfied as much as possible , and their quality in life is improved .  
Under the conditions of reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , party cadres must make greater effort to build up their party spirit , adopt a correct attitude toward power , position , interests , have the ability to resist the corrosive influence of various decadent ideas , and set a good example in working hard , living thriftily , and performing official duties honestly and uncorruptly .  
Ours is a big developing country with a population of nearly 1.3 billion , where the level of economic and social development and the people 's living standards are still rather low ; in such a situation , our country also has a tremendous demand potential and very vast market space .  
We are now embarking upon a major upgrade and expansion of our already excellent railway service , to relieve pressure on congested lines and to bring fast , cheap and efficient transport to those living in new urban areas .  
" It is inappropriate and often misleading to describe the actual change in households ' well-being without taking into account the various welfare provisions by the Government including free-subsidised education service , low cost public housing , free medical care , retraining and other government subvented welfare services all of which contribute to improving the living standard of the disabled , the elderly , the single parents and the low income households , " the spokesman added .

The exhibition materials included photographs , video-tapes , and model display on environmental protection activities such as waste reduction , environmental hygiene , healthy living style among students , etc .  
To meet this objective , we may need to consider steering away from the past approach in which urban renewal had been conducted in a piecemeal manner .  Instead , we will plan urban renewal and rehabilitation more comprehensively for larger areas , with a view to more effectively restructuring and re-planning the old urban areas , re-designing a more effective and environmentally friendly transport and road network , replacing incompatible land uses , adding open space , and designing buildings which meet the demands of modern living .  
" We realize that we are to retain our large and influential international community in Hong Kong , and continue to attract the best brains and skills from overseas , then we will need to offer a lifestyle that promises not just commercial stimulation and ample reward for hard work and enterprise but a pleasant and enjoyable living environment as well . "  
But over these eighty years , sweeping changes have taken place in our country , which we are all proud to see .  China has evolved from a country plagued by foreign invasion and domestic upheavals to a stable and peaceful nation exercising the rule of law , from a backward and isolated country to a nation that has opened up and become stronger through the promotion of science and technology , and from a poverty-stricken country to a nation with a rising standard of living .

However , for those secondary school students who live in the Islands District , which covers an extensive area , the time required for travelling to some secondary schools within their school net but distant from their places of residence is often longer than that required for travelling to schools in an adjacent school net .  For example , it takes more time for students living in Tung Chung of Lantau Island to go to secondary schools on Ping Chau and Cheung Chau than to those in Tsing Yi , Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan .  
Over a period of 50 years in the second half of the 20th century , our country has made remarkable progress in industry , agriculture , technology , national defence and education .

China 's earliest royal dynasty - the Xia dynasty ( 2070-1600BC ) - first established its capital in the Henan region and during the subsequent 3,300 years more than 20 dynasties established their capitals in Henan Province . The large quantity of archaeological finds demonstrate that as early as 400,000 or 500,000 years ago humans were living in the Central Plains area and at some time between 7,000 and 9,000 years ago agricultural production had made its beginnings there during the period of Peiligang culture ( c . 7000X5000BC ) .  
Having carefully considered the request of the Staff Side of SCSC , the Chief Executive is of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that in determining the size of each year 's civil service pay adjustment , the Government takes into account the following factors : the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale .  
Some of the considerations under the existing mechanism such as the net pay trend indicators and the cost of living are capable of upward and downward movements .  It is thus inherent in our annual pay adjustment policy and mechanism that civil service pay may be increased or decreased .  
" The Chief Executive is of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that in determining the size of each year 's civil service pay adjustment , the Government takes into account the following factors : the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale .

The rapid advancement in recent years has created great wealth for the people , bringing remarkable improvement to their living environment .  
But most importantly , someday the Earth will be threatened by resources depletion , asteroid impacts or abrupt changes of solar activities .  Human will be forced to leave the Earth and find a new home in the endless Universe . To prepare for the challenges ahead , we need to understand the effects of prolonged weightlessness and living in confined environment on human 's physiology and psychology .

The main objective of our activities is to provide Hong Kong people educated overseas with up-to-date information on Hong Kong , in particular a better understanding on the local job market , the new opportunities opening up as a result of further integration with the Pearl River Delta Region , and the continuously improving living conditions here .  
( iii ) The " Team Clean " headed by the Chief Secretary for Administration announced last week , as Phase I of the team 's work , a wide range of firm and decisive measures to promote good personal and public hygiene and tackle the environmental hygiene black spots .  These measures will produce quick and visible improvements in our living environment .  
Because of our economic construction in recent years , the average family income has increased sharply . The general living standard has risen and the gap between the rich and the poor has narrowed .  
The Taipei Waterworks also is working to improve the quality of the water and to elevate the water pressure . ( 8 ) Sewer Construction : The main task is to build underground sewers and to keep water flowing so that the citizens can have a more wholesome living environment . ( 9 ) Education : Taipei has many schools with high standards . There are 23 universities and colleges , 100 secondary ( high ) schools , 116 primary ( elementary ) schools and 172 kindergartens within the city .  
The Republic of China government has taken all steps possible in recent years toward improving the people 's living conditions and helping them solve their housing problems . The goal is to have every individual in society leading a stable , happy life in the shelter of a warm , attractive home .  
The village , established six years ago in Taoyuan in northern Taiwan , has 16 houses each equipped with modern amenities and run by a trained and well-educated nurse who acts as a surrogate mother for the orphans living in her charge . The children not only regard her as " mother " but also look upon each other as brothers and sisters .  
At first , people were skeptical over his intentions , since with the improving living conditions in Taiwan , beggars and private garbage collectors were becoming part of history . But despite this problem , and the rheumatism and neurasthenia that afflicted him , he continued to work until he had won the support and understanding of the public , and even his health improved .  
Topics covered included improving the aborigines ' living standards , dredging waterways in Er Chung to prevent floods , strengthening communications with people at the basic level , and stabilizing prices of agricultural products .  
Because crabs need constant supervision , their culture is not an easy task . The supply of snails for their diet is also limited . But as standards of living have risen , and seafood restaurants have become more popular , crab farmers are assured of a handsome profit .  
Story of a Small Town Mountains covered with fir woods and bamboo groves , frequently shrouded by mists and sharply divided by the sparkling Chingshui River , provide an idyllic setting for Tsaoling Village in central Taiwan . Its pastoral people , who earn their living through a resourceful array of specialized products , help further to induce an atmosphere of rural peace .  
As a result , the Chinese lost a considerable part of one of their most priceless heritages . Today , however , as standards of living in the Republic of China have improved , the flow is being reversed . Many people in Taiwan are interested in collecting antiques , and have laid out large sums of money to bring these valuable ceramics " back home . "  
A New , Clean Deal for Taiwan Rapid industrialization in Taiwan has brought with it the inevitable bane of advanced countries everywhere - - pollution . Improved living standards associated with the economic advance have made matters worse by increasing the number of motor vehicles .  
About 300 years ago , the first migrations of Chinese to Taiwan began . The new arrivals struggled to make a living , but faced many unexpected natural calamities . Taiwan is on the earthquake belt , it is also afflicted by typhoons , and because its climate is tropical or subtropical , disease was more rampant .  
These will be surrounded by an agricultural zone which in turn is surrounded by a protected area where development is prohibited . Upon completion it is projected that the new city will have a population of 450,000 . It will be a total living environment where people can work , live and relax .  
They asked her to raise her left hand if she wanted to marry the rich and ugly son living to the east , and to raise her right hand if she wanted to marry the handsome , but poor son living to the west .  
They do n't just want to cover their bodies from the elements but also to express themselves in clothing . So as living standards increase , the textile industry is going to be more promising . The industry has a strong base , so long as the industry people are not convention-bound and they emphasize research and development leading to high quality products .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
While living in the United States , Chang discovered this stone , shaped like the island of Taiwan , and placed it in his garden in Los Angeles . Later , when he came to Taiwan , he had it shipped over especially for his garden . On the stone are carved the two characters " Plum Hill , " executed by the master 's own hand .  
Market trends in Europe and the U . S . this year show that older people are buying ceramic dolls to pass on to the younger generation . International demand for gift items , steadily increasing apace of world population growth and improved living standards , has led to the development of worldwide gift industries . Advanced nations often phase out their production of small gifts in favor of larger , technical and high profit items .  
The rapidly rising standard of living in the Republic of China has led to the increasing diversification of life for its citizens . As options increase , the average citizen becomes busier - - previous chores become more difficult to accomplish as a greater proportion of time is spent engaged in differing activities .  
Later , an incarnation of Chang Hsun came looking for an appropriate site for a temple and settled on Anhsifu . A local official inspected the area and felt that the cave there would produce phoenixes , an omen meaning that someone living in the area was destined to become famous . The phoenixes , therefore , must not be allowed to escape , and the official ordered that a stone pillar be placed on the " phoenix 's wing . "

A 1984 survey conducted by the Executive Yuan discovered that the vast majority of people questioned were dissatisfied with their living environment . More over , 59 percent considered protecting the environment more important than pursuing economic development .  
In the first , murderers and brigands are tied to a bronze pole filled with fire . The second contains Blade Mountain . Here those who blasphemed the Buddha or wantonly killed living creatures are forced to climb naked up a mountain of innumerable sharp swords . Punished in the last level , the hell of freezing cold , are husband-killers , adulterers , the unfilial , and those who urged others to gamble .  
" Taiwan 's economic progress over the past thirty or more years has raised living and educational standards and increased the desire of the populace to participate in politics . This , together with other changing objective conditions , has made ' lifting martial law ' and ' opening up the formation of new political parties ' a natural decision , " says government spokesman Chang King-yuh .  
Maintaining trade secrets is vital to high-technology industries , and so the park enforces tight security . People entering and leaving are checked for identification , and the park forms something of an independent living space separated from Hsinchu proper , with its own residences , activity center , athletic field , swimming pool , library , school , and so forth .  
These observations coincide closely with records concerning saris in the Buddhist scriptures . " The article went on to explain that " the reasons for the formation of gallstones can be hereditary , or one 's natural physical constitution , while the majority stem from a lack of physical excercise , a build-up of bile in the gallbladder , or irregular eating habits . . . . The late Hsin Jung vanished into monastic life at the age of sixteen and spent 32 years living as a monk .  
It was a residential building with no sign in front , butno mistakethis was the Yang Ming Woodcarving Co . The scene inside was typical of a family workshop : a wooden ship displayed in a cabinet in the living room , carved wooden masks hanging from the walls , various kinds of wooden athletic equipment stacked in the corners . . . only not a trace of a sword in sight .  
Master Sheng-yen has two explanations for the turnabout . First , at a time when contemporary man 's living space grows ever smaller and social tensions ever greater , Buddhism offers people explanations for the flux around them and a limitless spiritual space to roam in . And second , as people rise in educational level , they gain a new understanding of Buddhism which they find more acceptable .  
Ho Te-hong , Chairman of the Forestry BureauThe Taiwan Forestry Bureau is like the eldest brother or sister in a family who earned money to support their younger brothers or sisters . And after their living standard improved , the younger brothers and sisters , now having grown up , turn around and reject their elder brother or sister , viewing them as good-for nothings or saying that their former jobs were not prestigious enough . When our nation was poor the Taiwan Forestry Bureau struggled to keep our heads above water .  
This has received attention because : ( a ) The proportion of the elderly in the population has increased ; they hope to continue to study and fill out their lives . ( b ) People demand satisfaction in their spiritual lives as the standard of living rises . ( c ) Constant technological change requires opportunities for continuing education .  
To use wooden fish to temper one 's mind has a very symbolic meaning . The never-sleeping eyes tell us that Buddhist cultivation is limitless and that the cleansing process is endless . The masters living in the tranquil temple purify their inner selves day and night . What about we who remain in the material world ?  
The attention of our people will gradually shift from the enjoyment of things and material well-being to the more refined and spiritual side of life , and people will stress quality rather than quantity . More emphasis will be put on enjoying life , on sampling quality products , on moving into the more rarefied atmosphere of high-class and well-designed living quarters , at the same time reaching into the top echelons of fashion - - all within the ethos of traditional Chinese culture .  
Because the legal requirement for twelve years of compulsory education has been set , the extremely tough competition for vacancies in a restricted number of pre-college institutions will gradually relax its stranglehold . This will give students and educators more leeway to pursue a balanced development of aesthetic skills and the capacity for aesthetic appreciation , coupled with the social graces needed for community living . Within colleges and universities , a well-rounded education will make up the deficiencies of an unbalanced curriculum and give due attention to the humanities .  
Science and the fruits of science will be harmoniously integrated with human life . The modernity and completeness of its public facilities will actively promote a well-rounded existence which is pluralistic in both inspiration and application . The result will not only enhance our international image , but it will also turn us into a model of what modern living should be like . .  
For European diplomats of his generation , fluency in fifteen languages and the experience of living in places like Batavia , the Hague , Tokyo , Chungking , Washington , New Delhi , Beirut , Damascus , and Kuala Lumpur would n't be considered extraordinary perhaps , but his illustrious " amateur careers " are downright astonishing . He was a musician , instructed in the Chinese lute as a young man by the master Yeh Shih-meng .  
At the same time , the government should also thoroughly implement ecological protection and prevention of public hazards , while improving traffic , public safety , and living environment conditions . In this way the people will not only have access to plentiful resources for their everyday life , but will also enjoy a rich and meaningful spiritual life , thus thoroughly realizing the ideals of prosperity and equitable distribution of wealth as prescribed in our Principle of the People 's Well-Being .  
These two legends , which are almost identical in content , tell of a pious woman ( actually Ksitigharbha in a previous existence ) whose earthly mother often killed living things and committed sinful deeds .  
With the influx of these high-level new immigrants , the image of Chinese Americans , who had been described as " smelling half of ginger and half of detergent " ( because many of them earned a living by running restaurants or laundries ) , changed completely overnight .  
Because the old Chinatowns , crowded and filthy , with their restaurants and souvenir shops , are located in the heart of city , Peter Kwong calls Chinese Americans living there " downtown Chinese " in distinction to " uptown Chinese , " who are professionals , drive nice cars and live in the suburbs .  
For many Taiwan businessmen , these conditions are lax and lenient , not to mention such advantageous factors as the countries ' spacious living environment , their rich natural resources , temperate climate and relative proximity to Taiwan . According to a survey by the Institute of Ethnology at Academia Sinica , Australia now stands even with the United States as the most alluring land of milk and honey for potential emigrants from Taiwan , and New Zealand ranks number five .  
With English as its official language , obviating the need to learn another foreign language , along with its relative proximity to Taiwan , its similarity in climate and its spacious and comfortable living environment , Australia makes for a highly competitive choice .  
While government breeding efforts have tended to concentrate on basic cereals such as rice and wheat , economic growth and rising living standards have brought increased consumer demand for high-profit horticultural products like flowers and fruit . Farmers now devote more growing area to these , new varieties are being introduced , and private-sector involvement in variety development is on the rise .  
We spoke frankly , I watched the meeting and the election , and I attended the dinner . The piece de resistance was the seminar I chaired . The discussion revolved around living in a foreign land , coming to terms with the new land and the old , where the future of China was headed and so forth . Everyone talked in full confidence , unable to stop , and the seminar did n't break up until one o'clock at night .  
Whether or not a program being planned to pass on traditional performing arts to the younger generation becomes a reality will depend on receiving a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development . It 's worth noting that Yang Hsiu-ching and Yang Tzai-hsiung , a husband-and-wife team that has won a National Heritage Award for their achievements in Taiwanese shuo-ch'ang ( a form of popular entertainment featuring singing and comic dialogue ) and is considered a town treasure , have moved back to Hsichih after living elsewhere for many years .  
Highly experienced editor Liao Chingsung , who has worked with all the new directing talent , remarks : " Society was just entering a better off phase , and with basic living requirements taken care of the audiences wanted to have more information . " The new directors were on the scene to present social and historical aspects hitherto ignored or considered taboo , at the same time as providing something for the new urban middle classes to spend their money on and talk about .  
Another unique national treasure in the Tatachia Area is the Formosan Salamander . These nocturnal amphibian tailed creatures are scattered in mountains above two thousand meters , living under damp , dark rocks or fallen trees .  
Yang Ming-chao says , " Our environment is getting worse day by day . The river water and soil are enduring heavy pollution . The standard of living is low , and we are cut off from the outside . Our public works are backward , and no one is willing to come and invest .  
Because the purpose of the garden is to display all kinds of plant life , and it has been operated for almost 100 years , the trees are tall and vigorous , the floor beneath the trees is damp and dark , and people are prohibited from walking in certain areas . Added to all this , there is a rippling pond . This is the equivalent to manufacturing an optimal environment for living things . "  
We reached a particularly steep stretch of the path and my legs grew weary . Only a few slanting rays of sunlight managed to pierce the broad canopies of the enormous trees scattered about both sides of the path - - the forest 's parasol . The world under this living umbrella was a moist and luxuriant green realm of nameless grasses and strange insects that flew up whenever one disturbed them . It was a timeless , carefree world under the care of the mountain .  
It would be nice if Chinese living overseas could share more of what they have learned with each other , especially French cuisine , which is world famous - - I expect that French cooking is more attractive than jus cheese and salads . As for oysters , judging from my many years of experience work ing in a hospital , it 's best to eat them cooked instead of raw .  
Shih Tsui-feng feels that , apart from the fortunate few who have their own homes , most modern urbanites are hard put to share their cramped living spaces with the traditional New Year 's couplets , but he says , " Still , even if it 's just a single character , such as ' Spring ' or ' good fortune ' - - hung upside down - - it 's always nice to hang something that adds a little holiday spirit and traditional flavor to the season . "  
Originally many of the Chinese in Singapore were illiterate and had inferiority complexes , which were aggravated by their living in an international port like Singapore where English was paramount . They broke their backs working so their children could study abroad .  
For me and many other overseas Chinese living here , Taipei is such a distant place that it 's hard to sense what it must be like , how it 's changed from quiet and tranquility to bustling crowds and prosperity . Life here is a matter of constantly doing our utmost to realize ourselves and raise our oppressed status . It 's just like that passage in " Chinese ?  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
The rapid development of technology has resulted in a gap between the living standards of the highly industrialized countries and the underdeveloped countries . As a result , the 1.2 billion people in the advanced industrial countries consume seven-eighths of the resources . And the four billion residents of the " Third World " are faced with hunger in many areas . This is also a topic that those involved in science and technology ought to consider .  
I 'm sure the reason many overseas students go bad or give up on themselves is that they 're afraid of being unable to live up to their parents ' expectations , combined with the stress of living overseas and the pressure of getting ahead academically .  
For example , the National Association for the Spinal Cord Injured of the Republic of China plans to spend three years to build a spinal injury refuge center , capable of accepting 1,000 people , in Hsinchu . The entire living and working environment is geared to the needs of the severely handicapped , so that they can find solace , and go on to receive occupational training and work in the refuge factory .  
Due to the binding of clan ties and the manpower required by farming , not only has it not been altered , but its original three-sided courtyard building has seen the addition of 13 auxiliary hu-lung ( protective dragon ) buildings at its sides , creating living space for a clan of some 200 families in two blocks .  
Besides the hardware and shape , traditional ho-yuan also extolled a natural , layered and shifting spacial notion . Could this be applied in a vital , living way to modern architecture ?  
The ancestral home , in use for four generations , was thus levelled overnight . For the older generation who are accustomed to living in the ho-yuan , there are psychological obstacles in making the leap into a tall building in a single bound .  
Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide . He argues that in the two hundred years since the industrial revolution , the large-scale use of non-recyclable materials by mankind has allowed modern people to enjoy the same standard of living as an ancient emperor attended by 200 servants .  
Only the application in daily life of ideals c allow even more people to participate , so that everyone will realize that environmental protection is n't so difficult . One need only make a few adjustments in one 's basic living habits to be able to change the environment . The basic view of green consumption is the admonition : " Do n't avoid doing something just because the gain seems small ; do n't go ahead and do something just because the harm seems marginal . "  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
But because those who have left find themselves in a strange environment and often adapt poorly , this creates even greater pressures . Forty-nine-year-old Chiu Chin-shih , who has spent half his life on the plain studying , living , and working , uses his own experience as an example : If an aborigine is competing with someone else for a job , unless one is extremely outstanding and the only one qualified , if it 's a situation where only one guy is going to get hired , they wo n't take the aborigine .  
I particularly enjoy its bilingual format as it helps me to better my knowledge of the written Chinese language . One of my favorite sections is " Overseas Reports . " I am a second-generation ethnic Chinese , born and bred in New Zealand . I have a keen interest in Chinese living in other parts of the world , and Sinorama gives a fascinating account of fellow Chinese in some very surprising countries .  
An irreplaceable part of modern living : CFCs have many advantages . They are non-toxic , odorless , cheap , stable , non-combustible , and non-corrosive . They are also easy to put to use , and do not leave polluting residues on the surface environment .  
During the warm period prior to the ice age , which is to say at the same time that the Han Chinese legend of Hou Yi ( who shot down nine of the ten suns with his bow and arrow ) was said to take place , the Taiya version has it that another sun appeared in the sky . There were two suns , one above and one below , so that the distinction between day and night was lost . The weather became oppressively hot , and illnesses spread rampantly ; all living things faced extinction .  
The faces of Buddhist Statues are mass produced in plastic ; the frames for final resting places are carved by machines and are ragged ; and course paper is used for the ceremonial spirit house , " says Master Hsu , angry about the superficiality of the living . As for whether the place where the deceased reside in the afterlife will leak water or collapse , that is of course part of the gap between this and the other world , and there is nothing anyone can do about it .  
Today , agricultural villages are in a period of transition . The elderly are not accustomed to living with their children in the crowded cities , and they 're unwilling to live in old folk 's homes . If old trees and the environments around them can be preserved , the villages can remain semi-agricultural , the elderly will have places to go , and their spiritual needs will be taken care of , too .  
The Taiwan Strait is no more than 100 meters deep at its deepest part ; if more silt is washed down from the mountains than is carried away by the sea , the surplus is deposited along the two coasts , and more is paid in than withdrawn . Thus the land spreads outwards in the same way that living cells ceaselessly grow and multiply . In this way , with the passing of the seasons , new land appeared from the sea , the western plain was formed , and the Lanyang Plain was born .  
Confined to modern living spaces , most domestically-raised hawks look more like homeless puppies , " sitting listlessly in a tiny room , with sparse and thin feathers , always nervous and alert and ready to strike , but finding themselves tied down and unable to fly . "  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
Chen Kuan-cheng explains that the typical European and American social security system is an intergenerational transfer of benefits , which is to say that the living expenses of the current elderly are paid by the current young and middle aged . When the current young become the seniors , the next generation will pay the bills .  
As far back as the time of the prehistoric matriarchal society , the primitive people living in the Yellow River valley had begun to keep dogs . Dogs were the first domestic animals to be reared by humans , and were not only intimately involved in people 's daily lives on a prac tical level , but were also an indispensable part of life on the spiritual plane .  
Painter Kuo Chen-chang used Western pop art techniques , with rough black lines and bright , beautiful colors , to tell the Chinese myth of Kua Fu , who died trying to reach the sun . His work is a metaphor for pitiable modern people in their endless quest to make a living .  
Except for a thin stretch of western Taiwan 's coastline settled by Chuanchow and Changchow Fukienese and a few Pingpu indigenous peoples , Shen was welcomed only by deep , forbidding mountains . The Han Chinese living on the coast called these " Fanshan , " or " savage mountains . "  
Taiwan 's history is not all centered on the Western plains . The aboriginal peoples have been living here for thousands of years . " He says that human activity in Taiwan has a vertical distribution from ancient to modern times and from high to low . Even the highest mountains show traces of human presence .  
At that time it was specially stipulated in the land reform law that the houses of overseas Chinese were acquired through their efforts abroad . Except for those houses that were rented out and definitely involved " exploitation " and which had to undergo " national reform , " the government could not confiscate those houses in which the families of overseas Chinese were living or those rented out which did not exceed 150 square meters .  
We saw old women who were living proof of the traditional model , mature women caught at the crossroads of tradition and contemporary society , and women who have crossed the historical divide and are actively creating their own space for the " new generation . "  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
In the films , Bruce Lee played such roles as a student in a martial arts training school in one of the foreign concessions in the early years of the Republic of China , or a lonely Chinese expatriate going to Southeast Asia or the West to try and make a living . Faced with inevitable bullying and insults from Westerners and Japanese , he would endure their repeated taunts , suppressing his anger until he could yield no further and all his pent-up ire would burst out .  
As international boundaries become increasingly blurred and the global village becomes a reality , working or living overseas no longer seems unusual . Yet families divided in this way have to confront the risk of dramatic upheaval or even disintegration .  
And you may make more money if you are lucky , or less money if you are not , but if spousal relations are not good , everything else is just meaningless . Structural problems must be solved conceptually : " I most dread hearing people say that they feel very proud of the fact that their wife lives in the United States and that their children go to school there . " Chien says that things will turn out well only if both parties realize that living apart is not a normal condition .  
But because not all fishes ' fins have the " honor " of being one of the " eight treasures , " no other fish can help sharks spread their risk . For sharks ' situation is just the opposite of other fish , whose flesh is dear but whose fins are cheap . In the past the market for shark meat was never well " developed , " and this led to the tragedy of sharks having the fins cut from their living bodies and being thrown back into the sea .  
The imposing Presidential Palace 's forbidden places are no longer unapproachable . The Presidential Palace does not combine working space and living quarters as do the White House or Buckingham Palace , which can reveal markedly different styles of interior design through the deliberate arrangement of chambers and gardens by the successive occupants . Nevertheless , for the average citizen , the Presidential Palace holds its own unique charisma .  
" Thus someone living in Harbin would be So-and-so Harbin , " he says by way of illustration . The Ching emperor Chien Lung ( 1736-1796 ) decided that the surname-less Jurchen consequently fell into rampant incestuous marriages . Only after a long period did fixed clan names evolve . The names of the eight Manchurian tribes were first recorded and explained in the Complete Record of the Family Names of the Eight Banners , so it was only from this time forward that the Jurchen had a relatively well-ordered system of family names .  
It is true that the brook masu salmon have survived from ancient times , and they are internationally famous as Taiwan 's precious living fossils . But still , in the greater context of the incessant deterioration of Nature , these fish are not the only creatures who ultimately are finding it difficult to escape extinction . And at the same time , how much hope remains as the salmon struggle against the manmade " New Nature " ?  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
In order to accommodate the living habits of the village 's Saisiyat residents , Wu thought of incorporating the short spirit ceremony into the dance , and with that in mind in 1994 he specially attended the biannual ceremony at Sky Lake , where he taped the entire thing . He also spent time off from work to visit with Saisiyat elders and the parents of the students in order to get a firm grip on the meaning behind the ceremony .  
For instance , some people like to take fish spears underwater to catch fish . This not only results in a reduction of that species , but also affects the local food chain , or it forces fish schools to swim farther out to sea . Try to avoid disturbing the ecology . Also , many divers trample on soft coral or move pieces of stony coral , so that the algae and other organisms living on them die .  
But today , when there is a greater emphasis on morality and humane treatment of other living beings , many countries are hard at work creating animal protection laws in the hope that in addition to wild animals , the pets with whom people have ever closer relationships , livestock and other animals that serve economic functions can also have legal protection . Humans will never stop eating and using animals , but some of the pain and hardship can be eliminated from how they use them . Such laws could also prevent unnecessary abuse .  
Today , the urban environment imposes restrictions on dogs , which need space to move . The chance of dogs living a vagrant existence increases greatly in big cities , where garbage piles up but is not easily cleared away , enhancing the chance for abandoned dogs ' survival . This is one of the reasons why impoverished nations have similar amounts of stray dogs as advanced nations .  
However , from the 17th century onwards , wave after wave of immigrants flooded onto this peaceful , happy land through the harbor at Tainan , encroaching on the Sirayas ' living space . Those Siraya who did not retreat further and further south or into the mountains accepted the rule of the incoming political authority and were subsequently assimilated .  
It was a terrible feeling , a sense that you had taken all the insults you could take , yet having to scratch out a living in the dirt . It was anguishing , pretending to be deaf and ignorant and compromising yourself due to the overall situation . " He adds , " There was no place to vent your sorrow . Sometimes you just had to hold in your tears and pretend to be cheering . "  
The hospital was on the ground floor , with the family 's living quarters above . On the landing , Peng 's mother would put pails of disinfectant and water , with which the children would have to wash themselves before being allowed upstairs . At a time of limited understanding of sanitary principles , when many Taiwanese children were malnourished , how Peng 's childhood differed from the vast majority of Taiwanese !  
But after many years of development , densely populated Hong Kong has a shortage of living space , and the developed area of the colony has steadily expanded . It has been impossible for Rennie 's Mill to avoid being drawn into these changes . And things get even more complicated when you consider what the coming of 1997 means , given the town 's political orientation .  
The furo bathroom , with which she is most satisfied , is separate from the main living area , and connects with the storeroom . It does not have an ordinary bathtub , but is dominated by a big traditional wooden tub , which keeps the water warm longer . There is also space for the big kitchen stove and the wood it burns .  
But later his father suffered a stroke , and the family faced a difficult financial situation . The burden of supporting the household fell entirely on Chou Meng-te 's shoulders , and he had no choice but to leave his undemanding teaching job with its regular salary and find another way to earn a living .  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election . ( His guess exceeded the theoretical limit of 260,000 because he also considered the number of ROC citizens in the US who still have legal residence in Taiwan , and thus are not included in the estimate of 260,000 eligible " overseas Chinese . "  
In recent years , wild animals raised in captivity have been given more living space and more natural surroundings . Still , says Marcus Phipps of TRAFFIC , there are still some extremist animal rights groups overseas who wish to close all zoos and sea-world theme parks , with the goal of returning the animals to their natural habitats .  
In fact the requirements are very broad : people over the age of 65 living on their own - - no matter whether they are weak , lonely , poor or just plain bored - - are all qualified .  
Based on his previous research work and on the finds at the ongoing test dig , Liu Yi-chang can offer a general description of the first Puli-ites - - " Tamalin Man " - - living 2400-1700 years ago . They were a late neolithic people who used flaked stone tools . From the large number of hitching stones and animal jawbones it can be inferred that they knew fishing and agriculture .  
Because chelonians are n't picky about their living conditions , with the exception of a few species such as the Indian star tortoise which has strict temperature requirements and often dies a year or two after being brought into captivity , most species of turtles resemble mutant ninja turtles and adapt quite well to sewers , which are designed to carry away urban pollutants . Turtles are tough .  
Furthermore , in the past Chinese would rarely consider questions from an anthropological perspective . Over the 5000 years of Chinese culture , what was regarded above all else , what was viewed as most magnificent , bold and righteous , was in fact far removed from a normal person 's way of living and values . After the May Fourth Movement , people reflected a lot on these problems .  
The country grew rich , and in 1938 the Labour government introduced the world 's most comprehensive social welfare system . New Zealanders , born with a silver spoon in their mouths , not only had their education , living expenses and health care paid for completely by the state , even their mothers looking after them could collect money from the government .  
Americans are condemned as ignoramuses living in a country that somehow manages to be both immature and degenerate . Japan is dismissed as a naive child with a fat body and a small brain under American occupation . The British are unfortunately represented by a debauched Oxford graduate whose main occupation seems to be standing up women in Thailand and mainland China .  
But it was not only deep in the mountains that one could see the spirit of thatched-cottage living among ancient literati . Even in the busy urban centers , some high officials , tired of extravagance and luxury , embellished their personal gardens with rustic thatched structures .  
When rain falls from the heavens groundwater is naturally replenished , and for thousands of years Chinese farmers have sung : " We work from sunrise / We rest at sunset / We dig wells for water / What do we care about the might of emperors ? " The ceaseless supply of groundwater bubbling up from wells enabled people to drink when they were thirsty and wash when they were dusty , and allowed agricultural society to ignore the power of emperors and self-confidently affirm that people 's value came from living on the land .  
It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture . " It has more meaning from the perspective of cultural preservation and education . "  
" At that time , we were only students , but living deep in the mountains , life was so hard for the Ssumakussu people . They brought out the best of all they had for us , and looking at their honest and simple faces , while we were very moved , we also felt ashamed and uneasy , " says Ma . " Who were they ?  
At museums , on the street , at sidewalk stands , in temples , at the vanguard of urban design , and in the shifting light and shadows of the city , looking for the value of existence , I 'm oppressed by a nightmare that piles up over my head as thick as clouds , blocking the road ahead . Masses of people coming , masses of people going , and I 'm just living on here in this empty , preposterous world of corruption and waste .  
Since appearing in Taiwan last Novem-ber , the book A Great Revolution in the Brain World has hit the spot with modern people living with " diseases of civilization . " It uses a mix of accessible language and medical evidence to propose an approach to health and longevity . This book became especially hot after NHK did a TV documentary series based on it . Bookstores sold out their copies in a week .  
In the end , Lin has selected and weighed the most absolutely central , canonical materials from history , taking into consideration every kind of musical genre and aspect of living concern , as in the typical emotions in human social life , praise of nature , the careful observation of transformations in space and time , various interesting features of everyday living , the fundamental pulse of life , and so forth , and in this way has gradually expanded the collection to 67 musical pieces .  
I believe that the problems that a family living in our crowded urban society must face in regards to the quality of living environment , educating children and economic pressures have already made us weary and incapable of patience when we must face situations within our families or in the outside world . What is more , jagged wounds have been left behind in our spirits and our bodies .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
He has created his own " iron net " tsun technique ( a painting technique utilizing cracking to represent irregular surfaces ) , which remains true to ink painting 's basic principles of contrast between black and white ; however , the sheer strength of his contrasts , the starkness of his strokes and their motley cracking , all suggest the alienation and disorder of post-modern living .  
Architecture scholar Wang Chen-hwa says that there are three kinds of historic building restoration : The first is untouched preservation , leaving a building how it is without touching a thing . Secondly , when a building has urban historical significance , there is restored preservation . Thirdly , if the building is still connected to people 's lives and is usable , a preservation method that involves active utilization of the building can be adopted . " Historic buildings are living and changing all the time , " he says .  
For the Rukai , living at the foot of the mountains , land belonged to the tribal chief , who was responsible for looking after the old and weak . But hunting land rights were determined by general agreement . Hunters did not necessarily leave their hunting grounds to their own children , and any child with an instinct for hunting could go into the mountains to learn from an elder huntsman .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
Looking from another angle , after the Communist Party of China had won power , if they had governed well , developed China , fulfilled the calls to " overtake the US and Britain , " and improved the living conditions of the people , then even if Zhang had acted traitorously , even though his actions were morally flawed , the result of these actions would have been that China became rich and strong and he would still be a national hero to be revered through the ages . However , this has not been the reality .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
Every two years , Dr . Lai Chiu-nan , originator of the " total natural health " lifestyle , based on a " living foods " diet , comes to Taiwan to promote her method for maintaining a healthy body , mind and spirit . Her talks always draw thousands of people . In March of this year , she came to Taiwan again to hold a workshop , leading 600 people in physical and mental training in the mountains of Shuanghsi in Taipei County .  
He avers that married couples have been through a long process of falling in love , marriage , and living together , which provides a foundation of emotional attachment and understanding . When divorce becomes inevitable , the two people have already been through repeated internal struggles .  
Shunza , who was born in Beijing , grew up in the US and studied music in Switzerland , sings of the desire to return home after years of wandering , sentiments which have won her a following in the ranks of students living away from home . She has also touched upon lust , an area that female Taiwanese singers rarely do , with the lyrics " I just ca n't get enough of you . " She also sings that the world is so boring that even the toys protest .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
During the Sino-Japanese war of 1895 , the northern fleet was completely destroyed . By the time of the collective foreign invasion during the Boxer Rebellion , there was complete psychological collapse among the Chinese masses , and the Qing government finally realized the seriousness of the problem of having a population living in ignorance .  
Tsai Yuan-pei had been living in France when he received a telegram from the Ministry of Education , hoping to entice him to come back to take the reins at Beida : " The nation is returning to normal , and urgently in need of education . Now we are making your virtuous self master of the capital 's highest academic institution . "  
Everyone makes their own special contributions . By combining our resources , our lives and activities have become much more varied , " Wang says . To publish the newsletter , professional botanists living in the community provide information about plants , those who studied art provide the graphics , and those who work for magazines write and edit the copy . The result is an impressive newsletter that is a major resource for keeping people informed and for building a sense of cohesion within the community .  
Six children had been severely burned during an experiment in a " talent " class when , through carelessness , the alcohol ignited causing an explosion and fire . A Mr . and Mrs . Wang Tsung-yuan , who had returned to Taiwan after living abroad in Canada , realized that their badly burned nine-year-old son would need psychological care in addition to physical treatment . They immediately asked the hospital to arrange it for them and encouraged the parents of the other children to talk to psychologists as well .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
The most novel interpretation of the tales of love between immortals and regular human beings appears in a book published in Taiwan , in which the author argues that the denizens of heaven are sapped of their sex drive by perpetually fair weather , beautiful clothing , delectable food , and centuries of living at a metabolic rate of zero .  
" He has melded cultural affirmation and ethnic self-respect with literary practice to create a purely Chinese literary form , " says Ng Kim Chew . " This provides solace to his personal sensibilities , both literary and ethnic . " There are few who can compare to ECM writers living in Taiwan in terms of how hard they work , either . Li Yung-ping was once an assistant professor in the department of foreign languages and literatures at National Sun Yat-sen University .  
The reason dZi beads have been connected to living Buddhas in Taiwan is that many believers take them to Buddhist masters to be " invested with spiritual power . " When Namgyal must tell people that what they supposed was a valuable old dZi bead is just a well-crafted reproduction , even he cushions the blow by saying that they can always ask a master to invest it with spiritual power so that it will become just as effective as a true old dZi bead .  
Of course , " The road to the Land of the Dead is traveled by old and young alike , " so the elderly and seriously ill are n't the only ones who need to make a will . People in their primes , living hectic , busy lives and under great pressure at work , should also be prepared for death at any moment .  
But with something as marvelously complex as the human body , there are always eventualities that can not be predicted in a living will . For instance , when a patient falls into a deep coma as a result of a stroke , the brain stem that controls cardiopulmonary functions may become completely unresponsive ( resulting in brain death ) . In such circumstances , a patient could die in a few minutes or might survive for two weeks , but death is assured .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
" The fact that aboriginal cultures are ' living cultures ' allows the Sheng Ye Museum to adopt an unusual style of exhibition , " explains Hsu Kung-ming , associate research fellow at the National Museum of Natural Science . " Unlike many other museums which must rely on displays of historical artifacts , the Sheng Ye Museum pays equal attention to collecting reproductions of antique styles , modern works of aboriginal art , and exhibiting displays created by contemporary craftsmen .  
Mr . Tseng , who makes his living from manufacturing metal parts for pet products , lives with his wife in Hsinchu , where they are both deeply involved in local charity work . They founded the Tong Hsin Volunteer Service Association , whose efforts are focused on services for the elderly and on recycling . They are also both counselors in the Hsinchu Family Education Service Center . Their colleagues consider them a perfect couple .  
Their owners are not only required to provide them with sufficient food and drinking water and a safe living environment with adequate shelter , air and light , but must also prevent them suffering unnecessary disturbance , abuse or injury . Animals must not be subjected to fear or pain when being transported , and they may only be slaughtered by humane methods which cause the least possible suffering .  
" With this behavioral outlet , people do n't consider the more important question of improvement . " Yeh says that the stray dogs " set free " onto Taiwan 's streets are symptomatic of people 's ingrained reluctance to face up to the real suffering of living things .  
The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times . The area has been a major center of civilization in China , and was the birthplace of renowned patriot-poet Qu Yuan and the statesman Zhuge Liang , among many others . Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
This 2,000-year-old sleeping beauty has " preserved her good looks " by being sealed in a plaster cast over 100 centimeters thick and using over 5,000 kilos of charcoal to dehumidify her tomb . When she was unearthed , archeologists found her wrapped in 18 layers of silk . Her hair was still black , some of her skin still retained a hint of suppleness , and her joints could still bend . Unlike the mummies of Egypt , the marquise seemed almost like a living person after centuries in the tomb .  
" Chelungpu is a classic reverse fault . The east side of the fault was thrust diagonally upwards , and more or less everyone living along that side was killed or injured . But although the west side was subjected to the same violent shaking , most of the buildings remained standing . "  
When Tiway Sayion retired from his position as principal of Hualien 's Tafalong Primary School after a teaching career that spanned 45 years , his first act was to realize a long-cherished dream-he returned to the tribal community where he was born and built a cabin in which to live . Tiway Sayion 's simple 20-ping cabin is laid out with the kitchen and bathroom on the right and the bedroom on the left . The center is his living room , furnished with only a sofa and bookshelves .  
While most miniatures show a predilection for ornate splendor , Hilbert focuses on the gritty reality of society 's lower rungs . In Low Lodging House , for example , he shows the shabby living conditions and lack of privacy suffered by the homeless people living in a British dosshouse . Torn and tattered clothing hangs from an indoor clothesline , while an unkempt child sits on a table . Similar themes are explored in such works as No Room Without Paying and Opium Smoker .  
At the door between the living room and dining room , there 's a tall ceramic cylinder suitable for storing scrolls , with a design that features the bright red canna blossom-a common sight in the countryside-around which bees are buzzing . Above are the words : " Busy Bees at Work . " The hardworking artist himself , who spends all day at his labors , is perhaps not unlike those bees .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
To avoid people being denied the right to medical self-determination because they are unable to express their will , anyone over 20 years of age and of full capacity may make an " advance declaration " of their wishes ( also known as a " living will " ) , and may appoint a medical representative who is empowered to sign a consent form on their behalf if they are unable to express themselves .  
Chromosomes , which carry the genetic blueprint for living organisms , are formed of tightly coiled strands of DNA , in which four chemical bases-designated A , T , G and C-are paired together in different combinations along a double-helix-shaped molecular chain . Certain sequences of base-pairs along these DNA strands form genes , and the totality of base pairs makes up the " genome . "  
It seems they have n't realized yet that they may live to be 85 . They have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that can be expected over the next 25 years . " She has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success . Indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother .  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
After the job of damage appraisal was finished , the association established a " home repair task force . " A lot of families were living in basically safe structures that were nevertheless in need of repairs .

Before the 1980s , academic work on aborigines was largely confined to anthropology . Research focused on things like the clothing , social structure , and myths and legends of the various tribes .

For fifty years people in Taiwan have worked their fingers to the bone to improve living standards and have neglected the beautiful mountains and rivers lying at their feet .

Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control .

Through contact with the Han Chinese and the Amis people living there , the unique characteristics of Bunun mountain culture were gradually lost .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
Thrilling as stories of epic heroism may be , there is a subject even more worth pondering : How is it that the combative and courageous Bunun are so respectful and gentle in dealing with the other living things that share their mountain surroundings ?

Mrs . BEZLEPKINA ( Russian Federation ) said that during the period of reorientation resulting from Russia 's adoption of democratic values and ideals the country 's internal resources were strained and its people were struggling with a falling standard of living .

In this regard , it is concerned as to whether sufficient budgetary allocations are made and adequate social measures are being taken to protect children , in particular those living in poverty or belonging to vulnerable groups , from being the victims of this situation , in the light of the provisions of articles 3 and 4 of the Convention .  
The past decade demonstrated that by expanding opportunities for women , especially in ways that enhance their productivity and income-earning potential , women will be able to raise their standard of living , thereby contributing to improved family well-being and the reduction and eradication of poverty , as well as to better national economic performance .  
The loss of life , the destruction of property , the disruption of the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians living in the western Beqaa and South Lebanon now seriously aggravated by the interdiction imposed by the Israeli naval blockade on thousands of fishermen to carry on their only gainful activity , are all acts of blatant Israeli defiance of the precepts of international law and Security Council resolutions 425 ( 1978 ) , 426 ( 1978 ) and 509 ( 1982 ) .

Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights , and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean ,  
Adjustment programmes are designed to promote both macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform , and thereby to lay the foundations for high quality growth - a prerequisite for a sustainable and equitable improvement in living standards .  
The budgetary burden will increase in the short and medium terms in connection with the extension of economic and social infrastructures to the rural areas and the unserviced urban periphery and inner-city slums where the poor are living .  
The objective is to assist the large numbers of the homeless and those living in poor shelter and unhealthy neighbourhoods , whether in urban slums and squatter areas or in poor rural areas , to meet their housing needs .  
The reports identify five major causes of increasing urbanization , all of which are about the search for better living conditions : rural unemployment and underemployment ; poor rural social services ; lack of arable land ; natural disasters , particularly drought ; and civil unrest .  
The consensus 9 / adopted by the Conference views environmental degradation as having many causes , including irrational development patterns , inappropriate technologies and consumption patterns , mainly among industrialized countries and privileged minorities in developing countries , and worsening standards of living for vast sectors of the population .  
The facilitation of mutually beneficial joint economic projects to improve living conditions in central and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina has helped to lay a foundation of confidence and trust among a population that had previously witnessed some of the most intense fighting in the present conflict .

During its special session ( 6-17 February 1995 ) on energy for rural development , the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development noted that adequate energy inputs were required for increased standards of living and productivity of human labour and for income generation in rural areas in developing countries where , on the eve of the twenty-first century , 2.5-billion people still have little or no access to commercial energy supplies and electricity .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Research themes to be studied from the data are : main facts and trends in vital events and population structures ; social , economic and demographic characteristics of older persons who are institutionalized ( and comparisons with those who are not institutionalized ) ; the living arrangements of older persons ; older persons ' labour-force participation status ; and their economic conditions , mobility patterns and spatial distribution .  
Particularly in Kuwait , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates , relatively large national incomes generated by oil revenues , combined with rapid urbanization , high standards of living , improved health care and gradually declining fertility rates resulting in part from improved education of women , will produce drastic changes in the demographic structure , including the marked ageing trends which have been projected .

The main development objectives of UNDP 's third country programme for Tokelau ( 1992-1996 ) focused primarily on developing a national identity and assumption of a greater degree of self-government ; improvement of living standards on the atolls ; ensuring the equitable distribution of resources ; and encouraging the active participation of the people in the development policy process .  
In circumstances in which the Belgrade Government is widely recognized as the champion of double standards , and the situation of Albanians living on their own lands in Kosovo is increasingly grave and alarming as a result of the Serbs ' repressive and truly genocidal activities , the entire content of the Serbian memorandum is simply ridiculous . 
Although they said that the main focus of UNICEF should continue to be in rural areas , several delegations stressed the need for UNICEF to emphasize poor populations living in such environmentally vulnerable areas as slums and marginal urban pockets .  
In particular , better understanding is beginning to emerge of linkages between the supply process on the one hand ( population , education , health ) , and the diverse and dynamic activity of fluctuating demand for human resources ( in public and private sector employing establishments , as well as self-employment and a growing variety of less formal ways of making a living ) on the other .  
In paragraph 12 ( g ) , making economic growth and the interaction of market forces more conducive to social development requires " ensuring substantial public and private investment in human resource development and in capacity-building in health and education , as well as in empowerment and participation , especially for people living in poverty or suffering from social exclusion " .  
The Heads of State and Government were conscious of the fact that the prime objective of their efforts must be aimed at improving the standard of living of their people and , in particular , at effectively combating the critical state of poverty in which a large part of them exist , and that they must commit themselves to promote the sustainable development of the region , as a viable strategy aimed at improving these conditions .  
Conscious of the fact that the prime objective of our efforts must be aimed at improving the standard of living of our people and , in particular , at effectively combating the critical state of poverty in which a large part of them exist , we commit ourselves to promote the sustainable development of our region as a viable strategy aimed at improving these conditions ;  
These internally displaced persons have suffered the hardships typical of other refugees and internally displaced persons : they were forced to flee their homes and established community structures at very short notice , unaware of where they were going or how they would end up and having to endure temporary shelter and extremely poor living conditions .  
If differences among countries ' living standards are the focus of the comparison , then a purchasing-power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate is regarded as the most appropriate method , as it values the commodities and services sold in each country at a set of common international prices , rather than at local prices multiplied by the value of the national currency determined in the foreign exchange market .  
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ;  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .  
According to the calculations made by advocates of this policy , it would cause such a serious deterioration in the standards of living of the population that spontaneous public demonstrations of popular discontent would occur , bringing to an end the social revolutionary process begun 36 years ago , and thereby fulfilling the main objective of the foreign policy towards Cuba of the last nine United States administrations .  
NULLConstituting more than half of the population living in absolute poverty , women would thus represent the majority of the beneficiaries targeted by any properly designed micro-entrepreneur and SME development programmes - except where their participation in production and economic activity is constrained by social factors or by special limitations on their access to capital .  
National Governments of all countries are encouraged to undertake a systematic assessment of the extent to which current international , regional and national warning systems adequately address their own requirements to provide ready access to warnings for all citizens , and particularly those living in local communities most exposed to hazards .  
The Special Rapporteur has not received any communication from the Government regarding the questions raised in his previous reports and at the same time the Government did not put forward any explanation or substantial denial in relation to the most serious abuses and violations , namely those committed against children living or working in the street and the camps set up for children belonging to these categories .  
The Special Rapporteur believes that the racial dimension of the violations and abuses against children living in northern Sudan , or , in the case of children in southern Sudan , those who are abducted and sold into slavery constitutes a particularly grave and alarming circumstance , which should be of particular concern from a human rights perspective .  
NULLAs far as the situation in southern Sudan is concerned , hundreds of thousands of children continue to live in insecurity in the conflict zones , in danger of being abducted , exposed to lasting psychological trauma , or living in inappropriate conditions .  
Problems are , among others , the lack of safe and sanitary living environments , malnutrition , the risk of infectious , parasitic and water-borne diseases , the growing consumption of tobacco , alcohol and drugs , unwarranted risk-taking and destructive activity , resulting in unintentional injuries .  
Technical and financial cooperation is still needed from the international community , however , failing which there is little likelihood of consolidation of economic growth , reconstruction , improved living conditions for the poorest sectors of the population , peace , democracy and the functioning of democratic institutions .  
Another institution with a direct bearing on the process of reconstruction and improving the living conditions of poor groups is the Social Investment Fund , which channels assistance to poor sectors of the population , including those uprooted by the conflict , thereby meeting the dual objective of combating poverty and strengthening the process of national reconstruction and reconciliation .  
Despite all the efforts of the international community , particularly the Paris Club and development partners such as France , Germany , Japan , the United States of America , Denmark and Canada , to alleviate the debt burden and cancel part of the bilateral official debt , the least developed countries continued to experience a falling standard of living .  
They were confident that their standard of living was improving , that their poor would soon be employed , that their children would become better educated , and that they would be taken seriously as economic actors on the world stage .  
In addition , the phenomenon of the caste system , which could be characterized as multiple apartheid , also must be addressed openly with a view to mitigating the suffering of millions of people living a life of bondage and discrimination which divided them into upper and lower echelons , segregated them and excluded them from the political , economic , social and cultural spheres of society . 
While the term " living resources " in the Convention might be broad enough to include free living and symbiotic micro-organisms , the collection and subsequent use of microbial genetic resources is not necessarily analogous to traditional methods of harvesting marine living resources .  
In the situation when the levels of earnings and the standard of living are very low , when even the basic needs for food , accommodation and clothing are difficult to meet , it is more and more difficult for the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to devote attention to environmental quality and protection .  
Problems are , among others , the lack of safe and sanitary living environments , malnutrition , the risk of infectious , parasitic and water-borne diseases , the growing consumption of tobacco , alcohol and drugs , unwarranted risk-taking and destructive activity , resulting in unintentional injuries .  
The economic crisis faced by LDCs has further undermined health conditions in many countries as living standards have fallen , health services have been cut owing to budgetary pressures , and the availability of imported medicines and other medical supplies has dwindled .  
Regarding preparations at the national level , the Committee took note of the substantial progress achieved since the first substantive session , and further strengthened the best practices initiative on improving the living environment by further refining the criteria for nomination and the format for reporting on best practices .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 and 49 / 9 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
It was pleased to note that , with the assistance and support of the international community and through the committed efforts of the Palestinian population , the Palestinian Authority had gradually established its administration and had taken a number of measures to ensure public order and to normalize Palestinian political , social , economic and cultural life , as well as to improve living conditions .  
The gradual economic reform which the transition to a market economy required was having adverse repercussions on the population 's standard of living and particularly on the most vulnerable sectors such as the disabled , elderly persons and young people .  
The living quarters allowance is intended to reimburse United States government civilian employees for costs for a temporary residence or housing whenever Government-owned or rented housing is not provided ( including rent , heat , light , fuel , gas , electricity , water and taxes , insurance and agent 's fees required by law or custom to be paid by the lessee ) .  
In the case of the United States government employee assigned or posted to a foreign area , the base pay is augmented by living quarters allowance , post allowance , post differential , danger pay , and other allowances , as applicable .  
The report on international cooperation for the eradication of poverty in developing countries ( A / 50 / 396 ) was valuable overall and responded generally to resolution 48 / 184 of 21 December 1993 ; however it lacked details on specific actions undertaken by United Nations bodies with respect to the role and needs of women living in poverty or the actions taken to improve social services in deprived urban areas .  
recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
With regard to the programme of activities for the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , ILO had adopted the only international legal instrument addressing the question of the living and working conditions of indigenous and tribal peoples , the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989 , which recognized that such peoples had a unique cultural identity , and stressed the need to involve them in the making of decisions that would affect their future .

The eradication of poverty requires that a sustained , collective commitment and effort be mounted by Governments , local administrations , civil society , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and also requires that anti-poverty strategies and programmes be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
macroeconomic factors which lay beyond the control of the countries of the southern hemisphere , where the vast majority of refugee populations were to be found , had impoverished those countries even further , leading to massive outflows of people seeking better living conditions .  
The purpose of the process is to create an administration that can carry forward the implementation of democratic social and economic reforms ; an administration capable of utilizing all past experiences and of consistently and dynamically creating conditions for the well-balanced development of the country ; and , finally , an administration that will ensure that the burden of reforms is evenly distributed , that will care about improving the living standards of Polish families , and that will work to ensure that citizens can live in peace , free from the fear of crime and economic abuse .  
In the context of globalization and integration in which our countries are evolving , Governments are bound to assume a much more active role in helping to create efficient and competitive environments in our economies , thus enabling us to improve the standards of living of our peoples and contributing to the resolute head-on fight against corruption and impunity at the national and international levels . 
The International Tribunal set up to identify agents of genocide living abroad has not been effective , as it has been crippled by organizational , financial and operational obstacles .  
They also include improving public health , with emphasis on prevention and service for the most vulnerable groups especially children including planning , organizing and financing local health services ; improving basic public education , with emphasis on reducing illiteracy and on vocational training , with community participation , improved educational infrastructure , the promotion of culture and so on ; and the improvement of living conditions , physical planning and local infrastructure  
We should also remember that durable peace and sustainable development on a global scale can not be achieved unless all countries secure adequate living standards for their populations and overcome unemployment , poverty , social disintegration and environmental pollution .  
In the past four years the economy recorded an average growth rate of 8.2 per cent , resulting in increased employment opportunities and significantly rising living standards in the country , primarily in urban areas , where private enterprises are flourishing , and in fertile rural areas , where farmers have better incentive to grow and market their produce .  
To complete its programme of building a State based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all citizens of Benin would enjoy a certain minimum standard of living , the Government of Benin wishes to benefit further from the support and assistance of the entire international community .  
This has been done to achieve balance and stability in the economy as a whole and to activate the role of the private sector on the basis of a market economy and free competition , while taking into account the importance of improving basic essential social services , building a modern State and improving the standard of living of citizens .  
The Government , in partnership with other sectors of society , is playing a multiple role in improving living and working conditions on an equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoy adequate shelter , affordable basic services and sustainable human settlements .  
We are living in a world in which events are occurring that would have been unimaginable just a short while ago , major political changes in international relations that prompt us to rethink international law .  
Globalization is a positive force for the future of the entire world : unprecedented development in investment and trade , the opening up of the most populous regions of the world to international trade ; and the possibility for more developing countries to improve their populations ' living standards .  
Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
Likewise , we are deeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of Africa and other developing countries , as well as by the heavy burden involved in debt servicing , which is one of the causes of the continuous economic and social deterioration of our standard of living .  
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
Furthermore , and still within the same context of prevention , the countries whose institutions and infrastructures have been devastated by long-standing domestic warfare now need increased assistance from the international community to help them rebuild their economies and improve the living conditions of their peoples , because without ongoing economic and social development , internal tensions will always continue to threaten the stability of these countries .  
I should also like to reiterate the proposal made by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , President of the Republic of Tunisia , advocating the concept of a global economic and social plan aimed at guaranteeing African growth on sound and lasting bases and at assisting our continent to remedy its deficiencies , achieve integration into the world economy and ensure dignified living conditions for all peoples in Africa .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
Given the progress made to date , we can not forget that we must move towards prohibiting and completely eliminating this kind of weapon , because of its mass , indiscriminate and devastating effects , its long-term threat , its tragic human consequences and its widespread hindrance of the productive use of broad areas , particularly affecting those most in need and seriously jeopardizing the living conditions of many peoples .  
Peace is built through ordinary coexistence , with all Guatemalans , male or female , striving daily to make a living and to help their families get ahead , seeking out better opportunities while enduring hardships in a country with so many limitations and so much distrust . 
We view with appreciation and hope the fact that this interaction between Guatemala 's experience and the respectful participation of Governments and multilateral institutions is yielding modest but valid solutions , enabling us to envisage a simple , competent and less bureaucratic form of institutional structures , and a kind of cooperation that does not undermine the precarious living conditions of the poor majorities in our countries and that contributes ideas and technical skills with due respect for our population .  
Stresses that Governments , in partnership with civil society and all other development actors , including non-governmental organizations and people living in poverty and their organizations should cooperate to meet the basic human needs of all - inter alia , income , resources , education , health care , nutrition , shelter , sanitation and safe water - in particular of people living in poverty and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups ;  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
Although the Security Council meets far away from the scene of the events we are discussing today , and although we are not subject to the difficulties faced by the people in the field , I believe it is important that the personnel of the United Nations civilian and military should be aware of our solidarity with them and understanding of the difficult tasks and living conditions that they have to face .  
As industrialization proceeds in the dynamic developing economies and middle-income developing countries , rising standards of living and rapid urbanization will contribute to strong growth in electricity demand and petroleum consumption will rise from an increase in private motor transport .  
The host countries may request the Secretariat of the United Nations , within existing resources , to disseminate information which would be helpful to the diplomatic community in resolving the debt problems , including , inter alia , provisions of relevant international legal instruments and United Nations documents as well as information provided by the host countries on cost of living at a location concerned and relevant provisions of national legislation ;  
Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
Also recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
With regard to Tibet , her delegation noted that it had formed an integral part of China since the thirteenth century and that the Tibetan people had assumed control of their country in 1959 , the year in which China had abolished serfdom and introduced democratic reforms in Tibet . In the past 30 years , the country 's economy had developed and the standard of living had risen .  
That gesture had a double symbolism , as it expressed the traditional friendship between the Cyprus and Palestinian peoples and constituted a concrete manifestation of the progress in the peace process and of the need for substantial steps to improve the standard of living of the Palestinian people .  
Recalling that the Committee had requested a summary of the report presented by Ukraine at the Fourth World Conference on Women and had asked for further details of the commitments which Ukraine had made in Beijing , she said that the Ukrainian report to the Conference had described the overall deterioration of the situation of women , the decline in the standard of living , and the worsening demographic situation resulting from economic problems and the impact of the Chernobyl disaster , which continued to consume significant budgetary resources .  
The basic reasons for the rising divorce rate were the overall situation of political and economic instability , low incomes , difficult living conditions and environmental problems , and inadequate nutrition for children .  
Hiding behind a " living shield " of members of the Government forces , they are continuing attacks which are compelling the command of the armed forces of the Republic of Tajikistan to abandon the positions occupied by it in order to avoid unjustified losses of life among military personnel and the civilian population .  
Provision of adequate social services and facilities , improving and rationalizing urban planning and shelter design to cope firmly with the actual needs of communities , as well as provision of technical and other relevant assistance to the inhabitants of unplanned settlements are essential for the improvement of living conditions .  
In many cases , the unrestricted use of technology , the growing demand for goods and services from the ocean , uncontrolled population growth and continuous migration to coastal areas have led to the depletion of living resources and the degradation of the coastal and marine environment as well as of the economic conditions of some of the major sectors exploiting the ocean .  
A number of other actions can be noted , such as the 1993-1994 ban on the dumping of radioactive waste , sewage sludge and industrial waste and on incineration of toxic wastes at sea , as agreed in the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter ( London Convention ) ; ( c ) In relation to programme areas C and D , the legal framework for sustainable use and conservation of living aquatic resources in the oceans has been substantially improved since UNCED .  
Protection of the atmosphere , in regard to : ( i ) absorption of greenhouse gases ; ( ii ) climate change and its potentially drastic effects on marine living resources ; ( iii ) energy optimization programmes and reduction of dangerous substances in exhaust gas emissions ; and ( iv ) reduction in the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) in at-sea and coastal ocean industries ; ( g ) Chapter 10 .  
We recognize that access to safe and healthy shelter and basic services is essential to a person 's physical , psychological , social and economic well-being and should be a fundamental part of our urgent actions for the more than 1-billion people without decent living conditions .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
The living and working conditions in all human settlements , including regional urban centres , rural service centres , rural hamlets , rural communities , market towns and villages , must be improved , with particular emphasis on shelter , social and physical infrastructure , and services .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
Provide equal access to basic education , while paying special attention to the poor and to youth living in rural areas , and addressing constraints created by distance , lack of educational facilities and social or economic barriers ;  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
The economic crisis faced by LDCs has further undermined health conditions in many countries as living standards have fallen , health services have been cut owing to budgetary pressures , and the availability of imported medicines and other medical supplies has dwindled .  
It will be difficult for those who must daily face a lack of the basic necessities of life to commit themselves to a democratic system unless it brings about a genuine improvement in their low standard of living .  
In view of the harsh economic situation , the United Nations Special Coordinator in the occupied territories stated that the standard of living of Palestinians living under the autonomous region of Gaza had declined by 50 per cent since the signing of the Interim Agreement . 8 / A special appeal was launched to the donor community to support the Palestinian authorities in this crucial period . 
Bearing in mind that the increasing number of women living in poverty in developing countries , especially in the rural areas and urban slums , requires the urgent action of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures at the national and regional levels towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , [ 2 ] / adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women ,  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
( e bis ) Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ; ( g ) Reduce excessive military expenditures and investments for arms production and acquisition , as is appropriate and consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development ;  
The emphasis on artisanal mining is consistent with the objectives of the main international development funding organizations , such as the World Bank objective , stated at the round table , to alleviate poverty and improve living standards through sustainable growth and investment in people , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) objectives of poverty alleviation , environmental protection , job creation and promotion of the advancement of women .  
An action programme can then be prepared , based on the survey results , with a view to : ( a ) establishing enabling conditions for artisanal mining , ( b ) alleviating technical and financial constraints , and ( c ) improving the environmental , living and working conditions of miners .  
Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .  
It should be possible to quadruple the goods and services that could be produced with a given quantity of natural resources and energy , which would enable developing countries to quadruple their production and consumption without increasing their environmental impact , while the developed countries could maintain their standard of living while greatly reducing their environmental impact .  
The Working Group also stressed the need for increased support for training and capacity-building in the field of integrated management of coastal areas , and stressed the need for taking action to protect all critical habitats of marine living resources in the coastal zone , including coral reefs , mangroves , mudflats and estuaries .  
At the same time , we wish to stress our belief that a complete and absolute solution to the problem of extremism and terrorism is linked to bringing an end to the unfair and unjust practices against our people , to the achievement of further political progress in the peace process and to improvements in the living conditions and the difficult economic situation of our people .  
Document good practices , innovative models and success stories with respect to assisting women in improving their living and working environment , to the adoption of sound environmental technologies and to women 's role in maintaining sustainable urban environments under conditions of globalization and rapid urbanization , and propose ways of assisting them in that role ( UNIFEM , UNEP / UNCHS , World Bank , UNDP , UNESCO , DPCSD ) .  
" Micro-organisms " : bacteria , viruses , mycoplasmas , rickettsiae or fungi , whether natural , enhanced or modified , either in the form of " isolated live cultures " , including in dormant form or in dried preparations , or as material , including living material , which has been deliberately inoculated or contaminated with such cultures .  
The policies announced by the Government included a halt to the printing of money , a reduction in the excessive amounts of money in circulation , increases in the charges on government-provided goods and services , the sale of some government assets , and a relaxation of the restrictions on foreign exchange trading by allowing official exchange houses to trade at rates comparable with those available on the parallel market , as well as by allowing Iraqis living abroad to transfer funds to their relatives in Iraq .  
The number of individuals living in water-stressed countries or countries with a chronic water scarcity will increase tenfold in only one generation to encompass more than one third of the world population .  In waste areas , there has been an overexploitation of aquifers , which are becoming ever more seriously depleted .  The risks that threaten to erupt wherever socio-economic development depends on a continuously undermined key resource are evident : ultimate resource constraints will one day send shocks through such vulnerable societies .  
The Committee concluded that global demand was likely to increase for the foreseeable future , mainly as a result of the continuing increase in global population through most of the next century , and of the demand for improved living standards in developing countries .  
Promoting cooperation among government agencies , health-care workers , non-governmental organizations , women 's organizations and other institutions of civil society in order to develop a comprehensive national strategy for improving reproductive health care and child health-care services and ensuring that people living in poverty have full access to those services , including , inter alia , education and services on family planning , safe motherhood and prenatal and postnatal care , and the benefits of breast-feeding , consistent with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development ;  
We are referring to the desire of the peoples and States of the Commonwealth to make more effective use of their material and intellectual potential with a view to stimulating their economies , raising their standard of living and ensuring sustainable democratic development .  
Our deliberations on the two major themes of the Conference - adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world - have been inspired by the Charter of the United Nations and are aimed at reaffirming existing and forging new partnerships for action at the international , national and local levels to improve our living environment .  
To this end , we commit ourselves to improving the living conditions in human settlements in ways that are consonant with local needs and realities , and we acknowledge the need to address the global , economic , social and environmental trends to ensure the creation of better living environments for all people . 
As stated in the aide-m \ x { 5e66 } oire transmitted to the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Buenos Aires on 27 February 1996 , the Argentine Republic reiterates that the only rules applicable to the utilization of Antarctic marine living resources in the area adjacent to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are those laid down in the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and such rules adopted by the Commission established under the Convention as are currently in force .  
Noticing that the 14-million eligible voters among the 21.3-million Republic of China citizens living in Taiwan , Penghu ( Pescadores ) , Kinmen ( Quemoy ) and Matsu area have , through universal , equal and direct suffrage and secret balloting , elected their first popularly elected president on 23 March 1996 as their genuine representative in the international community ,  
Benefits are payable for 28 weeks to the mother ; in the case of women having given birth to two or more children and caring for at least two , as well as of women not married , widowed , divorced or solitary for other serious reasons and not living in common-law marriage , the payment of benefits is extended to 37 weeks .  
Although the total investment reached $ 95 billion in 1990 , it still fell short of the 25 per cent rate , which is normally the minimum level assumed to ensure Africa 's economic growth and a steady growth of the standard of living per capita .  
This degree of importance becomes even more obvious as one realizes that water is a natural resource which is scarce and limited and whose quality has repercussions in the ecosystems of which it is the core , thus capable of harming the living conditions of both present and future generations .  
The problem is that normally people living in areas with high potential biodiversity values are poorer and have less or no paying capacity compared with people in industrialized countries , where the value of biodiversity is often recognized , for example , as raw material for the pharmaceutical industry , or in terms of recreation for visitors . 
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
The programme is designed to improve urban living conditions and strengthen municipal institutional capacities for the planning and operation of urban facilities and public services , including water supply and solid waste management .  
On 1 August 1996 , notwithstanding the repeated complaints by the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations and the many requests made to the authorities of the host country by citizens living in the vicinity of the Mission and by organizations representing various groups within American society to remove these provocative and offensive signs , the sign located on the north-east corner , inside the security area of the Permanent Mission of Cuba , was not taken down but simply moved to the north-west corner of the same intersection .  
Some 15,750 persons living in the Jamahiriya are suffering from serious medical conditions ( cardiovascular disease ; fractures of the spinal column and thorax ; fractured skulls ; chronic eye diseases ; detached retinas ; serious burns ; cancer and malignant tumours ) which require emergency treatment ( neurosurgery ; spinal marrow transplants ; kidney transplants ; corneal transplants ; fitting of prostheses ) .  
The only viable long-term solution to the twin issues of unemployment and poverty lies in the building up of competitive productive capacities that can generate production and incomes among the population at large , a process in which industry is not the sole contributor .  However , all historical evidence suggest that industry plays a pivotal role in advancing technology , increasing productivity , nurturing entrepreneurship and generating a broad range of critical skills , all of which converge to increase a country 's standard of living .  
In their aspirations to raise standards of living , the developing countries are following the example of the already industrialized countries , and by seeking to build up efficient industrial capacities have chosen the only viable route to achieve lasting economic growth and escape the vicious circle of poverty .  
It is patently clear - and accepted throughout the developing world - that functioning markets and private initiative are among the most efficient and powerful mechanisms to generate wealth and thus permit increased standards of living .  
We reiterate that a comprehensive strategy in the fight against drugs must include the social and economic aspects of the phenomenon , to which end efforts must be directed towards alternative social and regional development programmes designed to help improve the living conditions of the rural families affected .  
In its resolution 47 / 180 of 22 December 1992 , the General Assembly , concerned that people 's living environments were deteriorating and in urgent need of concerted international attention , decided to convene the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in 1996 and to establish a preparatory committee for the Conference , and requested the Secretary-General to establish an ad hoc secretariat for the Conference .  
The Committee wishes to remind the international community that these tragic developments follow repeated warnings about the devastating consequences for Palestinian hopes and living conditions , of the delayed implementation by Israel of the agreements already reached , its prolonged closure of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the resumption of land confiscation and settlement , and actions against Palestinian property and institutions in Jerusalem .  
To secure a reasonable standard of living for the farming community especially through raising personal income for people employed in agriculture ;  
Contributing to this improvement were the slight deceleration of inflation ( as of July 1996 , 17.6 per cent on an annual basis ) ; increase in available foreign exchange owing to a growing number of visitors , both Haitians living abroad and foreigners ; and strengthening of the gourde resulting from the inflow of foreign currency by bilateral or multilateral donors to finance public investments .  
In my view , the presence and assistance of the international community will continue to be required beyond November 1996 to help the Government of Haiti set up a professional , well - managed and well-equipped civilian police and ensure that a stable environment will be consolidated , that democracy will take root and that economic and social development will translate into a visible improvement of the living conditions of the people . 
Viet Nam stands ready to cooperate with all countries for the effective implementation of the Treaty , contributing to a cleaner global environment and living conditions , enhancement of confidence and strengthening of international security , aimed at a more secure and healthy world .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
One of the most important reforms has been the creation of the National Solidarity Fund , into which voluntary contributions by citizens and enterprises are channelled , and the purpose of which is to implement programmes to provide remote regions and areas with a standard of living allowing the inhabitants access to basic communal facilities such as decent housing , health and educational infrastructures , roads , electricity and drinking water .  
The programme is intended for poor people living in rural , urban and peri-urban areas and has the advantage of combining various components designed to mitigate the chief manifestations of poverty : underemployment and unemployment , lack of skills , and precarious living and environmental conditions . 
Following the visits of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to a number of the country 's rural and urban areas , during which he noted the inhabitants ' difficult living conditions , the Select Ministerial Council decided to establish a national programme to remedy the situation in districts lacking basic infrastructures . 
It must be pointed out here that children and adolescents are targeted by this education-for-health programme as recipients and agents who can pass on the benefits , and health topics are increasingly incorporated in primary and secondary curricula as well as in cultural activities in schools and universities ( hygiene , nutrition , accident prevention , living with domestic animals , prevention of transmissible diseases , contraception , sexually transmitted diseases , AIDS . . . ) . 
They reaffirmed that the Convention and the agreements represented significant achievements of the international community through multilateral efforts in creating a legal order for the seas and the oceans that will , inter alia , facilitate international communications , promote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans , the equitable and efficient utilization of their resources , the conservation of their living resources and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
In addition , a special State programme had been drawn up to address the cultural , spiritual , educational and socio-economic problems of the 12-million ethnic Ukrainians living abroad .  
That being said , it was obvious that there were still dramatic variations between regions , and the question was whether the current relatively robust growth in the developing countries as a whole would translate itself into a widespread improvement of living conditions and especially into poverty reduction worldwide . 
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill-treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as the girl child , children of single-parent families and those born out of wedlock , children in rural areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who , in order to survive , are living and / or working in the streets .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee recommends that special protective measures be implemented in relation to children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single-parent families , children born out of wedlock , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , children involved with the juvenile justice system , particularly when deprived of their liberty , children involved in child labour and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , children living in poverty and children who , in order to survive , are living and / or working in the streets .  
The topic touches not only on the protection and preservation of the marine environment , including that of the international seabed area , but also on such other matters as the application of the consent regime for marine scientific research , the regime for protected areas in the exclusive economic zone , the duties of conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas , and the sustainable development of living marine resources generally .  
SBSTTA has recommended that this expert group should concentrate on determining the following areas where the Biodiversity Convention can have the greatest effect : integrated marine and coastal area management , marine and coastal protected areas , sustainable use of coastal and marine living resources , mariculture and alien species . 193 Other items of particular note discussed by SBSTTA included the economic valuation of biological diversity and its components , in particular in relation to access to genetic resources ( art . 15 of the Convention ) .  
Besides being of great scientific importance for studies of active geological processes in deep ocean basins , including plate tectonics , as well as climate studies , the map has proved of commercial value : already , fishermen use it to locate seamounts that produce upwellings of deep , nutrient-rich water that in turn supports abundant living resources ; industries use it to find the kinds of rocks that overlay oilfields and the kinds of volcanic eruptions that form undersea deposits of copper , iron , silver and gold .  
In Kazakstan , for example , emigration was sparked by social and economic reasons stemming from the decline in production during the period of transition , inadequate social reforms , and the decline in the standard of living , as well as by ethnic and cultural factors and environmental problems .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements worldwide , 2 .  Endorses the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements [ 3 ] / and the Habitat Agenda [ 4 ] / adopted by the Conference on 14 June 1996 ;  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
New , often very complex tasks in insecure living / working environments , especially for staff employed by humanitarian agencies , and mobility in both function and location are the main features of the current work of the international civil service .  
His Government reiterated its commitment to work with the United Nations in matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security in the hope that some day all the Organization 's human and financial resources could be devoted to encouraging social development and improving the living conditions of people everywhere .  
The Government and Brazilian society were resolved to work together to ensure full enjoyment of civil , economic , social and cultural rights , as well as political freedom , which was essential to improve the standard of living of the population .  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
The measures adopted to recognize and ensure the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the childs physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development ;  
The relevant indicators used to assess such an adequate standard of living , and its incidence among the child population , including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , social and ethnic origin , and family situation ;  
All the measures taken , in accordance with national conditions and within the State party 's means , to assist parents and others responsible for the child to implement this right , including the nature of the assistance made available , its budget implications , its relation to the cost of living and its impact on the population ; where relevant , the information provided should be disaggregated , inter alia by region , rural / urban area , age , gender and social and ethnic origin ;  
The right to development was thus essential to the peoples of developing countries , who needed higher incomes , improved social , health and education services and a chance to escape from extreme poverty and enjoy better living conditions if they were to be able to make a constructive contribution to the development of democratic systems that would guarantee full respect for their human rights .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General [ 1 ] on the implementation of resolution 50 / 10 ;  
Intensive humanitarian assistance was required from the international community to improve the living conditions and relieve their suffering until a just and comprehensive solution was reached in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) of 11 December 1948 .  Lebanon considered that the presence of Palestine refugees in its territory was temporary and was a consequence of Israeli occupation and the continuation of the Middle East crisis .  
I am sure it is obvious to all persons living in the south that the economic , social and political isolation imposed upon us has been counter-productive as this treatment has helped us to get stronger on our feet and to find adequate alternatives for self-existence , all of which help to consolidate and give permanence to the division of the island .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements , 
Recommends that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty and to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty and the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
In fact , the much needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , who continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .

The draft resolution before us on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing , unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction and fisheries by-catch and discards draws attention to a number of damaging practices that continue to threaten a sustainable future for the world 's living marine resources .  
They combine reckless exploitation of living resources in these zones with the dumping of hazardous material and other equally repugnant activities contrary to international law and civilized conduct .  
At the national level my country has pursued for some years a solid , viable , scientifically based programme to ensure the sustainability of tuna fishing and to guarantee the preservation of all living marine resources .  
The 1982 Convention , although the most universal and extensive instrument on the law of the sea , nevertheless can not fully reflect the growing concern of coastal States at the state of living marine resources , which often fall victim to uncontrolled and scientifically unsound harvesting on the high seas .  
Finally , a rising incidence of occasional or " weekend prostitution " by young housewives or students wanting to improve their standard of living by prostituting themselves on weekends or for a limited period of time , as a direct result of the economic crisis and unemployment , is becoming apparent .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting public-private partnerships , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
These are to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and the building of ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
Revisions were made to improve data quality in the following items : ( i ) data on " children ever born " and " children living " should be collected by sex ; ( ii ) " date of birth of the last child born alive " was introduced to replace " live births within the 12 months preceding the census " to measure current fertility ; and ( iii ) " deaths in the 12 months preceding the census " was added to measure current mortality .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
The Commission also considered the report of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 17 ) , submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 1996 / 12 , concerning the problems related to the right to enjoy an adequate standard of living ; foreign debt , economic adjustment policies and their effects on the full enjoyment of human rights and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
To transform the Gambia into a financial centre , a tourist paradise , a trading export-oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation , thriving on free market policies and a vibrant private sector , sustained by a well-educated , trained , skilled , healthy , self-reliant and enterprising population , and guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent standard of living for one and all , under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry .  
In fact , the much-needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people also remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , which still continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they had designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .  
And for peace to be truly meaningful it must also be translated into concrete improvements in the living conditions of the long-suffering Palestinian people ; hence , there is an urgent need for economic , financial and technical assistance by the international community .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
While it was true that fees for courts and lawyers were higher than the average Kenyan might be able to afford , this problem was economic in nature and could best be solved by development projects geared to raising the standards of living of the entire citizenry .  
Their employees are provided with public transport but not food and , generally speaking , their living conditions are harsh and inhumane , leading one migrant worker to say It 's exploitation ; the living conditions are unbearable , like in a prison .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Independent , speedy and effective legal and / or administrative procedures for seeking redress , containing such features as fast-tracking for cases where the complainant is terminally ill , investigatory powers to address systemic cases of discrimination in policies and procedures , ability to bring cases under pseudonym and representative complaints , including the possibility of public interest organizations bringing cases on behalf of people living with HIV / AIDS ;  
To that end , the Parties propose that , based on the electoral rolls , the Supreme Electoral Tribunal , in consultation with political parties , should identify the places in which voting centres are to be set up within municipalities ; such places would be those which have large numbers of residents living a long way from the municipal capital and which are also accessible to party poll-watchers and electoral observers .  
Many independent experts and NGOs have also identified the structural adjustment policy package as a major cause of the deepening of poverty and deterioration in social and living conditions in many developing countries in the past two decades .  
In addition to the poverty in which Venezuela 's population was living , the Committee was extremely concerned at the absence of any practical plans at the grass-roots level for putting forward women 's demands , and at the fact that it was difficult to secure passage of legislative proposals for meeting women 's needs .  
Those events had a direct impact on humanitarian conditions , owing to the resultant imposition of increased restrictions on the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern Cyprus , stricter security measures and interruption of regular medical transport to the southern part of the island as well as loss of employment for Turkish Cypriots working in the southern part of Cyprus .  
Taking measures - no matter how good they may be - will not suffice ; such measures must be backed by concrete actions demonstrating the political will to crush all discrimination and to improve the study conditions of students and the living conditions of teachers , especially in this transitional period of declining teaching quality and school attendance , as well as of failure to recognize the importance of the teacher 's function ( the level of remuneration is so low that many are abandoning that noble profession ) .

The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .

Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
Since countries differed in terms of their living conditions , level of development , geographic characteristics and cultural traditions , there could be no uniform standard or model for solving the problems related to human settlements .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .

The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
In its resolution 51 / 202 , the Assembly stressed the importance of encouraging national initiatives for social development , including , inter alia , credit for people living in poverty , particularly women , along the model of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in connection with self-employment and income generation to address the feminization of poverty , and noted with interest the micro credit summit to be held in Washington , D.C . , in February 1997 .

The closure had had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the occupied territories with at least 10 per cent of the population living below the poverty line and the losses resulting from the current closure estimated at more than US $ 6 million a day , which was more than the financial assistance provided by foreign donors .  
Despite the political and economic development achieved at the regional and international levels , the establishment of economic groupings and the expansion of free trade , there had been an increase in poverty , diseases and illiteracy resulting in a deterioration in the standards of living of developing countries .

Quality of life is determined not simply by material goods , but is made up of a whole set of simultaneously interwoven factors : health , education , employment , elimination of poverty , respect of human rights , the possibility of self-fulfilment , social and cultural integration and living in an ecologically enlightened environment .  
The objectives of this programme have focused on bettering the standard of living , diversifying the structure of the national economy and the sources of revenue , on social equity , a balanced development , and the development and evolution of human resources .

With regard to the right to an adequate standard of living , the Syrian Arab Republic has shown special concern for the agricultural sector in view of its important role in the economic development process , since it constitutes the principal source of every individual 's vital requirements such as food and clothing .  
This is illustrated by the " healthy villages " project , a community-based project designed , sponsored and monitored by the Ministry of Health and adopted by the village community , with assistance from other public bodies , with a view to improving all aspects of village living conditions , particularly in the health , environmental , social and economic fields .  
With regard to other endemic diseases , the efforts made to combat tuberculosis in Syria , as in other parts of the world , were highly successful in reducing the incidence of this disease which , however , subsequently reappeared for various reasons related to living conditions and the methods employed to combat the disease , particularly the unscientific remedial measures that led to an increase in the number of reported cases , some of which were resistant to treatment .

The peace process would , however , be stalled so long as Israel continued to violate the rules of international law and international humanitarian law as well as the relevant resolutions of the United Nations .

In accordance with article 19 of the Convention , there was an urgent need to consider modalities for advance informed agreement outlining appropriate procedures in the field of safe transfer , handling and use of any a living modified organism resulting from biotechnology that might have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
Governments had expressed their determination to advance the negotiations , but the political will had been insufficient to put aside the purely economic and commercial interests and give priority to the potential risks that living modified organisms represented for health and for the conservation of the planets biological diversity .  
Expressing its grave concern for the well-being of internally displaced persons , particularly in Kabul and in the Panjsher , Bamian and Kunduz regions , and for the civilian population of Afghanistan living without shelter , who face a long winter possibly deprived of basic foods as a result of the recent fighting , as well as the denial by the warring factions of adequate conditions for the delivery of aid by humanitarian organizations ,  
In contrast , it held that discretionary payments for ongoing ordinary living expenses that are incurred after a person has left the region and taken up a new residence should not normally be considered to be direct consequences of the invasion and occupation of Kuwait .  
So the systemic contest was founded on a similar set of proclaimed values or objectives : rationality , efficiency and equity on a general level , and modernization , growth and an improved living standard for the majority on a more concrete level .  
However , it needed a human face , a people-centred approach based on improving the standard of living for all : poverty must be eradicated , peoples basic needs must be fulfilled and human rights must be promoted , with special attention to the status of women , children and disadvantaged groups . 
The basic aim of integration of our countries at the present stage is to complete the creation of a Customs Union as a prerequisite for boosting our national economies , raising the standard of living of our peoples and achieving sustainable democratic development .  
These include the shelter , management and social reintegration of tens of thousands of displaced persons , a humanitarian tragedy whose scale has not always been clearly perceived by the international community ; the protection of people and property ; the respect of human rights ; and the restoration of normal living conditions in many war-torn communities an overwhelming task that anyone would agree requires means exceeding by far the capacities of a State bled dry such as Congo is today .  
To this end , we envisage measures to benefit all sectors of the older population , taking care to ensure that needs are met for those living in the countryside and in outlying urban areas , older women , disabled older persons and all groups of older persons who because of their race , culture , religion , economic situation or political ideas might have limited access to all kinds of services and comprehensive care .  
At its special session the General Assembly will have to adopt the goal of reducing by one half the percentage of those living in extreme poverty by 2015 ; this goal must become a commitment at the national level and a mandate for international institutions if we are to formulate the necessary global strategies .  
In the context of legislative and legal guarantees and taking into account the balance between the needs of the individual and those of society , my country has adopted several political , social and economic measures aimed at the maximum utilization of human resources and the improvement of living standards .  
Adopted in 1997 , after broad discussions with decentralized communities , civil society , the private sector and donors , this programme aims to improve the living conditions of the poorest population by increasing the income of the poor through the promotion of micro-enterprises and income-generating activities ; improving provision to meet basic social needs ; and establishing a permanent follow-up system on household living conditions .  
Since then , Egypt has embarked upon reforming its economy and has implemented structural adjustment programmes to achieve economic growth aimed at improving the living standards of the Egyptian people while establishing social safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable groups of our society .  
In this context , my delegation would like to point out the necessity of strict observance by all the Member States of the World Summit decisions , which assigned concrete tasks and defined common approaches towards ensuring further social progress and improving the living conditions of the people of the world .  
The blockade has created countless obstacles to Cubas economic development ; it has made it impossible for Cuba to acquire products , equipment , goods , services and technology ; it has deprived it of funding and credits ; it has inflicted severe damage on its foreign trade by depressing the prices of what we sell and raising the costs of imports and transportation ; it has affected every sector of the national economy , with severe consequences for the living conditions of our people .  
Let me refer to the European Union Common Position of 2 December 1996 , and reiterate on this occasion that the main objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of gradual and peaceful transition to pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people .  
The continuing sanctions and embargo imposed by the United States Government have posed great difficulties for the Cuban people in their endeavour to achieve economic and social development and reform , thus seriously constraining the Cuban Governments efforts to eradicate poverty and enhance its peoples living standards.Cuban women and children have borne the brunt of the suffering , especially in terms of their health and welfare . 
As we stand at the threshold of the new century , let us rededicate ourselves to demining activities so as to give peoples the opportunity to live in an environment free from the physical , socio-economic and psychological traps these killers create and to ensure that those now living with the threat of landmines will have the chance to enjoy a peaceful and productive existence .  
In my delegation ' s view , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a fundamental means of ensuring the peaceful and sustainable use and development of the oceans and their resources , through , in particular , the promotion of international cooperation , the equitable and efficient utilization and preservation of living marine resources , and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .  
Yet all these efforts have been frustrated by hostile and aggressive actions taken by the occupying Power , which , far from showing itself ready to negotiate , has continued its policy of illegal settlements and violation of international law and human rights of the Arab people who live the bitter reality of living under occupation .  
Notwithstanding historical and cultural traditions , by which elderly people have always been greatly respected , the improvement of their standard of living requires ongoing political efforts to mobilize and utilize available resources in the context of families , communities , civil organizations and the private sector .  
The population policy thus aims at improving standards of living and quality of life ; improving health and welfare through information and education ; further reducing fertility and mortality rates ; encouraging Kenyans to adhere to small family size ; promoting family stability while recognizing the rights of women and children ; and eliminating social and cultural practices that have a negative impact on women and girls .  
Although the number of people in Malta living below the acceptable national standard of living is about 1 per cent of the population , the Government continues to give special importance to social services and , within the constraints of a small island economy , social welfare programmes now provide an adequate safety net even for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged .  
What we all have in common is the wish and the request of peoples to have a better standard of living than they had in the past , real sustainable development and sustained growth in their countries and for their human rights and freedoms to be fully protected and observed .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
The Commission urges support , upon the request of the State concerned , for national efforts to gain greater access to resource information and to develop appropriate policies to facilitate the exploration and exploitation , with the States consent and in a manner consistent with the sustainability of marine living resources , of non-living marine resources within its exclusive economic zones , or to the outer limits of the continental shelf , wherever applicable .  
Stresses the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , including the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
Developing countries priorities are to eradicate poverty , with international support for achieving poverty reduction targets as agreed in United Nations conferences and summits , and improve standards of living , including meeting basic needs and lessening the burden of external debt , while taking all possible steps to avoid environmental damage and social inequity , for the furtherance of sustainable development .  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .

The poverty trap in which the poorest of the poor find themselves shows how human rights are indivisible and interdependent : the right to an adequate standard of living , to housing , to education , to work , to good health , to employment , to the protection of the family , to respect for privacy , to legal status and registration as a citizen , to life and physical integrity , to justice and participation in political , social and cultural life .  
The contribution of those living in extreme poverty could be of decisive importance in current thinking on sustainable human development and the right to development , especially since the concept of development is no longer viewed only from an economic standpoint , but also in social and cultural terms .  
The present section summarizes , by region and by sea , the main priorities and challenges , developments in decision-making , and activities at the national level to promote integrated coastal zone management , marine environment protection , and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources .  
Among the main concerns in the region are unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of those natural resources on which rural communities depend ; optimized use of land ; living conditions of coastal people ; insufficiently treated urban wastes , oil pollution and coastal erosion .  
The major interests at the international level are the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources and pollution by dumping of waste , protection of the sensitive environment of the Arctic Ocean , and exchange of scientific information on the oceans and its living resources .  
It is no longer acceptable or even practical to divide the international community into two distinct groupings : one living behind the walls of fortresses of alliances and weapons of mass destruction , while the security concerns of others are completely neglected as they are depicted as the source of possible threat and worthy of containment and deprivation . 
Promote , through educational and other programmes , efforts aimed at better informing the population about the urgent problems of environmental protection , rational nature management and improving the living environment for current and future generations.For the Republic of Kazakhstan : 
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
To secure , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
Her Government was committed to fighting poverty , inter alia by promoting the education and health of girls , enhancing their participation in the management of natural resources , improving their living conditions , combating violence against women , increasing their participation in decision-making and improving synergy among the relevant mechanisms for advancing the status of women .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Concerned also that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
In developing countries , such corruption may undermine economic development through a number of related factors : the misuse or waste of international aid ; unfinished development projects ; discovery and replacement of corrupt politicians , leading to political instability ; and living standards remaining below the countrys potential .  
The fact that the number of people worldwide living in abject poverty has increased is a clear signal of the imbalances and bias in the current global financial and trading system .  
We are of the view that illegal , unregulated , unreported fishing activities have a severe adverse impact on the effectiveness of measures for the sustainable management and exploitation of marine living resources .  
First , we have set an ambitious objective of cutting in half the percentage of people living in extreme poverty , stressing the necessary links between social and macroeconomic policies .  
We need societies where every single individual regardless of social status , gender , disability or ethnic or religious background is empowered to influence his or her living conditions for a better future .  
Among other things , world leaders committed themselves to creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that would enable people to achieve a better standard of living .  
Promoting community development , improving access to security of land tenure , housing and basic services , and fully integrating people living in poverty into economic , social and political life , which are crucial to sustainable development ;  
It would be possible for Equatorial Guinea to ensure , within a reasonably short period , the full realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights for the 450,000 inhabitants living in its territory of 28,000 square kilometres .  
At an international level , coordinated taxation of international capital flows and support for universal human rights to minimal standards of living would also contribute to improving income distribution .  
Recognizing the need for the realization of a standard of living adequate for the childs physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development , as well as the provision of universal and equal access to primary education ,  
On the other hand , mountainous countries and regions are populated by numerous ethnic groups and peoples whose traditional socioeconomic lifestyle enables them to adapt to and organize their vital activities in harsh living conditions .  
However , his Government was confident that with the support of civil society and the assistance of the United Nations specialized agencies , its efforts would lead to sustainable human development and improve the basic standard of living of its population .  
A major part of the worlds population still faced intolerable living conditions , which were further aggravated by the rapid pace of urbanization , increased poverty and the negative effects of globalization .  
During the initial phase , given the limited resources available , a range of measures is planned to halt the decline in the standard of living and the level of social protection of the population .  
The measures adopted to recognize and ensure the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the childs physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development ;  
The relevant indicators used to assess such an adequate standard of living , and its incidence among the child population , including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , social and ethnic origin , and family situation ;  
In Ecuador , a team of international and national UNV volunteers assisted indigenous communities living in areas afflicted by increasing poverty and environmental degradation .  
The most accurate assessment of the state of the economy is derived from the 1998 population census . 19 Some key comparisons with the previous census ( 1987 ) are set out below ; all these indicators show a steady improvement in the islands standard of living : 
Given the absence of a statutory minimum wage in the HKSAR , how does the Government determine whether average earnings are sufficient to secure an adequate standard of living for workers and their families ?  
There were tangible improvements in 1999 : wages in the public sector increased by 50 per cent ; scholarships were doubled ; pensions were indexed on a permanent basis and now almost equal the minimum standard of living .  
UNDP defines poverty as human poverty , deprivation in the most basic choices people have such as to live a long and healthy life , to be educated , to have the means to a decent standard of living and to be able to be a part of the life of a community . 
This instrument recognizes the right to an adequate standard of living , social security , the right to work and just and favourable conditions of work , and the right to education , in addition to traditional civil and political rights .  
Despite a desire to establish wages at a level commensurate with the people 's standard of living , this is conditioned by the economic power and financial possibilities both at macro and micro levels .  
The minimum standard of living is established on the basis of baskets of indispensable things such as food , clothing , lodging and items of hygiene , calculated according to the population segments in urban and rural areas .  
The constitutional provision on the right of the citizens to live in a healthy and safe environment may rightfully be regarded as a key requirement applied to housing which constitutes living space for a human being .  
By contributing to the Fund , donors express their solidarity with the victims , enabling them to receive medical , psychological , financial , social or legal assistance and thus to resume living a decent life .  
Contrary to the expectations of its population , the transition from a totalitarian to a democratic system based on the market economy is taking place during a profound economic crisis that has been accompanied by a marked reduction in living standards .  
These traditional values have formed a firm foundation which has yielded a prosperous nation with strong family bonds and leadership committed to raising the standard of living for all the nations citizens .  
The living conditions in this camp are harsh , especially for widows , elderly women and the many children , who often live in an intolerably precarious state , suffering from illnesses , malnutrition and the cold .  
In general , the Committees deliberations were taking place against a sombre backdrop half the worlds population living in absolute poverty , increasing numbers of homeless persons , a soaring population , rapid urbanization and the growth of megacities .  
It also imposed harsh restrictions that prevented the population living under occupation from farming and benefiting from its agricultural land , and destroyed mature , productive trees .  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of nondiscrimination ( art . 2 ) is not fully implemented for children living in the outer islands and in poor urban communities , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
The Committee notes with concern that children living in the outer islands do not have adequate access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources aimed at promoting the childs development and physical and mental health .  
The country with a relatively large , heterogeneous population living in crowded urban conditions did not possess sufficient resources to enable it to accept an uncontrolled influx of migrants without extensive social and economic disruption .  
The Minister defined the key objective of the Government as fighting poverty and improving the living conditions of the population by developing strong partnerships with the private sector , civil society and the donor community .  
The benefits derived from the mobilization of scarce financial resources via international capital flowing to the most productive uses have contributed to economic growth and increased standards of living in all regions of the world .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
A genuine and sustainable peace can be achieved only when proper living conditions are insured for all our inhabitants and when there is a sufficient level of economic development for everyone to meet his basic needs , when fundamental human rights are respected and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic channels .  
Finally , I would like to express our fervent hope that through the joint efforts of the two parties , assisted by the international community , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be ultimately resolved so that peace will return to the entire Middle East region and the peoples of Palestine and Israel will enjoy living side by side in their own countries , secure in peace , prosperity and dignity .  
In order to preserve equivalent standards of living at different offices , the Secretary-General may adjust the basic salaries set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the present annex by the application of non-pensionable post adjustments based on relative costs of living , standards of living and related factors at the office concerned as compared to New York . Such post adjustments shall not be subject to staff assessment .  
His Government planned to involve civil society , particularly non-governmental organizations , in implementing the new approach and was engaged in consultations with them on a number of issues ( inter alia , improving the living conditions of displaced persons in camps , protecting their civil rights , implementing job-creation projects for them , improving understanding of the basic principles of the new UNHCR approach ) .  
Individuals living in the contaminated areas showed increased morbidity due to diseases of the endocrine , circulatory and digestive systems , as well as a higher rate of mental disorders , but it was difficult to interpret those results .  
For this reason , the International Movement ATD Fourth World wishes to draw attention to the fate of millions of poor children born this year , who , owing to the slowness of the measures being implemented , will be lifelong victims of hunger ; to the millions of boys and girls forever deprived of an elementary education ; to the millions of parents living in roadside huts ; to the millions of fathers seeking work in vain ; and to the millions of mothers robbed of any hope of immediate improvement .  
The declaration should affirm the right of every human being hence , also those who are deprived of all their essential rights , wherever in the world they may be to live in an environment in which their human dignity is respected and to enjoy their fundamental rights fully and completely and thus be able to assume their responsibilities towards their families and communities .  It should take into account the efforts and initiatives of individuals and groups living in extreme poverty .  
While external financing was essential for achieving the rates of growth required to attain a marked improvement in living standards and a significant reduction of poverty in Africa , the inflow of foreign direct investment to the region was still very low , and Africa suffered from volatility in capital flows , as well as exchange rate instability and misalignment resulting from rapid liberalization of the capital account .  
To that end , the international community must take the economic , social and cultural aspects of human rights into account by promoting and implementing the relevant international conventions so that they could have a real impact on those rights and on the improvement of the living conditions of all people .  
For ethical and practical reasons , the vicious circle of poverty and lack of access to modern technological resources must be broken , and a virtuous circle established in which such technology made it possible to achieve better standards of living .  
Member States should be invited to consider adopting at the national level such measures , including legislation , that would ( a ) discourage all actions and activities , commercial or otherwise , that could be prejudicial to the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories ; and ( b ) promote full respect for the human rights of peoples living under foreign domination and facilitate their recourse to judicial proceedings in order to gain economic and social restitution .  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of non-discrimination is not fully implemented for non-citizen children , children belonging to minorities , including Roma children , poor or dysfunctional families , children with disabilities and children living in rural areas , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
In light of articles 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 and 27 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to take all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of its available resources , in particular at the local level , to support families in a difficult economic and / or social situation in order to ensure , to the maximum extent possible , the survival and development of all children living in Latvia .  
In light of its previous concluding observations and taking note of efforts by the State party to combat poverty and its negative effects on children , the Committee remains concerned at the large disparities in the enjoyment of economic and social rights , particularly health and education , by children living in rural areas and regions lagging behind in socio-economic development .  
In light of articles 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 and 27 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to take all appropriate measures , such as the adoption and enforcement of the Programme of Assistance to Families Raising Children , to the maximum extent of its available resources and in particular at the local level , to support families in a difficult economic and / or social situation in order to ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of all children living in Lithuania , without discrimination .  
The Committee is concerned , further , at the low standard of the living conditions in some alternative care institutions , the inadequate monitoring of placements and the limited number of qualified personnel in this field .  
The Committee remains deeply concerned at the weakness of family links , at the large numbers of children who have been deprived of a family environment and , in particular at reports regarding : difficulties and slow progress in tracing separated families and children ; the lack of adequate mechanisms of protection for children living in institutions ; the placement of children in institutions for long periods ; and the predominant use of placement in institutions in preference to the development of alternative care measures ( e.g . , adoption and foster care ) . 
Note with grave concern the negative effects on health and the environment of environmental racism suffered , in particular , by countries in Africa , including the illicit dumping of toxic wastes and substances , hazardous working and living conditions and dangerous methods of extracting natural resources .  
Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , peace , democracy , justice , equality , rule of law , pluralism , development , better standards of living and solidarity ,  
Tribute should be paid to the organizations of the United Nations system , Governments and the international community , especially non-governmental organizations , for the work they were doing to help , at both the psychological and the physical level , millions of children living in abject circumstances because they were victims of poverty , a precarious economic or social situation , sickness , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , disabilities or lack of legal protection .  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , peace , democracy , justice , equality , rule of law , pluralism , development , better standards of living and solidarity ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Calls upon all States to take all necessary measures to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by children with disabilities and , where necessary , to develop and enforce legislation against their discrimination to ensure dignity , promote self-reliance and facilitate the childs active participation in the community , including adequate and effective access to education of good quality for children with disabilities and their parents , taking into account the situation of children with disabilities living in poverty ;  
Mindful of the fact that the Asian and Pacific region has two thirds of the worlds population living under the absolute poverty level and the imperative of integrating environmental considerations into economic and social development , the programme will highlight a stronger poverty alleviation thrust , particularly in the areas of social development , population and rural and urban development , and environmental and natural resources management .  
The parliamentarians of the Republic of Belarus appeal to State parliaments and Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , business , financial , scientific and religious circles , social movements and funds , representatives of the mass media , their compatriots and all peoples of goodwill not to forget that the people of Belarus have been living in an environmental disaster area for many decades and need active assistance from the world community . 
This phenomenon of multiple job-holding is considered to be on the increase based on the observation of a local pollster , who points out that an increasing number of Jamaicans are being forced into additional employment on a part-time basis as a measure to counter the rising cost of living .  
Similarly , the Maintenance Act provides that parents have the responsibility to maintain their children , thus seeking to ensure that every child has a standard of living adequate for his physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development ( art .  27 ) .  
When the States adhered to the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in 1996 , they pledged to respect and guarantee to all individuals living in their territory , and who are under their jurisdiction , the rights recognized by the Covenant with no discrimination based on race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , social status , birth , or any other criteria .  
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
In the light of the International Bill of Rights , poverty may be defined as a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
While the rights enumerated in the Covenant , such as the right to an adequate standard of living , are of central importance to the poor , the Committee emphasizes that all civil and political rights , as well as the right to development , are also indispensable to those living in poverty.g  
In conclusion , anti-poverty policies are more likely to be effective , sustainable , inclusive , equitable and meaningful to those living in poverty if they are based upon international human rights .  
While we strive our best to mobilize domestic resources and to learn from best practices , the global community must help us with increased flows of official development assistance , better trading opportunities , expanded debt relief and support for institutional development so that our people , living in urban and rural areas alike , can lead a decent and productive life .  
Three basic acts a law on medicine , a law on epidemiological safety , and governmental regulations ensure that every member of society , including people living with HIV / AIDS , is entitled to access to information and education on health ; that HIV testing of an individual is voluntary and confidential ; that an infected individual may work at any trade or profession ; and that antiretroviral therapy for people with HIV infection is available free , so far .  
In May 2001 , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights adopted a statement on poverty which recognizes that poverty constitutes a denial of human rights and defines poverty as a human condition characterized by the deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ( A / CONF . 191 / BP / 7 ) .  
Recognizing that care , support and treatment can contribute to effective prevention through increased acceptance of voluntary and confidential counselling and testing , and by keeping people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups in close contact with health-care systems and facilitating their access to information , counselling and preventive supplies ;  
Affirming that beyond the key role played by communities , strong partnerships among Governments , the United Nations system , intergovernmental organizations , people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups , medical , scientific and educational institutions , non-governmental organizations , the business sector including generic and research-based pharmaceutical companies , trade unions , media , parliamentarians , foundations , community organizations , faith-based organizations and traditional leaders are important ;  
Refugees and displaced persons already for many years have been deprived of elementary living conditions and the exercise of the most fundamental human rights and freedoms , enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , including the right to live in dignity and safety and participate fully in social and economic life in their places of permanent residence .  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
The World Bank notes that if aggregate gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in developing countries over the next 15 years were to equal the average attained during the 1990s , then progress in poverty reduction would be even slower than in scenario B , and the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day at the end of the forecast period would be only marginally lower than in 1998 .  
Based on the recommendations of that meeting , ESCWAs work in the current biennium ( 2000-2001 ) is concentrated on policies to alleviate poverty , with emphasis on issues of poverty and youth , the role of income-generating activities among the poor , and improving the standards of living of local communities through microcredit lending and community development , based on an integrated regional training programme .  
Urgyen Trinley Dorje , the seventeenth living Buddha of the Karmapa order , left the Chub monastery in December 1999 with a small group of followers , leaving behind a letter in which he explained that he was going abroad to secure the traditional Black hat and sacred attributes of the living Buddha : In acting thus , I betray neither my country nor my people , nor my monastery nor its great priests . 
In keeping with its aim of overcoming economic , social and institutional obstacles that prevent the population from enjoying decent living conditions , the Government of the Republic is promoting a poverty-reduction strategy that includes short - , medium - and long-term goals .  Areas of action have been identified that call for both the State and society at large to work to reduce the magnitude of poverty , which affects the majority of the population .  
To ensure that public resources have an impact on the living conditions of the target population , studies are being conducted in connection with the third phase of the integrated financial administration system ( Sistema Integrado de Administracin Financiera SIAF ) , which is responsible for preparing and executing the national budget .  The aim is to incorporate decentralized , autonomous and local entities into the system so as to enhance effectiveness and guarantee transparency in public administration .  
A Commission for Social and Human Development has been set up and five key elements for the development policy have been defined : to satisfy at least the minimum requirement of Mexicans with respect to food , housing and education ; to apply a measure of equity in all government policies ; to focus on the population living in extreme poverty , particularly indigenous peoples ; to promote social cohesion and community spirit ; and to protect the environment .  
The Special Adviser attended the seventh annual Congress of the International Ombudsperson Institute held in Durban , South Africa , from 30 October to 2 November 2000 , where the participating Ombudspersons and national institutions agreed that living in a society that pursues good governance practices is a basic human right .  59 .

The coercive measures taken by the United States have prevented the Libyan people from obtaining the technology necessary to advance its economic and social development , and the freezing of its assets has deprived it of resources that were to have been spent to raise its standard of living and enhance its welfare .  
Moving beyond mere cohabitation and to achieve interpenetration and bring about a genuinely multicultural society would make mutual recognition and interaction an integral part of daily life for everyone - the mosaic being the harmonious living arrangement that needs to be developed .  
I would imagine that we would also agree that it was proper that this Conference should be held in South Africa , a country that has witnessed the most egregious form of institutionalized racism , yet rose to become a living testimony that racism can be defeated with the collective efforts of the international community .  Gathered at this Conference , as Member States , we have at some time or another stood at the precipice .

"  
In view of the drop in people 's income expectations and the rise in their expenditure expectations , and their insufficient consumption capacity , we raised the standard of the basic living needs of workers laid off from state enterprises , the unemployed , those urban residents eligible for the lowest basic living needs , and others on low incomes , and increased the wages of workers of organs , undertakings , and units , and the pensions of retired personnel .  
and the major measures should meet the requirements for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , planning state key construction projects well , effectively improving people 's living standards , actively promoting employment , and succeeding in social security work and sustainable development .  
Take our Jian area as an example : After reform and opening up , it practiced the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and the cooperative shares system and adopted multiple operational forms in the state-owned enterprises , so that the economic strength repeatedly increased , the people 's living standards were continuously enhanced , and the peasants ' per capita income grew from 130 yuan in 1978 to more than 2,000 yuan last year .  
and having heard and examined five special reports - - the State Council 's report on ensuring basic living allowance for people such as laid-off workers of state-owned enterprises , report on raising peasants ' incomes and reducing their burdens , report on building of public security contingents in recent years , report on management of the cultural market , and report on preventing and tackling atmospheric pollution in Beijing Municipality .  
For the past two years , facts have proved that the implementation of the proactive policy has achieved remarkable success .  Despite an increase in both the fiscal deficit and the size of debts , the implementation of the proactive policy has safeguarded social stability , maintained sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , and raised the living standard .  
The initial stage refers to the historical stage in which the situation of the impoverished population accounting for a large proportion and the people 's living standards being comparatively low will be gradually changed so that the entire people will become comparatively prosperous .  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , China has persistently followed the principle of national unity and common development and properly handled the relations among reform , development , and stability , thus ensuring the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy and the noticeable improvement of the people 's living standards .  
We should ensure availability and properly make use of funds needed for social insurance and the normal functioning of state organs , to ensure that basic living expenses of laid-off staff members and workers of state-owned enterprises , basic old-age pensions of retired personnel , minimum living expenses of urban residents , and wages of public functionaries , are disbursed in full and on time .  
Most comrades are now seizing time to study and work hard ; but , undeniably , there still exist many phenomena of not treasuring time : a lot of valuable time is wasted by overstaffing , buck-passing , mountains of documents , oceans of meetings , empty talk , platitudes , fault-finding , meaningless debate , blind decision-making , misguided and arbitrary command , absent-mindedness , doing nothing , extravagant living , and pleasure-seeking .  All this is truly painful to see and worrisome .  
Thanks to the achievements of modern science and technology , modern people enjoy a higher level of living standard .  Rapid progress has also been made in medical science .  With the exception of an extremely small number of complicated diseases that need more researches and studies to overcome them , common diseases can be cured by proper treatment .  
Now , the vast majority of the rest of the poor are those living in remote areas which are hard to get to and lacking in resources and where the ecological environment is extremely bad .  
It is even more important that in the 50 years since the founding of New China , particularly since the start of reform and opening up , the overall strength of our country has been remarkably enhanced , the people 's living standard is approaching a better-off level of moderate prosperity , and we have had a sufficient economic strength to increase our support to the Central Western Region ;  
It seems that the United States is only accustomed to a relationship in which it gives the orders and other countries obey , and is not yet accustomed to living on equal terms with other countries ; it is only accustomed to living in an impossible uniform world regulated by itself , and is not yet accustomed to living in the real pluralistic world .  
The telegram says : In the past 45 years , under the leadership of the Lao People 's Revolutionary Party , the people of all nationalities in Laos won a victory in national and democratic revolution , established the Lao People 's Democratic Republic , and continuously made new achievements in safeguarding national independence and state sovereignty and developing national undertakings .  In particular , since the initiation of the innovation and opening up drive , Laos has made ceaseless progress in all undertakings and made noticeable achievements in continuously improving the people 's living standards .  
First , it led the people to establish new China , thus putting an end to the history of being very much enslaved and plundered by foreign countries and savaged by one war after another and the masses living on the edge of starvation in old China and providing fundamental political premises , stable social environments , and excellent social conditions for the development of social productive forces in China .  
Since reform and opening up , the living standards of the people in our country have been constantly improving and the actual incomes of urban and rural residents rapidly increasing .  With the remarkable improvement in living conditions , the problem of food and clothing for the people in the whole country has been basically resolved and they are now even marching toward the comparatively well-off level .  
We succeeded in achieving the goal of quadrupling the value of the gross output on the basis of the 1980 figures ahead of time .  Moreover , while the population continued to grow , we also achieved the goal of quadrupling the per capita amount of the value of the gross national output , thus raising social productivity and the people 's living standards to substantively higher level .  
After this five-year plan is fulfilled , with the efforts of five more years , that is , by the year 2010 , we will establish a sound and perfect socialist market economic structure , and will further double the value of the gross national output on the basis of the 2000 figure , thus further enhancing the people 's living standards .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .

The track of Hu Changqing 's downfall once again warns us that because of the long-time environment of peaceful construction and the ever-improving living conditions , some people have grown indolent and have developed hedonistic tendencies and are harboring thoughts of loose living and idleness .  This is the main reason for the rampant corruption today .  
China is a socialist country ; it must strive to build strong state finance in order to press forward the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , continually enhance the material and cultural living standards of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and preserve social stability and state economic and national defense security .  
For the state to set aside some fiscal revenue to ensure the basic living needs and reemployment of laid-off state enterprise workers is not only the demand of implementing the party 's program of wholehearted service for the people , but is also the requirement of creating and stable social environment for the continued development of reform and construction .  
As a result of over 20 years of reform and development , there has been great improvement of our comprehensive national strength , social productive forces , and people 's living standards ; we have progressed by leaps and bounds in building socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and legal system ; and the whole world has seen the great vitality and vigor demonstrated by socialism in China .  
We are happy to see that Turkey 's people , with their own capable hands , obtained an outstanding accomplishment while in the midst of the process of building their own country .  The society is unceasingly progressing , the economy is rapidly developing , the living standard of the people is increasing day by day , and Turkey has already become a spectacular country in the international community .  
It is precisely because of the implementation of this policy that we have been able to break through the " egalitarianism " that has stifled us for many years , frustrating the people 's enthusiasm , and have been able to fully mobilize and stimulate the great enthusiasm and creativity of workers .  It has greatly liberated and developed productivity , continually raised the masses ' standard of living , and markedly strengthened overall national power .  
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
In the past two decades since the beginning of reform and opening up , our country 's overall national power has significantly strengthened , people 's living standard has been constantly improved and our international position had been greatly raised .  The most fundamental reason is due to the rapid and healthy economic and social development .  
We should combine that basis with the thinking of officers and men , carry out psychological adjustment education , provide guidance to officers and men to cultivate lofty ideals , for good mentality , for living well , and to help lay a solid ideological foundation for training " four haves " military personnel .  
in our country , social productivity , comprehensive national strength , and the people 's living standards were all raised to a higher and higher level ; gratifying reports came from all fronts ; our nation 's international status was obviously enhanced .  
China 's funds for national defense construction are all used for protecting state security and territorial integrity .  China keeps the army in condition but will not engage in unjust military ventures .  The limited military expenditures are used to raise the living standard of officers and soldiers and improve weapons and equipment .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , our comprehensive national strength continued to grow , the productivity continued to rise to a higher and higher level , and the people 's living quality also continued to improve .  The interests of the broadest people were continuously fulfilled and guaranteed .  The leadership of the CPC won heartfelt support of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  
Li Ruihuan said that China and Russia are facing huge domestic tasks in developing their economy and improving living standards , and they hold identical or similar views on many major international issues ; their two economies are strongly complementary , and there are broad prospects for developing bilateral friendly cooperation .  
Since the 1960s and 1970s , many countries and regions of Asia have taken a practical approach , implementing development strategies of catching up and surpassing , rising quickly from the post-war ruins , achieving sustained and rapid economic growth , greatly improving the standard of living of the people , and writing a new chapter in the promotion of world economic development .  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .  
The people are now seeking the enhancement of their life quality after they achieved quantitative satisfaction .  The broad masses have truly feel the great superiority of socialism from their personal experience in the great enhancement of their own living standards , and support socialism from the bottom of their hearts .  Socialism has won an extensive and profound mass foundation in China .  
Long fed up with noise caused by flight training of US military planes , some 5,500 Japanese citizens living near Kadena Air Base in Okinawa angrily filed a suit in Okinawa Prefecture Court on 27 March this year accusing the Japanese Government of an " illegal act " in allowing US forces to set up military bases in residential areas , calling on US forces to immediately cease night flights , and demanding 6 billion Japanese yen in reparation to victims .

The " three protection line " system of ensuring the basic living of the furloughed staff and workers from state-owned enterprises , providing unemployment insurance , and ensuring minimum living standard for residents living in urban areas has been basically established and the social insurance system mainly focusing on basic pension insurance , unemployment insurance , and basic medical insurance for staff and workers living in cities and towns has been initially set up .  
It has actively pushed forward the reform of retirement , unemployment , and medical insurance .  It has made concentrated efforts to ensure that the basic livelihood of laid-off SOE workers is guaranteed and that pensions are fully paid to the retirees , and to establish three safeguard systems , that is , the system for providing basic livelihood for laid-off SOE workers , the unemployment insurance system , and the system for guaranteeing the minimum living standards for urban residents .  
Ever since the beginning of reform and opening up , in particular , earthshaking changes have taken place in Sichuan . The province has deepened its reform , rapidly opened itself wider to the outside world , attained high-speed economic growth , brought about comprehensive progress to all its social undertakings , and has provided a comfortable living and working environment for its people .  The entire province is now enjoying a sound national unity , a stable political situation , and prevailing social stability .  
learn from his style of studying diligently , attaching importance to investigation and research , and working carefully and meticulously with fastidious attention , to denounce the unhealthy tendency of falsification and performing duties in a perfunctory manner ; and learn from his excellent quality of cleanness , uprightness , honesty , hard work , and thrifty living , to forever maintain the true political colors of plain living and hard struggle .  
Comrade Geng Biao upheld the policy of practicing economy while conducting diplomatic activities .  He was strict with himself and never gave any thought about personal fame and wealth .  He sought no privilege for himself and always maintained the distinctive political character of plain living and hard struggle .  
The standard of our productive forces has risen substantially ; we have further gained comprehensive national strength , and the people as a whole have attained a comfortable standard of living .  
It has accurately epitomized and given a high appraisal to the following three major changes in history .  Namely , the productive forces have been greatly intensified , and the people have generally attained a moderately high standard of living .  Also , three major changes have taken place in social and economic activities in market supply and demand , in institutional environment in economic development , and in economic relations with foreign countries .  
In resolving the existing outstanding problems in rural reform and development and achieving a new flying leap in China 's agriculture and rural economy , it is essential to regard development of the rural economy as the main theme , regard deepening the rural reforms and rejuvenating agriculture through science and technology as the motive force , and regard improving the basic living standards of the peasants as the fundamental starting point , and to do a great deal of work in all respects .  
Party committees and governments in all localities included the warmth-giving activities in their overall work arrangements .  In the whole country , 358,000 leading cadres at all levels set up fixed connection with 45,000 enterprises encountering business difficulties and 629,000 worker families living in difficult condition for helping and supporting them .  This further advanced the process of constantly carrying out the warmth-giving activities and institutionalizing such activities on the basis of taking them as regular social activities .  
The requirements for the " two guarantees " work should be invariably fulfilled , and the principal leaders of the party committees and governments in various localities should continue to take charge of this work firmly and effectively , further enlarge the coverage of social insurance , tighten the fund collection and handover in accordance with the law , achieve the goal of granting old-age pensions by society at large in a comprehensive way , and quicken the tempo of improving and perfecting the system to provide basic living expenses for urban residents .  
Our undertaking of reform , opening up and socialist modernization has been pushed forward into a new stage .  In China today , it is a scene of political stability , economic development , national unity , social progress , constantly improving living standard , and prosperity .  
Within a very short period of 20 years , Chinese economy made huge progress , the people 's living standards rose to a new height , and the integrated national strength made an enormous step forward .  
Based on the overall strategic plan for national economic and social development for the new period , in the next five to 10 years the tourist industry should play a more vigorous role in promoting reform and opening-up , implementing the policy of expanding domestic demand , accelerating economic restructuring , and improving the people 's living standards .  
To build on progress and create greater glories , we must consider the constant improvement of the people 's standard of living to be the fundamental starting point for all of our work .  While we continue to take care of everyday affairs for the people year after year , we must join together to make some major accomplishments that all of the people of Beijing can see and feel , and that will bring even more real benefits to the people in the city and in outlying areas .  
In the New Year editorial , the DPRK stated that it would , in the new year , " streamline the current economic foundation , carry out comprehensive transformation of the economy with modern technologies and methods , step up the building of power , coal , metallurgy , rail transport sectors , increase agricultural production , develop the light industry , and raise the people 's living standards . "  
Researchers Pan Houren and Zhou Jiahua held that today , when material living standards are improving all the time , it is extremely important to build a rich and excellent cultural life ; the current measures such as small district sports and public welfare facilities which are now being built in a big way , and the rural cultural activities launched by organizing peasants who have become rich are extremely beneficial .  
In Chinese society today when we are carrying out socialist modernization , the greatest benevolence is whatever is beneficial for developing the social productive forces , increasing all-round national strength , and improving living standards ; otherwise , a thing is non-benevolent or is evil .  
We hope various levels of party committees and governments across the autonomous region will earnestly put into effect the party 's policies toward agricultural and pastoral areas and unite and lead the broad masses of cadres to develop production , improve living standards , " bring social order out of chaos , " and " tackle problems caused by stupidity , " so that our region will advance by leaps and bounds and achieve prolonged political stability .  
During these five years China has enjoyed political stability , economic development , social progress , and ethnic solidarity ; all-round national strength has risen to a new level , living standards have on the whole reached a comfortably well-off level , and we have victoriously achieved the second strategic goal in socialist modernization .  
Only when development is accelerated can the living standards of the people of all nationalities in our region be improved and the increasingly growing needs of material and cultural life be met , and only when development is accelerated can the new-type socialist nationality relationship characterized by equality , unity , and mutual help be consolidated and developed and national solidarity be consolidated and enhanced .  
Given a land mass constituting only 7 percent of the world 's farming area , China has successfully resolved the issue of basic needs for a population making up 22 percent of the world population .  The number of impoverished persons has decreased considerably and the people 's standard of living has improved significantly .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
Luo Gan said : Ever since the Central Committee held its third meeting to discuss projects to be launched in Tibet , Tibet autonomous region , as result of doing its jobs while adhering to the Central Committee 's lines and general and specific policies , has been able to enjoy one of its best periods in history in terms of economic development , social stability , national unity , strong border defense , and people 's living conditions .  
Therefore , we must , through constant efforts , further liberalize thinking , renew ideas , expand efforts to open up to the outside , seize opportunities , and accelerate development so as to bring more visible and tangible benefits to the Tibetan people and increasingly improve the material and cultural standard of living for the people .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States has indeed enjoyed nearly 10 years of sustained economic growth , but in respect of citizens ' rights of existence , the gap between rich and poor in American society is growing and the population living in poverty is increasing .  
It firmly takes the steady improvement of the living standards , both material and cultural , of the urban and rural populations as the essential demand of socialism , the fundamental goal of economic development , and the meeting point of the effort to properly handle the relations among reform , development , and stability .  It gives priority to resolving the problems that are of widespread concern to the ordinary people ;  
Efforts will be made to properly handle the relationship between reform , development , and stability , create more jobs , perfect the social security system , rationally regulate income distribution , keep improving people 's living standard , strengthen the building of clean government , tackle problems of common concern among the masses , and bring stability and harmony to the entire society .  
Over 90 percent of the detachments under the battalion level in the whole army have fulfilled the comprehensive management of barracks .

The delegation also held special report sessions on " opposing evil cult , guaranteeing human rights " for Chinese students studying in France and for overseas Chinese living and working in France .

Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
We shall takedevelopment as a main theme , take restructuring as a main line , take reform , opening-up , scientific and technological innovations as driving forces , andtake the enhancement of the people 's living standards as a fundamental startingpoint , continue to promote comprehensive economic and social development .  
Jiang Zemin said : " Uruguay is beautiful and fertile .  It has long-term political stability and sustained economic development .  The people 's living standard has continued to rise and the country has played a positive role in international affairs .  
People of countries the world over , politicians , political parties , social groups , and media of many countries including the United States , and overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have made speeches and published articles supporting the Chinese Government 's just stance and the spirit of struggle in showing no fear of mighty power , attacked the unreasonable and unjustified US attitude , and exposed the US conspiracy to trample on the sovereignty of other countries and establish world hegemony .  
It is precisely at this crucial moment that Comrade Jiang Zemin made the remark that the Communist Party of China must represent the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  He has enriched the political connotation conducive to raising the people 's living standards , and turned the reconstruction of the mode of cultural life and the expansion of advanced culture into the process of China 's modernization drive .  As a result , he has provided China with more attractive cultural resources .  
In one way or another , overseas Chinese and Chinese nationals living in different parts of the world condemned the conduct of the US military reconnaissance plane of ramming into and destroying the Chinese aircraft .  They firmly supported the Chinese Government 's just stand , and they extended their respects to heroic pilot Wang Wei , whose whereabouts were still unknown .  
He fully expressed the lofty demeanour of a proletarian revolutionary and the fine work style of a Chinese communist by his hard work and plain living , modesty and prudence , diligence and pragmatism , and selfless devotion .  
Comrade Wang Wei had ambitious revolutionary ideals and a lofty spirit of dedication .  He set a fine example in living up to our army 's fundamental purpose and faithfully carried out our army 's fundamental function and thus was an outstanding representative of revolutionary servicemen of the new generation .  
He was hard working and plain living , modest and prudent , strict with himself and lenient toward others , honest in performing his official duties , and esteemed and loved by the broad masses of cadres and people .  
The percentage of China 's poverty-stricken population has been lowered to the lowest level in history and the standard of living of the people has been greatly improved .  We have made a leap from being poor to having sufficient food and clothing and another from having sufficient food and clothing to living a relatively well-off life .  
Since the Eighth CPV National Congress , the CPV has continued to uphold Marxism-Leninism , Ho Chi-minh thought , and the CPV 's leadership , adhered to the socialist road , and carried out sweeping reform with determination , thus maintaining stability of the country ; and , as a result , Vietnam 's economy has been growing relatively rapidly , its people 's living standards have been continuing to improve , and its international status has been further rising , demonstrating the great vitality and vigor of the socialist system .  
It is hoped that implementing the great western development will gradually narrow the gap between the living standards in the east and the west and bring dramatic changes to the troops ' work and living environment as a result , and the masses of officers and men who have planted roots in the west to devote themselves to our national defense will become even more enthusiastic and energetic .  
From bustling cities to remote countryside , from gray-haired elderly people to children , and from people of all nationalities at home to overseas Chinese and people of Chinese origin living abroad - - everyone 's heart was with Wang Wei , everyone 's attention was drawn to the South China Sea , and everyone kept a close eye on every development and news about the rescue work .  
The Party 's Central Committee and the State Council place a high level of emphasis on these issues and are extremely concerned with safeguarding the lives of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and their re-employment .  They are speeding up implementation of social security system reform and have done a great deal of highly effective work to bring about the two ' guarantees ' ( guaranteeing the basic living expenses of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and guaranteeing the on-time issue and proper amount of old age pensions for retired workers ) .  
At Juncheng Township which was the site of the headquarters of the Jin-Cha-Ji [ Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei ] Military District , Wen Jiabao held cordial talks with veteran fighters of the Eighth Route Army who had taken part in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the mass production movement in Yanan . Wen Jiabao inquired about the living conditions of the local people in details and took part in a discussion meeting with local cadres and masses on current rural work .  
Li Ruihuan said : We are glad to see that the Libyan people , under the leadership of Qadhafi , selected a path of development suited to the national conditions and achieved distinguished results in safeguarding national independence and sovereignty , developing the national economy , and improving the people 's living conditions .  
Since the start of reform and opening up , especially since the third central conference on work in Tibet , various undertakings have surged forward full of vigor , the outlook of urban and rural areas has changed greatly , and people 's living standards have been raised .  All those are unprecedented in the history of Tibet .  
Raidi pointed out : In Tibet , there is now smooth administration , all kinds of businesses are thriving , the society is stable , people of various nationalities are united , border defense has been consolidated , and people are living in peace and happiness .  Tibet is now in the best period of development since peaceful liberation in terms of social stability and economic development .  
When answering the question " what do you think deserves the most earnest congratulations in the 50 years since Tibet 's peaceful liberation , " 90 percent of the residents ' answer was : the shattering of the yoke of the feudal serfdom .  As a result , a-million serfs have stood up and have been masters of their fate .  They are now living an equal , harmonious , and independent new life .  
Accompanied by Hubei Governor Zhang Guoguang and other comrades , Luo Gan conducted investigation and study of the progress of the struggle to strike hard and put things in order from 11 to 15 May . He inspected units such as police substations , criminal police units , prisons , reform-through-labor camps , shopping malls , residential living quarters , and large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises , and paid a cordial call to express solicitude for the family members of a model public security policeman who died while on duty .  
Raidi , chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People 's Congress , noted : " Tibet is at its best time in history , for it now enjoys sound social progress , economic growth , and national unity ; its border defense remains strong and consolidated ; and its people are living a prosperous and content life .  All this does not come easily . "  
It has been more than a month since the national work conference on rectifying and standardizing market economic order was held .  During that period , all localities and all departments have been conscientiously living up to the spirit of the central work conference in light of local conditions and taken effective and concrete measures to launch market economic order rectification work , with emphasis on investigating a number of major and large cases , with some initial success .  
we must adhere to the guiding principle of " one central task , two important jobs , and three assurances , " i.e . , we should regard economic construction as the central task , closely attend to maintaining stability and developing the economy , and ensure long-term social peace and stability in Tibet , ensure the rapid development of Tibet 's economy , and ensure notable improvement of the living standard of the people of Tibet ;  
Over the past few years , in order to seek the status as a so-called " independent political entity " in the international arena , the Taiwan authorities , in the name of expanding " international living space , " have devoted massive manpower and material and financial resources to pursuing " money diplomacy . "  
Under the guidance of the " 17-point agreement , " the people in Tibet drove out the imperialist invading forces , put an end to the state of permanently being backward , sealed off , and stagnant , and made great progress which has attracted worldwide attention in the short period of 50 years .  The economic development , social progress , and remarkable improvement in the living standards of the people are trends of history .  
All of the 62 engineering projects which were built with aid from the whole country to Tibet have already been delivered for use , the situation of infrastructures in Tibet like transportation , energy resources , and communications lagging seriously behind has been greatly improved , its priority industries have been developed , and the living standards of the people have been further increased .  These are vivid embodiments of the central authorities applying the ideology of development to direct the work in Tibet .  
We must persist in focusing our vision on enhancing the overall qualities of the rural grassroots cadres , on resolving current conspicuous problems in the rural areas , and on safeguarding and developing the interests of the peasants ; in particular , we should do a number of practical things centering on rural economic development , to improve rural production and living conditions and make efforts to increase peasant incomes .  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
Their arduous efforts have brought about a great change in the look of poor areas : Their production means and living conditions have been markedly improved ; their production level raised by a big margin ; and great progress has been made in the scientific and technological , educational , cultural , and public health fields .  
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
Raidi , chairman of the Tibet regional people 's congress standing committee , said : Currently Tibet is in the best period in history .  Tibet has been enjoying social progress , economic prosperity , and ethnic unity ; frontier defense in Tibet is ensured ; people of Tibet have been living and working in peace and contentment ; and the anti-splittism struggle has developed from being in a passive position and taking measures to cope with emergencies to taking the initiative to deal with things .  These achievements have not come by easily .  
During the last 50 years , thanks to the concern of the central authorities and the support of the people in the rest of the country , the party , the government , the military , the police , and the people were united as one and worked hard and perseveringly to accomplish the tremendous achievement of rapid economic development , all-round social progress , and continuous improvement in the people 's living standards .  The entire region has gone through earth-shaking changes .  
We must always uphold the guidelines for work in Tibet during the new period formulated at the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , which call for " taking economic construction as the central task ; firmly focusing on the two major tasks of developing the economy and stabilizing the situation ; and ensuring Tibet 's accelerated economic development , all-round social progress , lasting peace and stability , and continuous improvement of the people 's living standards . "  
We will focus firmly on the central task of developing the western region on a large scale ; persistently follow the guidelines for work in Tibet in the new period ; and make the acceleration of development the main theme , the expansion of an economy characteristic of Tibet and economic restructuring the masterstrokes , the reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force , and the improvement of the people 's living standards the basic point of departure .  
Only evaluating " horses " will be tantamount to give the power of initiative on personnel training to history , making the difficult process of personnel training a process of living or dying without external interference .  When there is an urgent need , there will be shortages of needed personnel , and it then becomes necessary to pick the taller ones among short people .  
This partnership is aimed at pursuing common development through increased bilateral cooperation , proceeding from the reality that both China and Venezuela are developing nations faced with the task of expediting economic development to raise the living standards of the people .  
Hu Jintao pointed out : Since the beginning of this year , the whole party and the whole nation have been conscientiously implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee and the party Central Committee 's major policy decisions and vigorously advancing the drive for socialist modernization by persistently taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal .  
He further hoped that the quality education base for youths and the science and technology hall will extend the quality education of schools and allow every middle and elementary school student to be trained and nurtured in creative thinking , willpower and moral character , physical health , environmental protection sense , and capability in practical living .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that the party Central Committee and General Secretary Jiang Zemin pay great attention to the development of minority ethnic groups and areas inhabited by them and are concerned about improving the living standard of minority ethnic groups .  An important focus of attention and starting point in implementing the strategy of developing the western region is to help areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups develop faster .  
Similarly , it is impossible for Hong Kong to turn a blind eye to Falungong , which has been increasingly involved in political and international affairs and has disturbed the normal living order of citizens .  The HKSAR Government must assume responsibility for the security and stability of Hong Kong . Hence , the government 's stance and methods are totally reasonable and necessary .  
To carry out economic construction as the central task is the basic means and fundamental way out for us to break free of poverty and backwardness , attain all-round social progress in Tibet , constantly satisfy the people 's needs materially and culturally , ensure a constant improvement in the people 's living standard and join the rest of the country in achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living .  
Use Marxist materialist conception of history to gradually weaken idealist theism , replace feudalism and superstition and ignorance and backwardness with modern knowledge in science and technology , divert the attention of religion believers toward developing the economy and improving living standard materially and culturally , and guide religion into categories compatible with the socialist society for the temples , monks and nuns to play a positive and useful role in social life .  
In the view of sociology , no country or nation has a tradition , custom , daily life habit or style of living that will remain forever unchangeable .  Everything will change with economic and social development and change in people 's concept .  It is the law governing the course of history that fine customs compatible with social progress will be preserved while the backward habits that impede social progress will be discarded .  
The CPC , which had captured victory nationwide , was faced with a daunting challenge : Can it create advanced productive forces on the basis of old China , where poverty and backwardness had been endemic , and raise the living standard of the masses ?  " A serious economic construction task confronts us . "  
The Chinese government will continue to make development the main theme , make structural adjustment the main line , make reform and opening up and technical progress the motivation , make raising the people 's living standards the fundamental objective , and industriously take steps forward for economic development and social advance .  
The fourth is the tradition of deep affection for the motherland and hometown .  They constantly show concern for the economic , political , and social development of the motherland , as well as the living conditions of their beloved ones , consider it as an honor to be able to make contributions to their fellow countrymen , and take pride in the magnificent and long-standing history and culture of their nation .  
Without enhancing the level of productive forces , it is impossible to consolidate the political power , maintain social stability , improve the living standards of the people , and develop the spiritual civilization and the democratic and legal system .  
He said , overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have transnational culture , and there are also many specialized talented people among them ; there are more than 100,000 highly talented Chinese in science and technology and various specialities in North America ; this is advantageous for the United States in opening up the China market , for China 's economic construction , and for ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese to develop their business .  
The overall standard of living has already reached a well-off level and China now has a considerable group of wealthy people .  The objective for the second strategic step of socialist modernization has been realized in a general fashion .  
Jiang Zemin said that we can sum up the basic experience of our Tibet work in the following main areas : first , persist in making economic construction the focus , closely seizing upon the two major events of economic development and situational stability , and adhering to the guiding principles of the three safeguards which are safeguarding accelerated economic development and the overall social progress in Tibet , safeguarding national security and long-term stability in Tibet , and safeguarding a constantly improving standard of living for the people of every nationality in Tibet ;  
The guiding ideology of the party Central Committee toward strengthening Tibet work is to regard Deng Xiaoping theory and the party 's basic line as the guidance , persist in making economic construction the focus , closely seize upon the two major events which are economic development and situational stability , adhere to the three safeguards which are safeguarding accelerated economic growth and overall social progress in Tibet , safeguarding national safety and long-term stability in Tibet , and safeguarding constant improvements in the standard of living for the people of every nationality in Tibet .  
We must further liberate thinking , renew ideas , persist in regarding development as the theme , structural readjustment as the base line , liberalized reforms and scientific and technological progress as the driving force , and improvement of the people 's standard of living as the fundamental starting point , use creative thinking to resolve the prominent issues arising in the process of economic and social development in Tibet , and put into place good cycles in Tibet work .  
Over the past 80 years , under the leadership of the glorious CPC , the Chinese people have struggled hard and won great victories in revolution for national liberation , founded the People 's Republic of China , scored tremendous achievements in socialist construction , especially in the cause of reform , opening up and the socialist modernization drive , constantly improved people 's living condition , and continuously raised international its position .  
Since the founding of New China , the economy and society have developed rapidly ; the country has become increasingly prosperous ; the people 's social status , living standards and cultural and educational level have risen markedly .  
In keeping with the economic , political and cultural requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , all comrades in the party and all people in the country should strive to achieve the development goals set for the Tenth Five-Year Plan . We should focus on development through economic restructuring and by relying on reform , opening up and scientific and technological progress with a view to improving people 's living standards and constantly pushing for economic growth and social progress .  
The party 's policy to get the population rich must be adhered to .  On the basis of economic growth , efforts should be made to increase income for urban and rural residents , constantly improve their living conditions , including food , clothing , housing , transport and daily necessities , improve the social security system , and medical and health facilities , with a view to bettering their life .  
It is implementing the reform and opening up policy that spurred the national economy to develop in a sustainable , rapid and healthy manner and raised the social and productive forces , overall national strength and people 's standard of living to higher levels .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that China and India are two biggest developing countries of the world .  Both of them face the tasks of developing the economy and improving the people 's living standard and need a peaceful and stable surrounding environment .  
On the basis of economic development and social progress , it is necessary to increase the income of urban and rural residents , continuously raise the people 's living standards and life quality , and continuously enable the people to gain better and solid economic , political , and cultural benefits .  
We have seen clearly that the poor level of productive forces is a major factor that determines people 's willingness in having children .  In view of this , China has worked out its population program and population policies that conform with reality , which have not only successfully ensured healthy development for the country 's population and family planning undertaking ; but has also served to promote the country 's economic growth , push forward social progress , improve the living standards of the people , and enhance the country 's comprehensive national strength .  
Under the strategic plan of " a small change every year , a medium change every three years and a big change by the year 2010 " put forward by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee , Guangzhou has devoted great efforts to the development and comprehensive improvement of its urban environment in its endeavor to provide its people with a more comfortable living environment .  
The foreign policy must serve the needs of domestic development : making the country strong and prosperous , developing the economy , and improving the living standard of the people .  
We have won the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games . This shows that the international community has acknowledged the fact that China is marked by social stability and progress , its economy is prospering , and its people are living a peaceful and comfortable life .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
In the more than 50 years since the founding of the PRC , especially in the more than 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the Chinese people , under the leadership of the CPC , have continued their advance along the road of development they chose themselves ; China 's economic strength , national defense capacities , and scientific and technological strength have greatly increased ; and the people 's standards of living have noticeably improved .  
We have laid down a plan for national economic and social development for the coming five years .  We will persistently take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal and continue to push forward reform , opening up , and the modernization drive .  
These units have also provided many good farming and breeding skills for Tibet residents without compensation .  These years , they have changed their assistance steps and methods in a timely manner .  They have depended on their farms and production bases and exploited their professional , technological , and equipment advantages to translate many research achievements into social productive forces , thus greatly promoting the development of society , the economy , and productive forces of Tibet as well as the improvement of people 's living standards .  
This is evidenced by , among other things , its increasingly rapid economic growth , significant improvement of its people 's living standards , remarkable achievements in its building of advanced socialist culture and ethics , and vigorous development of all its social undertakings .  
Although technology objectively has a negative impact on the environment , this negative viewpoint is basically a flimsy excuse .  With the economic development and the people 's understanding being raised to a higher and higher level , the people will make a higher and higher demand for a quality life and a healthy , comfortable environment .  This will basically restrict the living space of the technology featuring excessive exploitation of natural resources and will help promote the development of environmentally friendly technology .  
Raidi emphatically pointed out : Although the Western hostile forces have clung to their ambitious designs of splitting Tibet from China , and the task to fight against " Tibet independence " is still vary arduous , the autonomous regional government has confidence that it will overcome all obstacles , accelerate economic development and social progress in Tibet , and raise the people 's living standard .  
After the trials of training in high temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius and frigid cold of 30 degrees Celsius below zero ; after successively moving across Bohai , Donghai , Nanhai , and other sea areas ; after undergoing rigid training and roughing it out , the Navy Marines of our army have now found an operational program that is suitable for moving , eating , living , and fighting in all kinds of weathers and environments under the condition of modern warfare .  They have also mastered the skill of fighting in complicated regions .  
Yang Xueyi , associate research fellow of the " 18 September Historical Museum , " briefed that after the " 18 September Incident , " the Japanese aggressor troops engineered a series of atrocious massacres in Liaoning . On 16 September 1932 , the Japanese army carried out a barbarous policy of burning and killing .  About 3,000 innocent ordinary people living in the neighborhood of Pingding Shan in Fushun were killed and all the houses were burned down .  
Specifically speaking , it is necessary to create a rather positive working environment , a harmonious and agreeable environment of interpersonal relationships , an academic environment that is democratic and lively , a rather comfortable living environment , and a social environment that is respectful and understanding .  
Governments at all levels should show deep care for the people , always care about the well-being of the working masses living in difficult conditions , fully rely on the masses , rely on the community management organizations , do careful and meticulous work , find out the concrete conditions of the people living in difficult conditions , effectively arrange the necessary funds needed by the issuance of minimum livelihood allowances through adjusting the structure of financial revenue and expenditure .  
As far as the whole country is concerned , the primary task at present is to unswervingly implement the central authorities ' current social security policies and measures , do a really good job in the " two assurances " work , and ensure that the basic living needs of laid-off workers from state enterprises and the basic pensions of retired workers are paid on time and in sufficient amount ; we absolutely can not have new debts arising in this respect .  
Zhu Rongji said , the CPC Central Committee and State Council are very concerned for Guizhou 's economic and social development ; we hope that the provincial party committee and government will seriously implement General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's demands on " three represents , " and lead the people of all nationalities in the province to work with concerted efforts , engage in pioneering and innovation , and speed up the building of a beautiful new Guizhou with prosperous economy , social progress , and people of all ethnic groups living in harmony .  
It is a period of the CPC leading the Chinese people to instigate to materialize national prosperity and strength and shared prosperity among people during reforms and opening up to the outside world , to construct a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  The CPC has made great achievements that attracted worldwide attention during its modernization process , and remarkably raised the social productivity and overall national strength , the people 's social status , living standards and material and cultural level .  
Since the founding of New China , the economy and society have developed rapidly ; the country has become increasingly prosperous ; the people 's social status , living standards and material and cultural level have risen markedly .  
We must perceive the major political , economic , cultural , and science and technology changes that have taken place in the world since the publication of the " Communist Manifesto " 150 years ago ; we must perceive the major changes that have occurred in China 's socialist construction ; and we must perceive the major changes that have taken place in the working and living conditions and social environment of the party members , cadres , and masses .  
However , restricted by communications and telecommunication conditions , a vast number of farmers and herdsmen living in the remote mountainous areas and rural areas have been unable to accurately learn in a timely fashion the party 's and state 's principles and policies .  
However , it was utterly impossible for China , overwhelmed by a dark political situation and turmoil and chaos of war , with the masses living in dire poverty and in a miserable state , to catch up with the advanced trend of developing science and technology in the world .  
At a briefing to Chinese and foreign reporters today , Liu Hong , director of the State Statistics Bureau , said : In 1999 , China 's economy grew steadily ; the residents ' living standards continued to improve ; the financial , securities , and insurance industries were continuously standardized and developed ; social undertakings made new advances ; and environmental protection was further strengthened .  
On its economic and social fronts , China successfully met its preset targets for economic growth , its exports ceased to fall and began to pick up , its financial revenue enjoyed a stable growth , an increase was registered in the economic returns of state enterprises , and the living standards of the people are undergoing a continued improvement .  All these were remarkable work results that had attracted people 's attention .  
The implementation of the proactive fiscal policy has protected social stability , maintained the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy , and improved the people 's living standards although it has also increased deficits and debts .  
When asked about the current state of the boy designated by the Dalai as the " reincarnated soul boy " of the Panchen , Raidi said : The " reincarnated soul boy " of the Panchen proclaimed without authorization by the Dalai in 1995 is against religious rules and is illegal .  The boy is living a very happy life , is receiving education , and is growing up in a healthy manner .  He is now a primary school student .  
At this year 's " two sessions , " the government has proposed that " full consideration should be given to the people 's capability of adapting themselves to the reform while carrying out reforms , and the expenses originally borne by the state and social institutions can not be shifted to the people . "  The government has also emphasized that the basic living standards of the disadvantaged people should be guaranteed , and a social security system should be established and improved .  NPC deputies and CPPCC members have recognized this .  
In the past year , while developing its economy and improving the people 's standard of living , China has also attached great importance to building democracy and the legal system as well as to promoting and protecting civil and political rights .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .  
The current phenomena of inadequate effective demand and excess of some products and production capacities have emerged under the condition of low social productive forces and low overall living standards of the people .  
Under the support of the Central Government , Tibet has attained economic development and social progress .  Tibet has been improving its people 's living standards ; remarkably advanced its ethnic culture , education , and public health ;  
However , restricted by communications and telecommunication conditions , a vast number of farmers and herdsmen living in the remote mountainous areas and rural areas have been unable to accurately learn in a timely fashion the party 's and state 's principles and policies .

The boy is living a very happy life , is receiving education , and is growing up in a healthy manner .  He is now a primary school student .  
At this year 's " two sessions , " the government has proposed that " full consideration should be given to the people 's capability of adapting themselves to the reform while carrying out reforms , and the expenses originally borne by the state and social institutions can not be shifted to the people . "  The government has also emphasized that the basic living standards of the disadvantaged people should be guaranteed , and a social security system should be established and improved .  NPC deputies and CPPCC members have recognized this .  
In the past year , while developing its economy and improving the people 's standard of living , China has also attached great importance to building democracy and the legal system as well as to promoting and protecting civil and political rights .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .  
The current phenomena of inadequate effective demand and excess of some products and production capacities have emerged under the condition of low social productive forces and low overall living standards of the people .  
Under the support of the Central Government , Tibet has attained economic development and social progress .  Tibet has been improving its people 's living standards ; remarkably advanced its ethnic culture , education , and public health ;  
The first group of county ( municipal ) " three stresses " educational work have the following special characteristics : First , through emphasis on taking hold of theoretical learning , in particular conscientiously learning Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important ideology of the " three represents " , leading cadres have received a rather systematic theoretical education .  Second , leading cadres are living in the villages and going into the households resulting in extensive arousal of the masses to action , introduction of the " three stresses " , and warm welcomes by the masses .  
In the more than 50 years since the founding of New China , especially in the 20-odd years since the start of reform and opening up , our country 's productive forces have developed rapidly , our overall national strength has noticeably increased , the people 's living standards have generally improved , the unity of nationalities has been continuously strengthened , social stability has prevailed , our country 's international prestige has steadily grown , and China has now become one of the countries which have developed fastest in the world .  
Nevertheless , with a guilty conscience , he did not dare to use expressions like " two countries " but carefully chose a neutral expression such as " the two sides of the Taiwan Straits . " He said that " the same historical experiences should have laid a solid foundation for the people living on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits to gain mutual understanding and commonly seek freedom , democracy , human rights , . .  
Relevant responsible comrades from the relevant departments under the State Council and from some provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , including Beijing , Hebei , Inner Mongolia , Liaoning , and Shaanxi , reported on their efforts to ensure the payment of old-age pensions to retirees and basic living allowances to laid-off workers .  They also set forth suggestions on further improving the social security system .  
Wei Jianxing pointed out : China and Indonesia , both important developing countries , are facing the same tasks of invigorating the economy , improving people 's standards of living , and safeguarding the just rights and interests of developing countries .  There exist enormous potential and a bright future for their cooperation in wide-ranging areas .  
No loopholes should be left in social security funds , the practice of " paying and allocating funds for the balance " of basic old-age insurance premiums must be resolutely put an end to , and the contributions of funds by society at large should be realized as soon as possible to ensure that basic living expenses for staff and workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and the old-age pensions for retirees are paid on time and in full .  
Beijing Municipality in recent years has achieved new vistas in revolution and liberalization , and its economic development is flourishing .  The standard of living of the people has been steadily rising , and there have been many positive changes in the face of the city , with more parks , green spaces , and beautification projects being undertaken .  The city 's air quality has also improved , opening the way for some new weather phenomena there .  
Countries differ in many ways , in their social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural heritage , economic development , standard of living , religious beliefs , and values .  Therefore , it is not possible to expect all countries to develop after a single model or system .  
With 10 percent of the global arable land , China has managed to meet the basic needs for food and clothing of its population , which is 22 percent of the global population .  The living standard of the urban and rural population is increasing steadily .  
In the past 50 years , the Chinese Government has not only basically provided enough food and clothing for 1.2 billion people and greatly raised the people 's living standards , but also allowed the people to enjoy civil , political , economic , social , cultural , and educational rights on the basis of the Constitution and law .  We can say that China 's current human rights situation is in the best period in history .  
Now , under the financial support of the central government , the Tibet autonomous region has experienced economic development unimaginable previously and the living standard of the people has been greatly raised .  
As everyone knows , the Korean Peninsula was divided by the international agreement into two independent countries that are not subordinate to each other .  They follow two different social systems , and their living standards also differ greatly .  However , both the North and the South are not opposed to the reunification in the future despite their differences in the " systems " and " living standards . "  
The government is extremely concerned about the establishment and perfection of a system of social security .  Last year , a total of 2.81 million urban residents received a minimum living benefit , for a total value of 1.969 billion yuan over 667 cities and 138 counties nationwide .  
The criteria for judging all party tasks should be whether they are conducive to liberating and developing the productive forces ; to reinforcing the comprehensive national strength of a socialist state ; and to raising the living standard .  
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
and improving the people 's living standard and safeguarding social stability .  With a conscientious and responsible attitude , we have implemented well the positive fiscal policies and worked hard to give play to the role of the treasury in macroregulation and control ;  
increased wages for personnel at institutions ; improved the three social security levels , namely basic living subsidies for laid-off workers at state enterprises , unemployment insurance , and minimum living allowance for city and town dwellers , and the treatment for retirees ; and paid retroactively overdue pensions to retirees at state enterprises in order to boost residents ' purchasing power and expand consumer demand .  
participating in the study and formulation of the scientific and rational social security payment standard and level to guarantee basic living subsidies , including pensions , the unemployment fund , and medical subsidies , for the object of social security and to meet the needs of the social security funding level ;  
Those who apply for judicial aid because they face financial harships or those who seek funds for basic living expenses should provide proof that the economic conditions of their own and their families are in conformity with the local government relevant departments ' stipulated standards for citizens ' economic difficulties .  
At present , we must make continued efforts to guarantee basic living expenses for staff and workers , who have been laid off by the state-owned enterprises , and must pay in full amount and on schedule both the old-age pension to retired personnel and the minimum living expenses to the urban residents .  We should more rapidly build or refine our social security system ; should build both an unemployment insurance system and an old-age insurance system for the staff and workers ;

Tibet 's culture has acquired new contents of the times and is advancing forward .  The criticism of " extinction of the Tibetan culture " essentially requires the Tibetan people of the present day to completely keep the way of living and the value of culture under the feudal serfdom in old Tibet .

China 's economic successes are universally acknowledged , and it has steadily improved the living standards of its people , increased its national strength and significantly boosted its international standing , he noted .  
The most fundamental experience in achieving tremendous successes in reform and opening up in the past 20 years and more is that at all time and under all circumstances , we have regarded whether or not what we are doing conforms with the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people as the highest standard in all our work , and have regarded meeting the growing needs of the material and cultural life of the people and improving the living standards of the people as the most important task .

The rational use and protection of nature , supporting world peace and promoting mutual development , and raising the standard of living in every country , especially the developing countries , will require even more talented engineers and technicians with creative spirits , and it will also require that the engineers and technicians of every country further strengthen their exchanges and cooperation .  
The practice in the construction of our country has also proved that if the productive forces develop slowly , it will be difficult to resolve various kinds of contradictions and problems exiting in economic and social life , and it will also be difficult to meet the people 's demands for improving their living standard .  
The session emphasized that in formulating the 10th Five-year Plan and smoothly achieving these goals , it is essential to regard development as the main topic , restructuring as the main line , reform , opening up , and progress in science and technology as the motive force , and improving living standards as the fundamental starting point .

This will be conducive not only to improving the peasants ' living standards and stabilizing the situation in the rural areas but also to exploiting rural markets and bringing about a sound interaction between industry and agriculture and between the urban and rural economies and a coordinated development of all of them .  
With the constant improvement in people 's material and cultural living standards , various social sectors have a growing demand for commemorative gold and silver coins .

The proposal adopted by the CPC Central Committee for formulating the 10th Five-Year Plan disclosed this important information : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , China will take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic starting point . 
Through the formulation and implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , China will be able to better adjust its own pace of development , release the initiative of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , concentrate all efforts on the theme of " development , " and advance toward the strategic objective of building a moderately developed socialist country and enhancing the people 's living standards so that they are able to lead a fairly comfortable life .  
Today , when the 10th Five-Year Plan is formulated , the framework of a socialist market economy has been initially set up , the concept of building a market economy has struck deep roots in the hearts of people , the living standards of our people have basically reached a moderately high level , the supply of most commodities has exceeded their demand , economic globalization has become a major trend , China 's accession to the WTO is just round corner , and international competition is becoming increasingly acute .  
The four other guiding principles are taking the structural readjustment as the main thread , making reform and opening up and scientific and technical progress as the motive power , improving the living standards of the general public as the starting point , and persisting in a coordinated economic and social development .  
In considering the strategic arrangements and important measures for the reform , opening up , and modernization , it is imperative to regard development as the theme , structural adjustment as the principal line , the reform and opening up and advancement in science and technology as the driving forces , and the improvement of the people 's living standard as the fundamental point of departure .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : To implement the strategy for the extensive development of the west country , it not only requires plain living and hard struggle on the part of the broad ranks of cadres and masses in the west country over a long period of time , but also calls for energetic support from the people of the whole nation , especially of the eastern regions .

certain headway has been attained in the undertakings of welfare , health care , culture , education , and sports for the elderly ; and both the living standards and the life quality of the old have been improved on a constant basis .

Active efforts should be made to study and explore new forms and new methods for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work among the elderly under the present new situation , and to carry out the ideological and political work among the elderly in a practical , flexible , thoroughgoing , and meticulous manner , so that the great majority of old people can enjoy a colorful , healthy , and civilized way of living in their remaining years .  
Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .

He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
It calls for acting in line with the requirements of the " three represents , " attaching prime importance to resolving relevant issues related to people 's immediate interests , including striving to increase the incomes of urban and rural residents , especially low-income people in the urban areas and the incomes of peasants .

According to actual conditions , we must understand and grasp the theme of accelerating development , actively make structural readjustment with the stress on development , do a good job in making institutional and scientific and technological innovations , two major driving forces , and eventually use these driving forces for improving the people 's living standards .  
I believe that in the course of implementing the Tenth Five-Year Plan and realizing the third strategic objective in the new century , minority areas can seize the opportunity afforded by the great development of the west to speed up economic development and social progress and raise the living standard of the minority nationalities so as to gradually bring about the common development and joint prosperity of all nationalities .

Southern Jiangsu and some areas along the Chang Jiang have started ahead of time to stride toward the third-step strategic goals .  
The second is that the means of management are different .  The reemployment service centers of enterprises are in charge of the workers of the state-owned-enterprises who are removed from their work place , including the issuance of basic living expenses and paying of social insurance fees on behalf of the workers ; whereas socialized management is applied to the unemployed personnel .  
We should fully implement various policies set by the party Central Committee and correctly handle relations between reform , development and stability .  We should place the task of increasing people 's standard of living in an important place , and consolidate and develop the good trend of economic growth .  We should promote a sustained , rapid and health development of the national economy and all-round social progress , and achieve a good beginning of the " 10th Five-Year Plan . "  
Deputy Raidi from the Tibet delegation noted : The reason why Tibet has attained such a rapid economic growth and social progress is that the people of all ethnic groups in the region are living together in unity and harmony , and this has given rise to a stable social environment .

Once the railway is built and operational , it will : further the economic and social development of Tibet and raise the people 's standard of living ; put Tibet in better economic and cultural contact with its brother provinces , autonomous regions and directly-administered municipalities ; bring the various ethnic groups closer together ;  
In the course of making great development in western areas and implementing the Tenth Five-Year Plan , it is necessary to further consolidate the unity of all ethnic groups , promote comprehensive social and economic development , and strive to enhance the living standards of the masses .  In the course of economic development , attention should be paid to bring local advantages into better play .  
Looking ahead , we have now finished drawing our blueprint : to double the 2000 GDP by 2010 , make more affluent the people living in moderate prosperity , and form a relatively complete and sound socialist market economic system ;  
What is different from the previous plans is that the 10th Five-Year Plan regards raising the living standard of the broad masses as a basic point of departure .  It embodies the alignment of national planning with the people 's livelihood and is a plan that fully reflects General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents . "  
We will not merely stay at the growth of per capita income but , more importantly , make efforts in numerous areas including the consumption structure , living environment , social security , public services , medical treatment and healthcare , spiritual demands , and so on so that the material , spiritual , and cultural demands of the vast number of people are satisfied as much as possible , and their quality in life is improved .  
Under the conditions of reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , party cadres must make greater effort to build up their party spirit , adopt a correct attitude toward power , position , interests , have the ability to resist the corrosive influence of various decadent ideas , and set a good example in working hard , living thriftily , and performing official duties honestly and uncorruptly .

To meet this objective , we may need to consider steering away from the past approach in which urban renewal had been conducted in a piecemeal manner .  Instead , we will plan urban renewal and rehabilitation more comprehensively for larger areas , with a view to more effectively restructuring and re-planning the old urban areas , re-designing a more effective and environmentally friendly transport and road network , replacing incompatible land uses , adding open space , and designing buildings which meet the demands of modern living .

"  
But over these eighty years , sweeping changes have taken place in our country , which we are all proud to see .  China has evolved from a country plagued by foreign invasion and domestic upheavals to a stable and peaceful nation exercising the rule of law , from a backward and isolated country to a nation that has opened up and become stronger through the promotion of science and technology , and from a poverty-stricken country to a nation with a rising standard of living .

However , for those secondary school students who live in the Islands District , which covers an extensive area , the time required for travelling to some secondary schools within their school net but distant from their places of residence is often longer than that required for travelling to schools in an adjacent school net .

China 's earliest royal dynasty - the Xia dynasty ( 2070-1600BC ) - first established its capital in the Henan region and during the subsequent 3,300 years more than 20 dynasties established their capitals in Henan Province . The large quantity of archaeological finds demonstrate that as early as 400,000 or 500,000 years ago humans were living in the Central Plains area and at some time between 7,000 and 9,000 years ago agricultural production had made its beginnings there during the period of Peiligang culture ( c . 7000X5000BC ) .  
Having carefully considered the request of the Staff Side of SCSC , the Chief Executive is of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that in determining the size of each year 's civil service pay adjustment , the Government takes into account the following factors : the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale .

The children not only regard her as " mother " but also look upon each other as brothers and sisters .  
At first , people were skeptical over his intentions , since with the improving living conditions in Taiwan , beggars and private garbage collectors were becoming part of history . But despite this problem , and the rheumatism and neurasthenia that afflicted him , he continued to work until he had won the support and understanding of the public , and even his health improved .  
Topics covered included improving the aborigines ' living standards , dredging waterways in Er Chung to prevent floods , strengthening communications with people at the basic level , and stabilizing prices of agricultural products .  
Because crabs need constant supervision , their culture is not an easy task . The supply of snails for their diet is also limited . But as standards of living have risen , and seafood restaurants have become more popular , crab farmers are assured of a handsome profit .  
Story of a Small Town Mountains covered with fir woods and bamboo groves , frequently shrouded by mists and sharply divided by the sparkling Chingshui River , provide an idyllic setting for Tsaoling Village in central Taiwan . Its pastoral people , who earn their living through a resourceful array of specialized products , help further to induce an atmosphere of rural peace .  
As a result , the Chinese lost a considerable part of one of their most priceless heritages . Today , however , as standards of living in the Republic of China have improved , the flow is being reversed . Many people in Taiwan are interested in collecting antiques , and have laid out large sums of money to bring these valuable ceramics " back home . "  
A New , Clean Deal for Taiwan Rapid industrialization in Taiwan has brought with it the inevitable bane of advanced countries everywhere - - pollution . Improved living standards associated with the economic advance have made matters worse by increasing the number of motor vehicles .  
About 300 years ago , the first migrations of Chinese to Taiwan began . The new arrivals struggled to make a living , but faced many unexpected natural calamities . Taiwan is on the earthquake belt , it is also afflicted by typhoons , and because its climate is tropical or subtropical , disease was more rampant .  
These will be surrounded by an agricultural zone which in turn is surrounded by a protected area where development is prohibited . Upon completion it is projected that the new city will have a population of 450,000 . It will be a total living environment where people can work , live and relax .  
They asked her to raise her left hand if she wanted to marry the rich and ugly son living to the east , and to raise her right hand if she wanted to marry the handsome , but poor son living to the west .  
They do n't just want to cover their bodies from the elements but also to express themselves in clothing . So as living standards increase , the textile industry is going to be more promising . The industry has a strong base , so long as the industry people are not convention-bound and they emphasize research and development leading to high quality products .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
While living in the United States , Chang discovered this stone , shaped like the island of Taiwan , and placed it in his garden in Los Angeles . Later , when he came to Taiwan , he had it shipped over especially for his garden . On the stone are carved the two characters " Plum Hill , " executed by the master 's own hand .  
Market trends in Europe and the U . S . this year show that older people are buying ceramic dolls to pass on to the younger generation . International demand for gift items , steadily increasing apace of world population growth and improved living standards , has led to the development of worldwide gift industries . Advanced nations often phase out their production of small gifts in favor of larger , technical and high profit items .  
The rapidly rising standard of living in the Republic of China has led to the increasing diversification of life for its citizens . As options increase , the average citizen becomes busier - - previous chores become more difficult to accomplish as a greater proportion of time is spent engaged in differing activities .  
Later , an incarnation of Chang Hsun came looking for an appropriate site for a temple and settled on Anhsifu . A local official inspected the area and felt that the cave there would produce phoenixes , an omen meaning that someone living in the area was destined to become famous . The phoenixes , therefore , must not be allowed to escape , and the official ordered that a stone pillar be placed on the " phoenix 's wing . "

In the first , murderers and brigands are tied to a bronze pole filled with fire . The second contains Blade Mountain . Here those who blasphemed the Buddha or wantonly killed living creatures are forced to climb naked up a mountain of innumerable sharp swords . Punished in the last level , the hell of freezing cold , are husband-killers , adulterers , the unfilial , and those who urged others to gamble .  
" Taiwan 's economic progress over the past thirty or more years has raised living and educational standards and increased the desire of the populace to participate in politics . This , together with other changing objective conditions , has made ' lifting martial law ' and ' opening up the formation of new political parties ' a natural decision , " says government spokesman Chang King-yuh .  
Maintaining trade secrets is vital to high-technology industries , and so the park enforces tight security . People entering and leaving are checked for identification , and the park forms something of an independent living space separated from Hsinchu proper , with its own residences , activity center , athletic field , swimming pool , library , school , and so forth .  
These observations coincide closely with records concerning saris in the Buddhist scriptures . " The article went on to explain that " the reasons for the formation of gallstones can be hereditary , or one 's natural physical constitution , while the majority stem from a lack of physical excercise , a build-up of bile in the gallbladder , or irregular eating habits . . . . The late Hsin Jung vanished into monastic life at the age of sixteen and spent 32 years living as a monk .  
It was a residential building with no sign in front , butno mistakethis was the Yang Ming Woodcarving Co . The scene inside was typical of a family workshop : a wooden ship displayed in a cabinet in the living room , carved wooden masks hanging from the walls , various kinds of wooden athletic equipment stacked in the corners . . . only not a trace of a sword in sight .  
Master Sheng-yen has two explanations for the turnabout . First , at a time when contemporary man 's living space grows ever smaller and social tensions ever greater , Buddhism offers people explanations for the flux around them and a limitless spiritual space to roam in . And second , as people rise in educational level , they gain a new understanding of Buddhism which they find more acceptable .  
Ho Te-hong , Chairman of the Forestry BureauThe Taiwan Forestry Bureau is like the eldest brother or sister in a family who earned money to support their younger brothers or sisters . And after their living standard improved , the younger brothers and sisters , now having grown up , turn around and reject their elder brother or sister , viewing them as good-for nothings or saying that their former jobs were not prestigious enough . When our nation was poor the Taiwan Forestry Bureau struggled to keep our heads above water .  
This has received attention because : ( a ) The proportion of the elderly in the population has increased ; they hope to continue to study and fill out their lives . ( b ) People demand satisfaction in their spiritual lives as the standard of living rises . ( c ) Constant technological change requires opportunities for continuing education .  
To use wooden fish to temper one 's mind has a very symbolic meaning . The never-sleeping eyes tell us that Buddhist cultivation is limitless and that the cleansing process is endless . The masters living in the tranquil temple purify their inner selves day and night . What about we who remain in the material world ?  
The attention of our people will gradually shift from the enjoyment of things and material well-being to the more refined and spiritual side of life , and people will stress quality rather than quantity . More emphasis will be put on enjoying life , on sampling quality products , on moving into the more rarefied atmosphere of high-class and well-designed living quarters , at the same time reaching into the top echelons of fashion - - all within the ethos of traditional Chinese culture .  
Because the legal requirement for twelve years of compulsory education has been set , the extremely tough competition for vacancies in a restricted number of pre-college institutions will gradually relax its stranglehold . This will give students and educators more leeway to pursue a balanced development of aesthetic skills and the capacity for aesthetic appreciation , coupled with the social graces needed for community living . Within colleges and universities , a well-rounded education will make up the deficiencies of an unbalanced curriculum and give due attention to the humanities .  
Science and the fruits of science will be harmoniously integrated with human life . The modernity and completeness of its public facilities will actively promote a well-rounded existence which is pluralistic in both inspiration and application . The result will not only enhance our international image , but it will also turn us into a model of what modern living should be like . .  
For European diplomats of his generation , fluency in fifteen languages and the experience of living in places like Batavia , the Hague , Tokyo , Chungking , Washington , New Delhi , Beirut , Damascus , and Kuala Lumpur would n't be considered extraordinary perhaps , but his illustrious " amateur careers " are downright astonishing . He was a musician , instructed in the Chinese lute as a young man by the master Yeh Shih-meng .  
At the same time , the government should also thoroughly implement ecological protection and prevention of public hazards , while improving traffic , public safety , and living environment conditions . In this way the people will not only have access to plentiful resources for their everyday life , but will also enjoy a rich and meaningful spiritual life , thus thoroughly realizing the ideals of prosperity and equitable distribution of wealth as prescribed in our Principle of the People 's Well-Being .  
These two legends , which are almost identical in content , tell of a pious woman ( actually Ksitigharbha in a previous existence ) whose earthly mother often killed living things and committed sinful deeds .  
With the influx of these high-level new immigrants , the image of Chinese Americans , who had been described as " smelling half of ginger and half of detergent " ( because many of them earned a living by running restaurants or laundries ) , changed completely overnight .  
Because the old Chinatowns , crowded and filthy , with their restaurants and souvenir shops , are located in the heart of city , Peter Kwong calls Chinese Americans living there " downtown Chinese " in distinction to " uptown Chinese , " who are professionals , drive nice cars and live in the suburbs .  
For many Taiwan businessmen , these conditions are lax and lenient , not to mention such advantageous factors as the countries ' spacious living environment , their rich natural resources , temperate climate and relative proximity to Taiwan . According to a survey by the Institute of Ethnology at Academia Sinica , Australia now stands even with the United States as the most alluring land of milk and honey for potential emigrants from Taiwan , and New Zealand ranks number five .  
With English as its official language , obviating the need to learn another foreign language , along with its relative proximity to Taiwan , its similarity in climate and its spacious and comfortable living environment , Australia makes for a highly competitive choice .  
While government breeding efforts have tended to concentrate on basic cereals such as rice and wheat , economic growth and rising living standards have brought increased consumer demand for high-profit horticultural products like flowers and fruit . Farmers now devote more growing area to these , new varieties are being introduced , and private-sector involvement in variety development is on the rise .  
We spoke frankly , I watched the meeting and the election , and I attended the dinner . The piece de resistance was the seminar I chaired . The discussion revolved around living in a foreign land , coming to terms with the new land and the old , where the future of China was headed and so forth . Everyone talked in full confidence , unable to stop , and the seminar did n't break up until one o'clock at night .  
Whether or not a program being planned to pass on traditional performing arts to the younger generation becomes a reality will depend on receiving a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development . It 's worth noting that Yang Hsiu-ching and Yang Tzai-hsiung , a husband-and-wife team that has won a National Heritage Award for their achievements in Taiwanese shuo-ch'ang ( a form of popular entertainment featuring singing and comic dialogue ) and is considered a town treasure , have moved back to Hsichih after living elsewhere for many years .  
Highly experienced editor Liao Chingsung , who has worked with all the new directing talent , remarks : " Society was just entering a better off phase , and with basic living requirements taken care of the audiences wanted to have more information . " The new directors were on the scene to present social and historical aspects hitherto ignored or considered taboo , at the same time as providing something for the new urban middle classes to spend their money on and talk about .  
Another unique national treasure in the Tatachia Area is the Formosan Salamander . These nocturnal amphibian tailed creatures are scattered in mountains above two thousand meters , living under damp , dark rocks or fallen trees .  
Yang Ming-chao says , " Our environment is getting worse day by day . The river water and soil are enduring heavy pollution . The standard of living is low , and we are cut off from the outside . Our public works are backward , and no one is willing to come and invest .  
Because the purpose of the garden is to display all kinds of plant life , and it has been operated for almost 100 years , the trees are tall and vigorous , the floor beneath the trees is damp and dark , and people are prohibited from walking in certain areas . Added to all this , there is a rippling pond . This is the equivalent to manufacturing an optimal environment for living things . "  
We reached a particularly steep stretch of the path and my legs grew weary . Only a few slanting rays of sunlight managed to pierce the broad canopies of the enormous trees scattered about both sides of the path - - the forest 's parasol . The world under this living umbrella was a moist and luxuriant green realm of nameless grasses and strange insects that flew up whenever one disturbed them . It was a timeless , carefree world under the care of the mountain .  
It would be nice if Chinese living overseas could share more of what they have learned with each other , especially French cuisine , which is world famous - - I expect that French cooking is more attractive than jus cheese and salads . As for oysters , judging from my many years of experience work ing in a hospital , it 's best to eat them cooked instead of raw .  
Shih Tsui-feng feels that , apart from the fortunate few who have their own homes , most modern urbanites are hard put to share their cramped living spaces with the traditional New Year 's couplets , but he says , " Still , even if it 's just a single character , such as ' Spring ' or ' good fortune ' - - hung upside down - - it 's always nice to hang something that adds a little holiday spirit and traditional flavor to the season .

Originally many of the Chinese in Singapore were illiterate and had inferiority complexes , which were aggravated by their living in an international port like Singapore where English was paramount . They broke their backs working so their children could study abroad .  
For me and many other overseas Chinese living here , Taipei is such a distant place that it 's hard to sense what it must be like , how it 's changed from quiet and tranquility to bustling crowds and prosperity . Life here is a matter of constantly doing our utmost to realize ourselves and raise our oppressed status . It 's just like that passage in " Chinese ?  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
The rapid development of technology has resulted in a gap between the living standards of the highly industrialized countries and the underdeveloped countries . As a result , the 1.2 billion people in the advanced industrial countries consume seven-eighths of the resources . And the four billion residents of the " Third World " are faced with hunger in many areas . This is also a topic that those involved in science and technology ought to consider .  
I 'm sure the reason many overseas students go bad or give up on themselves is that they 're afraid of being unable to live up to their parents ' expectations , combined with the stress of living overseas and the pressure of getting ahead academically .  
For example , the National Association for the Spinal Cord Injured of the Republic of China plans to spend three years to build a spinal injury refuge center , capable of accepting 1,000 people , in Hsinchu . The entire living and working environment is geared to the needs of the severely handicapped , so that they can find solace , and go on to receive occupational training and work in the refuge factory .  
Due to the binding of clan ties and the manpower required by farming , not only has it not been altered , but its original three-sided courtyard building has seen the addition of 13 auxiliary hu-lung ( protective dragon ) buildings at its sides , creating living space for a clan of some 200 families in two blocks .  
Besides the hardware and shape , traditional ho-yuan also extolled a natural , layered and shifting spacial notion . Could this be applied in a vital , living way to modern architecture ?  
The ancestral home , in use for four generations , was thus levelled overnight . For the older generation who are accustomed to living in the ho-yuan , there are psychological obstacles in making the leap into a tall building in a single bound .  
Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide . He argues that in the two hundred years since the industrial revolution , the large-scale use of non-recyclable materials by mankind has allowed modern people to enjoy the same standard of living as an ancient emperor attended by 200 servants .  
Only the application in daily life of ideals c allow even more people to participate , so that everyone will realize that environmental protection is n't so difficult . One need only make a few adjustments in one 's basic living habits to be able to change the environment . The basic view of green consumption is the admonition : " Do n't avoid doing something just because the gain seems small ; do n't go ahead and do something just because the harm seems marginal . "  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
But because those who have left find themselves in a strange environment and often adapt poorly , this creates even greater pressures . Forty-nine-year-old Chiu Chin-shih , who has spent half his life on the plain studying , living , and working , uses his own experience as an example : If an aborigine is competing with someone else for a job , unless one is extremely outstanding and the only one qualified , if it 's a situation where only one guy is going to get hired , they wo n't take the aborigine .  
I particularly enjoy its bilingual format as it helps me to better my knowledge of the written Chinese language . One of my favorite sections is " Overseas Reports . " I am a second-generation ethnic Chinese , born and bred in New Zealand . I have a keen interest in Chinese living in other parts of the world , and Sinorama gives a fascinating account of fellow Chinese in some very surprising countries .  
An irreplaceable part of modern living : CFCs have many advantages . They are non-toxic , odorless , cheap , stable , non-combustible , and non-corrosive . They are also easy to put to use , and do not leave polluting residues on the surface environment .  
During the warm period prior to the ice age , which is to say at the same time that the Han Chinese legend of Hou Yi ( who shot down nine of the ten suns with his bow and arrow ) was said to take place , the Taiya version has it that another sun appeared in the sky . There were two suns , one above and one below , so that the distinction between day and night was lost . The weather became oppressively hot , and illnesses spread rampantly ; all living things faced extinction .  
The faces of Buddhist Statues are mass produced in plastic ; the frames for final resting places are carved by machines and are ragged ; and course paper is used for the ceremonial spirit house , " says Master Hsu , angry about the superficiality of the living . As for whether the place where the deceased reside in the afterlife will leak water or collapse , that is of course part of the gap between this and the other world , and there is nothing anyone can do about it .  
Today , agricultural villages are in a period of transition . The elderly are not accustomed to living with their children in the crowded cities , and they 're unwilling to live in old folk 's homes . If old trees and the environments around them can be preserved , the villages can remain semi-agricultural , the elderly will have places to go , and their spiritual needs will be taken care of , too .  
The Taiwan Strait is no more than 100 meters deep at its deepest part ; if more silt is washed down from the mountains than is carried away by the sea , the surplus is deposited along the two coasts , and more is paid in than withdrawn . Thus the land spreads outwards in the same way that living cells ceaselessly grow and multiply . In this way , with the passing of the seasons , new land appeared from the sea , the western plain was formed , and the Lanyang Plain was born .  
Confined to modern living spaces , most domestically-raised hawks look more like homeless puppies , " sitting listlessly in a tiny room , with sparse and thin feathers , always nervous and alert and ready to strike , but finding themselves tied down and unable to fly . "  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
Chen Kuan-cheng explains that the typical European and American social security system is an intergenerational transfer of benefits , which is to say that the living expenses of the current elderly are paid by the current young and middle aged . When the current young become the seniors , the next generation will pay the bills .  
As far back as the time of the prehistoric matriarchal society , the primitive people living in the Yellow River valley had begun to keep dogs . Dogs were the first domestic animals to be reared by humans , and were not only intimately involved in people 's daily lives on a prac tical level , but were also an indispensable part of life on the spiritual plane .  
Painter Kuo Chen-chang used Western pop art techniques , with rough black lines and bright , beautiful colors , to tell the Chinese myth of Kua Fu , who died trying to reach the sun . His work is a metaphor for pitiable modern people in their endless quest to make a living .  
Except for a thin stretch of western Taiwan 's coastline settled by Chuanchow and Changchow Fukienese and a few Pingpu indigenous peoples , Shen was welcomed only by deep , forbidding mountains . The Han Chinese living on the coast called these " Fanshan , " or " savage mountains . "  
Taiwan 's history is not all centered on the Western plains . The aboriginal peoples have been living here for thousands of years . " He says that human activity in Taiwan has a vertical distribution from ancient to modern times and from high to low . Even the highest mountains show traces of human presence .  
At that time it was specially stipulated in the land reform law that the houses of overseas Chinese were acquired through their efforts abroad . Except for those houses that were rented out and definitely involved " exploitation " and which had to undergo " national reform , " the government could not confiscate those houses in which the families of overseas Chinese were living or those rented out which did not exceed 150 square meters .  
We saw old women who were living proof of the traditional model , mature women caught at the crossroads of tradition and contemporary society , and women who have crossed the historical divide and are actively creating their own space for the " new generation . "  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
In the films , Bruce Lee played such roles as a student in a martial arts training school in one of the foreign concessions in the early years of the Republic of China , or a lonely Chinese expatriate going to Southeast Asia or the West to try and make a living . Faced with inevitable bullying and insults from Westerners and Japanese , he would endure their repeated taunts , suppressing his anger until he could yield no further and all his pent-up ire would burst out .  
As international boundaries become increasingly blurred and the global village becomes a reality , working or living overseas no longer seems unusual . Yet families divided in this way have to confront the risk of dramatic upheaval or even disintegration .  
And you may make more money if you are lucky , or less money if you are not , but if spousal relations are not good , everything else is just meaningless . Structural problems must be solved conceptually : " I most dread hearing people say that they feel very proud of the fact that their wife lives in the United States and that their children go to school there . " Chien says that things will turn out well only if both parties realize that living apart is not a normal condition .  
But because not all fishes ' fins have the " honor " of being one of the " eight treasures , " no other fish can help sharks spread their risk . For sharks ' situation is just the opposite of other fish , whose flesh is dear but whose fins are cheap . In the past the market for shark meat was never well " developed , " and this led to the tragedy of sharks having the fins cut from their living bodies and being thrown back into the sea .  
The imposing Presidential Palace 's forbidden places are no longer unapproachable . The Presidential Palace does not combine working space and living quarters as do the White House or Buckingham Palace , which can reveal markedly different styles of interior design through the deliberate arrangement of chambers and gardens by the successive occupants . Nevertheless , for the average citizen , the Presidential Palace holds its own unique charisma .  
" Thus someone living in Harbin would be So-and-so Harbin , " he says by way of illustration . The Ching emperor Chien Lung ( 1736-1796 ) decided that the surname-less Jurchen consequently fell into rampant incestuous marriages . Only after a long period did fixed clan names evolve . The names of the eight Manchurian tribes were first recorded and explained in the Complete Record of the Family Names of the Eight Banners , so it was only from this time forward that the Jurchen had a relatively well-ordered system of family names .  
It is true that the brook masu salmon have survived from ancient times , and they are internationally famous as Taiwan 's precious living fossils . But still , in the greater context of the incessant deterioration of Nature , these fish are not the only creatures who ultimately are finding it difficult to escape extinction . And at the same time , how much hope remains as the salmon struggle against the manmade " New Nature " ?  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
In order to accommodate the living habits of the village 's Saisiyat residents , Wu thought of incorporating the short spirit ceremony into the dance , and with that in mind in 1994 he specially attended the biannual ceremony at Sky Lake , where he taped the entire thing . He also spent time off from work to visit with Saisiyat elders and the parents of the students in order to get a firm grip on the meaning behind the ceremony .  
For instance , some people like to take fish spears underwater to catch fish . This not only results in a reduction of that species , but also affects the local food chain , or it forces fish schools to swim farther out to sea . Try to avoid disturbing the ecology . Also , many divers trample on soft coral or move pieces of stony coral , so that the algae and other organisms living on them die .  
But today , when there is a greater emphasis on morality and humane treatment of other living beings , many countries are hard at work creating animal protection laws in the hope that in addition to wild animals , the pets with whom people have ever closer relationships , livestock and other animals that serve economic functions can also have legal protection . Humans will never stop eating and using animals , but some of the pain and hardship can be eliminated from how they use them . Such laws could also prevent unnecessary abuse .  
Today , the urban environment imposes restrictions on dogs , which need space to move . The chance of dogs living a vagrant existence increases greatly in big cities , where garbage piles up but is not easily cleared away , enhancing the chance for abandoned dogs ' survival . This is one of the reasons why impoverished nations have similar amounts of stray dogs as advanced nations .  
However , from the 17th century onwards , wave after wave of immigrants flooded onto this peaceful , happy land through the harbor at Tainan , encroaching on the Sirayas ' living space . Those Siraya who did not retreat further and further south or into the mountains accepted the rule of the incoming political authority and were subsequently assimilated .  
It was a terrible feeling , a sense that you had taken all the insults you could take , yet having to scratch out a living in the dirt . It was anguishing , pretending to be deaf and ignorant and compromising yourself due to the overall situation . " He adds , " There was no place to vent your sorrow . Sometimes you just had to hold in your tears and pretend to be cheering . "  
The hospital was on the ground floor , with the family 's living quarters above . On the landing , Peng 's mother would put pails of disinfectant and water , with which the children would have to wash themselves before being allowed upstairs . At a time of limited understanding of sanitary principles , when many Taiwanese children were malnourished , how Peng 's childhood differed from the vast majority of Taiwanese !  
But after many years of development , densely populated Hong Kong has a shortage of living space , and the developed area of the colony has steadily expanded . It has been impossible for Rennie 's Mill to avoid being drawn into these changes . And things get even more complicated when you consider what the coming of 1997 means , given the town 's political orientation .  
The furo bathroom , with which she is most satisfied , is separate from the main living area , and connects with the storeroom . It does not have an ordinary bathtub , but is dominated by a big traditional wooden tub , which keeps the water warm longer . There is also space for the big kitchen stove and the wood it burns .  
But later his father suffered a stroke , and the family faced a difficult financial situation . The burden of supporting the household fell entirely on Chou Meng-te 's shoulders , and he had no choice but to leave his undemanding teaching job with its regular salary and find another way to earn a living .  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election . ( His guess exceeded the theoretical limit of 260,000 because he also considered the number of ROC citizens in the US who still have legal residence in Taiwan , and thus are not included in the estimate of 260,000 eligible " overseas Chinese . "  
In recent years , wild animals raised in captivity have been given more living space and more natural surroundings . Still , says Marcus Phipps of TRAFFIC , there are still some extremist animal rights groups overseas who wish to close all zoos and sea-world theme parks , with the goal of returning the animals to their natural habitats .  
In fact the requirements are very broad : people over the age of 65 living on their own - - no matter whether they are weak , lonely , poor or just plain bored - - are all qualified .  
Based on his previous research work and on the finds at the ongoing test dig , Liu Yi-chang can offer a general description of the first Puli-ites - - " Tamalin Man " - - living 2400-1700 years ago . They were a late neolithic people who used flaked stone tools . From the large number of hitching stones and animal jawbones it can be inferred that they knew fishing and agriculture .  
Because chelonians are n't picky about their living conditions , with the exception of a few species such as the Indian star tortoise which has strict temperature requirements and often dies a year or two after being brought into captivity , most species of turtles resemble mutant ninja turtles and adapt quite well to sewers , which are designed to carry away urban pollutants . Turtles are tough .  
Furthermore , in the past Chinese would rarely consider questions from an anthropological perspective . Over the 5000 years of Chinese culture , what was regarded above all else , what was viewed as most magnificent , bold and righteous , was in fact far removed from a normal person 's way of living and values . After the May Fourth Movement , people reflected a lot on these problems .  
The country grew rich , and in 1938 the Labour government introduced the world 's most comprehensive social welfare system . New Zealanders , born with a silver spoon in their mouths , not only had their education , living expenses and health care paid for completely by the state , even their mothers looking after them could collect money from the government .  
Americans are condemned as ignoramuses living in a country that somehow manages to be both immature and degenerate . Japan is dismissed as a naive child with a fat body and a small brain under American occupation . The British are unfortunately represented by a debauched Oxford graduate whose main occupation seems to be standing up women in Thailand and mainland China .  
But it was not only deep in the mountains that one could see the spirit of thatched-cottage living among ancient literati . Even in the busy urban centers , some high officials , tired of extravagance and luxury , embellished their personal gardens with rustic thatched structures .  
When rain falls from the heavens groundwater is naturally replenished , and for thousands of years Chinese farmers have sung : " We work from sunrise / We rest at sunset / We dig wells for water / What do we care about the might of emperors ? " The ceaseless supply of groundwater bubbling up from wells enabled people to drink when they were thirsty and wash when they were dusty , and allowed agricultural society to ignore the power of emperors and self-confidently affirm that people 's value came from living on the land .  
It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture . " It has more meaning from the perspective of cultural preservation and education . "  
" At that time , we were only students , but living deep in the mountains , life was so hard for the Ssumakussu people . They brought out the best of all they had for us , and looking at their honest and simple faces , while we were very moved , we also felt ashamed and uneasy , " says Ma . " Who were they ?  
At museums , on the street , at sidewalk stands , in temples , at the vanguard of urban design , and in the shifting light and shadows of the city , looking for the value of existence , I 'm oppressed by a nightmare that piles up over my head as thick as clouds , blocking the road ahead . Masses of people coming , masses of people going , and I 'm just living on here in this empty , preposterous world of corruption and waste .  
Since appearing in Taiwan last Novem-ber , the book A Great Revolution in the Brain World has hit the spot with modern people living with " diseases of civilization . " It uses a mix of accessible language and medical evidence to propose an approach to health and longevity . This book became especially hot after NHK did a TV documentary series based on it . Bookstores sold out their copies in a week .  
In the end , Lin has selected and weighed the most absolutely central , canonical materials from history , taking into consideration every kind of musical genre and aspect of living concern , as in the typical emotions in human social life , praise of nature , the careful observation of transformations in space and time , various interesting features of everyday living , the fundamental pulse of life , and so forth , and in this way has gradually expanded the collection to 67 musical pieces .  
I believe that the problems that a family living in our crowded urban society must face in regards to the quality of living environment , educating children and economic pressures have already made us weary and incapable of patience when we must face situations within our families or in the outside world . What is more , jagged wounds have been left behind in our spirits and our bodies .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
He has created his own " iron net " tsun technique ( a painting technique utilizing cracking to represent irregular surfaces ) , which remains true to ink painting 's basic principles of contrast between black and white ; however , the sheer strength of his contrasts , the starkness of his strokes and their motley cracking , all suggest the alienation and disorder of post-modern living .  
Architecture scholar Wang Chen-hwa says that there are three kinds of historic building restoration : The first is untouched preservation , leaving a building how it is without touching a thing . Secondly , when a building has urban historical significance , there is restored preservation . Thirdly , if the building is still connected to people 's lives and is usable , a preservation method that involves active utilization of the building can be adopted . " Historic buildings are living and changing all the time , " he says .  
For the Rukai , living at the foot of the mountains , land belonged to the tribal chief , who was responsible for looking after the old and weak . But hunting land rights were determined by general agreement . Hunters did not necessarily leave their hunting grounds to their own children , and any child with an instinct for hunting could go into the mountains to learn from an elder huntsman .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
Looking from another angle , after the Communist Party of China had won power , if they had governed well , developed China , fulfilled the calls to " overtake the US and Britain , " and improved the living conditions of the people , then even if Zhang had acted traitorously , even though his actions were morally flawed , the result of these actions would have been that China became rich and strong and he would still be a national hero to be revered through the ages . However , this has not been the reality .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
Every two years , Dr . Lai Chiu-nan , originator of the " total natural health " lifestyle , based on a " living foods " diet , comes to Taiwan to promote her method for maintaining a healthy body , mind and spirit . Her talks always draw thousands of people . In March of this year , she came to Taiwan again to hold a workshop , leading 600 people in physical and mental training in the mountains of Shuanghsi in Taipei County .  
He avers that married couples have been through a long process of falling in love , marriage , and living together , which provides a foundation of emotional attachment and understanding . When divorce becomes inevitable , the two people have already been through repeated internal struggles .  
Shunza , who was born in Beijing , grew up in the US and studied music in Switzerland , sings of the desire to return home after years of wandering , sentiments which have won her a following in the ranks of students living away from home . She has also touched upon lust , an area that female Taiwanese singers rarely do , with the lyrics " I just ca n't get enough of you . " She also sings that the world is so boring that even the toys protest .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
During the Sino-Japanese war of 1895 , the northern fleet was completely destroyed . By the time of the collective foreign invasion during the Boxer Rebellion , there was complete psychological collapse among the Chinese masses , and the Qing government finally realized the seriousness of the problem of having a population living in ignorance .  
Tsai Yuan-pei had been living in France when he received a telegram from the Ministry of Education , hoping to entice him to come back to take the reins at Beida : " The nation is returning to normal , and urgently in need of education . Now we are making your virtuous self master of the capital 's highest academic institution . "  
Everyone makes their own special contributions . By combining our resources , our lives and activities have become much more varied , " Wang says . To publish the newsletter , professional botanists living in the community provide information about plants , those who studied art provide the graphics , and those who work for magazines write and edit the copy . The result is an impressive newsletter that is a major resource for keeping people informed and for building a sense of cohesion within the community .  
Six children had been severely burned during an experiment in a " talent " class when , through carelessness , the alcohol ignited causing an explosion and fire . A Mr . and Mrs . Wang Tsung-yuan , who had returned to Taiwan after living abroad in Canada , realized that their badly burned nine-year-old son would need psychological care in addition to physical treatment . They immediately asked the hospital to arrange it for them and encouraged the parents of the other children to talk to psychologists as well .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
The most novel interpretation of the tales of love between immortals and regular human beings appears in a book published in Taiwan , in which the author argues that the denizens of heaven are sapped of their sex drive by perpetually fair weather , beautiful clothing , delectable food , and centuries of living at a metabolic rate of zero .  
" He has melded cultural affirmation and ethnic self-respect with literary practice to create a purely Chinese literary form , " says Ng Kim Chew . " This provides solace to his personal sensibilities , both literary and ethnic . " There are few who can compare to ECM writers living in Taiwan in terms of how hard they work , either . Li Yung-ping was once an assistant professor in the department of foreign languages and literatures at National Sun Yat-sen University .  
The reason dZi beads have been connected to living Buddhas in Taiwan is that many believers take them to Buddhist masters to be " invested with spiritual power . " When Namgyal must tell people that what they supposed was a valuable old dZi bead is just a well-crafted reproduction , even he cushions the blow by saying that they can always ask a master to invest it with spiritual power so that it will become just as effective as a true old dZi bead .  
Of course , " The road to the Land of the Dead is traveled by old and young alike , " so the elderly and seriously ill are n't the only ones who need to make a will . People in their primes , living hectic , busy lives and under great pressure at work , should also be prepared for death at any moment .  
But with something as marvelously complex as the human body , there are always eventualities that can not be predicted in a living will . For instance , when a patient falls into a deep coma as a result of a stroke , the brain stem that controls cardiopulmonary functions may become completely unresponsive ( resulting in brain death ) . In such circumstances , a patient could die in a few minutes or might survive for two weeks , but death is assured .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
" The fact that aboriginal cultures are ' living cultures ' allows the Sheng Ye Museum to adopt an unusual style of exhibition , " explains Hsu Kung-ming , associate research fellow at the National Museum of Natural Science . " Unlike many other museums which must rely on displays of historical artifacts , the Sheng Ye Museum pays equal attention to collecting reproductions of antique styles , modern works of aboriginal art , and exhibiting displays created by contemporary craftsmen .  
Mr . Tseng , who makes his living from manufacturing metal parts for pet products , lives with his wife in Hsinchu , where they are both deeply involved in local charity work . They founded the Tong Hsin Volunteer Service Association , whose efforts are focused on services for the elderly and on recycling . They are also both counselors in the Hsinchu Family Education Service Center . Their colleagues consider them a perfect couple .  
Their owners are not only required to provide them with sufficient food and drinking water and a safe living environment with adequate shelter , air and light , but must also prevent them suffering unnecessary disturbance , abuse or injury . Animals must not be subjected to fear or pain when being transported , and they may only be slaughtered by humane methods which cause the least possible suffering .  
" With this behavioral outlet , people do n't consider the more important question of improvement . " Yeh says that the stray dogs " set free " onto Taiwan 's streets are symptomatic of people 's ingrained reluctance to face up to the real suffering of living things .  
The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times . The area has been a major center of civilization in China , and was the birthplace of renowned patriot-poet Qu Yuan and the statesman Zhuge Liang , among many others . Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
This 2,000-year-old sleeping beauty has " preserved her good looks " by being sealed in a plaster cast over 100 centimeters thick and using over 5,000 kilos of charcoal to dehumidify her tomb . When she was unearthed , archeologists found her wrapped in 18 layers of silk . Her hair was still black , some of her skin still retained a hint of suppleness , and her joints could still bend . Unlike the mummies of Egypt , the marquise seemed almost like a living person after centuries in the tomb .  
" Chelungpu is a classic reverse fault . The east side of the fault was thrust diagonally upwards , and more or less everyone living along that side was killed or injured . But although the west side was subjected to the same violent shaking , most of the buildings remained standing . "  
When Tiway Sayion retired from his position as principal of Hualien 's Tafalong Primary School after a teaching career that spanned 45 years , his first act was to realize a long-cherished dream-he returned to the tribal community where he was born and built a cabin in which to live . Tiway Sayion 's simple 20-ping cabin is laid out with the kitchen and bathroom on the right and the bedroom on the left .

With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences . In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .

But social work postgraduate student Chen Chin-jung , who is writing her master 's dissertation about foreign brides , maintains that its more an exchange than a purchase . In her view both the Taiwanese bridegrooms and their foreign brides are seeking in the other an opportunity to fulfill a need of their own . The men want the opportunity to marry and start a family , while the women are seizing a chance to improve their standard of living and to better themselves . This makes each of them the best choice in the other 's eyes .

Before the 1980s , academic work on aborigines was largely confined to anthropology . Research focused on things like the clothing , social structure , and myths and legends of the various tribes .

For fifty years people in Taiwan have worked their fingers to the bone to improve living standards and have neglected the beautiful mountains and rivers lying at their feet .

Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control .

Before the 1960s , one third of Taiwan families were classified as " patriarchal families . " These were " extended families " consisting of both direct and co-lateral family members living together . After the 1980s the proportion of " blended families " ( a " stem " family composed of three directly related generations ) increased .

Unexpected was the fact that children very much hoped to live with their elderly parents and conform to the traditional model of filial piety in this regard , while the image they had for themselves in old age was rather untraditional .

Intending to prevent a recurrence of Bunun resistance and because it was difficult to keep the garrison roads in good repair in the deep mountain areas , the Japanese government went a step further and forced a mass displacement of the Bunun down the mountain to the lower reaches of the Lakulaku River on the Huatung Valley plain . Through contact with the Han Chinese and the Amis people living there , the unique characteristics of Bunun mountain culture were gradually lost .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
Thrilling as stories of epic heroism may be , there is a subject even more worth pondering : How is it that the combative and courageous Bunun are so respectful and gentle in dealing with the other living things that share their mountain surroundings ?

The thrifty gene theory hypothesizes that because of harsh living conditions in Asian countries during ancient times , individuals with a genetic endowment that enabled them to more efficiently store fat as a hedge against times when food was scarce were more likely to survive the natural selection process to reproduce .

Adjustment programmes are designed to promote both macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform , and thereby to lay the foundations for high quality growth - a prerequisite for a sustainable and equitable improvement in living standards .  
The budgetary burden will increase in the short and medium terms in connection with the extension of economic and social infrastructures to the rural areas and the unserviced urban periphery and inner-city slums where the poor are living .

Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .

In circumstances in which the Belgrade Government is widely recognized as the champion of double standards , and the situation of Albanians living on their own lands in Kosovo is increasingly grave and alarming as a result of the Serbs ' repressive and truly genocidal activities , the entire content of the Serbian memorandum is simply ridiculous . 
Although they said that the main focus of UNICEF should continue to be in rural areas , several delegations stressed the need for UNICEF to emphasize poor populations living in such environmentally vulnerable areas as slums and marginal urban pockets .  
In particular , better understanding is beginning to emerge of linkages between the supply process on the one hand ( population , education , health ) , and the diverse and dynamic activity of fluctuating demand for human resources ( in public and private sector employing establishments , as well as self-employment and a growing variety of less formal ways of making a living ) on the other .  
In paragraph 12 ( g ) , making economic growth and the interaction of market forces more conducive to social development requires " ensuring substantial public and private investment in human resource development and in capacity-building in health and education , as well as in empowerment and participation , especially for people living in poverty or suffering from social exclusion " .  
The Heads of State and Government were conscious of the fact that the prime objective of their efforts must be aimed at improving the standard of living of their people and , in particular , at effectively combating the critical state of poverty in which a large part of them exist , and that they must commit themselves to promote the sustainable development of the region , as a viable strategy aimed at improving these conditions .  
Conscious of the fact that the prime objective of our efforts must be aimed at improving the standard of living of our people and , in particular , at effectively combating the critical state of poverty in which a large part of them exist , we commit ourselves to promote the sustainable development of our region as a viable strategy aimed at improving these conditions ;  
These internally displaced persons have suffered the hardships typical of other refugees and internally displaced persons : they were forced to flee their homes and established community structures at very short notice , unaware of where they were going or how they would end up and having to endure temporary shelter and extremely poor living conditions .  
If differences among countries ' living standards are the focus of the comparison , then a purchasing-power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate is regarded as the most appropriate method , as it values the commodities and services sold in each country at a set of common international prices , rather than at local prices multiplied by the value of the national currency determined in the foreign exchange market .  
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ;  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .  
According to the calculations made by advocates of this policy , it would cause such a serious deterioration in the standards of living of the population that spontaneous public demonstrations of popular discontent would occur , bringing to an end the social revolutionary process begun 36 years ago , and thereby fulfilling the main objective of the foreign policy towards Cuba of the last nine United States administrations .  
NULLConstituting more than half of the population living in absolute poverty , women would thus represent the majority of the beneficiaries targeted by any properly designed micro-entrepreneur and SME development programmes - except where their participation in production and economic activity is constrained by social factors or by special limitations on their access to capital .  
National Governments of all countries are encouraged to undertake a systematic assessment of the extent to which current international , regional and national warning systems adequately address their own requirements to provide ready access to warnings for all citizens , and particularly those living in local communities most exposed to hazards .  
The Special Rapporteur has not received any communication from the Government regarding the questions raised in his previous reports and at the same time the Government did not put forward any explanation or substantial denial in relation to the most serious abuses and violations , namely those committed against children living or working in the street and the camps set up for children belonging to these categories .  
The Special Rapporteur believes that the racial dimension of the violations and abuses against children living in northern Sudan , or , in the case of children in southern Sudan , those who are abducted and sold into slavery constitutes a particularly grave and alarming circumstance , which should be of particular concern from a human rights perspective .  
NULLAs far as the situation in southern Sudan is concerned , hundreds of thousands of children continue to live in insecurity in the conflict zones , in danger of being abducted , exposed to lasting psychological trauma , or living in inappropriate conditions .  
Problems are , among others , the lack of safe and sanitary living environments , malnutrition , the risk of infectious , parasitic and water-borne diseases , the growing consumption of tobacco , alcohol and drugs , unwarranted risk-taking and destructive activity , resulting in unintentional injuries .  
Technical and financial cooperation is still needed from the international community , however , failing which there is little likelihood of consolidation of economic growth , reconstruction , improved living conditions for the poorest sectors of the population , peace , democracy and the functioning of democratic institutions .  
Another institution with a direct bearing on the process of reconstruction and improving the living conditions of poor groups is the Social Investment Fund , which channels assistance to poor sectors of the population , including those uprooted by the conflict , thereby meeting the dual objective of combating poverty and strengthening the process of national reconstruction and reconciliation .  
Despite all the efforts of the international community , particularly the Paris Club and development partners such as France , Germany , Japan , the United States of America , Denmark and Canada , to alleviate the debt burden and cancel part of the bilateral official debt , the least developed countries continued to experience a falling standard of living .  
They were confident that their standard of living was improving , that their poor would soon be employed , that their children would become better educated , and that they would be taken seriously as economic actors on the world stage .  
In addition , the phenomenon of the caste system , which could be characterized as multiple apartheid , also must be addressed openly with a view to mitigating the suffering of millions of people living a life of bondage and discrimination which divided them into upper and lower echelons , segregated them and excluded them from the political , economic , social and cultural spheres of society . 
While the term " living resources " in the Convention might be broad enough to include free living and symbiotic micro-organisms , the collection and subsequent use of microbial genetic resources is not necessarily analogous to traditional methods of harvesting marine living resources .  
In the situation when the levels of earnings and the standard of living are very low , when even the basic needs for food , accommodation and clothing are difficult to meet , it is more and more difficult for the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to devote attention to environmental quality and protection .  
Problems are , among others , the lack of safe and sanitary living environments , malnutrition , the risk of infectious , parasitic and water-borne diseases , the growing consumption of tobacco , alcohol and drugs , unwarranted risk-taking and destructive activity , resulting in unintentional injuries .  
The economic crisis faced by LDCs has further undermined health conditions in many countries as living standards have fallen , health services have been cut owing to budgetary pressures , and the availability of imported medicines and other medical supplies has dwindled .  
Regarding preparations at the national level , the Committee took note of the substantial progress achieved since the first substantive session , and further strengthened the best practices initiative on improving the living environment by further refining the criteria for nomination and the format for reporting on best practices .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 and 49 / 9 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
It was pleased to note that , with the assistance and support of the international community and through the committed efforts of the Palestinian population , the Palestinian Authority had gradually established its administration and had taken a number of measures to ensure public order and to normalize Palestinian political , social , economic and cultural life , as well as to improve living conditions .  
The gradual economic reform which the transition to a market economy required was having adverse repercussions on the population 's standard of living and particularly on the most vulnerable sectors such as the disabled , elderly persons and young people .  
The living quarters allowance is intended to reimburse United States government civilian employees for costs for a temporary residence or housing whenever Government-owned or rented housing is not provided ( including rent , heat , light , fuel , gas , electricity , water and taxes , insurance and agent 's fees required by law or custom to be paid by the lessee ) .  
In the case of the United States government employee assigned or posted to a foreign area , the base pay is augmented by living quarters allowance , post allowance , post differential , danger pay , and other allowances , as applicable .  
The report on international cooperation for the eradication of poverty in developing countries ( A / 50 / 396 ) was valuable overall and responded generally to resolution 48 / 184 of 21 December 1993 ; however it lacked details on specific actions undertaken by United Nations bodies with respect to the role and needs of women living in poverty or the actions taken to improve social services in deprived urban areas .  
recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
With regard to the programme of activities for the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , ILO had adopted the only international legal instrument addressing the question of the living and working conditions of indigenous and tribal peoples , the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989 , which recognized that such peoples had a unique cultural identity , and stressed the need to involve them in the making of decisions that would affect their future .

The eradication of poverty requires that a sustained , collective commitment and effort be mounted by Governments , local administrations , civil society , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and also requires that anti-poverty strategies and programmes be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
macroeconomic factors which lay beyond the control of the countries of the southern hemisphere , where the vast majority of refugee populations were to be found , had impoverished those countries even further , leading to massive outflows of people seeking better living conditions .  
The purpose of the process is to create an administration that can carry forward the implementation of democratic social and economic reforms ; an administration capable of utilizing all past experiences and of consistently and dynamically creating conditions for the well-balanced development of the country ; and , finally , an administration that will ensure that the burden of reforms is evenly distributed , that will care about improving the living standards of Polish families , and that will work to ensure that citizens can live in peace , free from the fear of crime and economic abuse .  
In the context of globalization and integration in which our countries are evolving , Governments are bound to assume a much more active role in helping to create efficient and competitive environments in our economies , thus enabling us to improve the standards of living of our peoples and contributing to the resolute head-on fight against corruption and impunity at the national and international levels . 
The International Tribunal set up to identify agents of genocide living abroad has not been effective , as it has been crippled by organizational , financial and operational obstacles .  
They also include improving public health , with emphasis on prevention and service for the most vulnerable groups especially children including planning , organizing and financing local health services ; improving basic public education , with emphasis on reducing illiteracy and on vocational training , with community participation , improved educational infrastructure , the promotion of culture and so on ; and the improvement of living conditions , physical planning and local infrastructure  
We should also remember that durable peace and sustainable development on a global scale can not be achieved unless all countries secure adequate living standards for their populations and overcome unemployment , poverty , social disintegration and environmental pollution .  
In the past four years the economy recorded an average growth rate of 8.2 per cent , resulting in increased employment opportunities and significantly rising living standards in the country , primarily in urban areas , where private enterprises are flourishing , and in fertile rural areas , where farmers have better incentive to grow and market their produce .  
To complete its programme of building a State based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all citizens of Benin would enjoy a certain minimum standard of living , the Government of Benin wishes to benefit further from the support and assistance of the entire international community .  
This has been done to achieve balance and stability in the economy as a whole and to activate the role of the private sector on the basis of a market economy and free competition , while taking into account the importance of improving basic essential social services , building a modern State and improving the standard of living of citizens .  
The Government , in partnership with other sectors of society , is playing a multiple role in improving living and working conditions on an equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoy adequate shelter , affordable basic services and sustainable human settlements .  
We are living in a world in which events are occurring that would have been unimaginable just a short while ago , major political changes in international relations that prompt us to rethink international law .  
Globalization is a positive force for the future of the entire world : unprecedented development in investment and trade , the opening up of the most populous regions of the world to international trade ; and the possibility for more developing countries to improve their populations ' living standards .  
Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
Likewise , we are deeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of Africa and other developing countries , as well as by the heavy burden involved in debt servicing , which is one of the causes of the continuous economic and social deterioration of our standard of living .  
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
Furthermore , and still within the same context of prevention , the countries whose institutions and infrastructures have been devastated by long-standing domestic warfare now need increased assistance from the international community to help them rebuild their economies and improve the living conditions of their peoples , because without ongoing economic and social development , internal tensions will always continue to threaten the stability of these countries .  
I should also like to reiterate the proposal made by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , President of the Republic of Tunisia , advocating the concept of a global economic and social plan aimed at guaranteeing African growth on sound and lasting bases and at assisting our continent to remedy its deficiencies , achieve integration into the world economy and ensure dignified living conditions for all peoples in Africa .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
Given the progress made to date , we can not forget that we must move towards prohibiting and completely eliminating this kind of weapon , because of its mass , indiscriminate and devastating effects , its long-term threat , its tragic human consequences and its widespread hindrance of the productive use of broad areas , particularly affecting those most in need and seriously jeopardizing the living conditions of many peoples .  
Peace is built through ordinary coexistence , with all Guatemalans , male or female , striving daily to make a living and to help their families get ahead , seeking out better opportunities while enduring hardships in a country with so many limitations and so much distrust . 
We view with appreciation and hope the fact that this interaction between Guatemala 's experience and the respectful participation of Governments and multilateral institutions is yielding modest but valid solutions , enabling us to envisage a simple , competent and less bureaucratic form of institutional structures , and a kind of cooperation that does not undermine the precarious living conditions of the poor majorities in our countries and that contributes ideas and technical skills with due respect for our population .  
Stresses that Governments , in partnership with civil society and all other development actors , including non-governmental organizations and people living in poverty and their organizations should cooperate to meet the basic human needs of all - inter alia , income , resources , education , health care , nutrition , shelter , sanitation and safe water - in particular of people living in poverty and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups ;  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
Although the Security Council meets far away from the scene of the events we are discussing today , and although we are not subject to the difficulties faced by the people in the field , I believe it is important that the personnel of the United Nations civilian and military should be aware of our solidarity with them and understanding of the difficult tasks and living conditions that they have to face .  
As industrialization proceeds in the dynamic developing economies and middle-income developing countries , rising standards of living and rapid urbanization will contribute to strong growth in electricity demand and petroleum consumption will rise from an increase in private motor transport .  
The host countries may request the Secretariat of the United Nations , within existing resources , to disseminate information which would be helpful to the diplomatic community in resolving the debt problems , including , inter alia , provisions of relevant international legal instruments and United Nations documents as well as information provided by the host countries on cost of living at a location concerned and relevant provisions of national legislation ;  
Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
Also recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
With regard to Tibet , her delegation noted that it had formed an integral part of China since the thirteenth century and that the Tibetan people had assumed control of their country in 1959 , the year in which China had abolished serfdom and introduced democratic reforms in Tibet . In the past 30 years , the country 's economy had developed and the standard of living had risen .  
That gesture had a double symbolism , as it expressed the traditional friendship between the Cyprus and Palestinian peoples and constituted a concrete manifestation of the progress in the peace process and of the need for substantial steps to improve the standard of living of the Palestinian people .  
Recalling that the Committee had requested a summary of the report presented by Ukraine at the Fourth World Conference on Women and had asked for further details of the commitments which Ukraine had made in Beijing , she said that the Ukrainian report to the Conference had described the overall deterioration of the situation of women , the decline in the standard of living , and the worsening demographic situation resulting from economic problems and the impact of the Chernobyl disaster , which continued to consume significant budgetary resources .  
The basic reasons for the rising divorce rate were the overall situation of political and economic instability , low incomes , difficult living conditions and environmental problems , and inadequate nutrition for children .  
Hiding behind a " living shield " of members of the Government forces , they are continuing attacks which are compelling the command of the armed forces of the Republic of Tajikistan to abandon the positions occupied by it in order to avoid unjustified losses of life among military personnel and the civilian population .  
Provision of adequate social services and facilities , improving and rationalizing urban planning and shelter design to cope firmly with the actual needs of communities , as well as provision of technical and other relevant assistance to the inhabitants of unplanned settlements are essential for the improvement of living conditions .  
In many cases , the unrestricted use of technology , the growing demand for goods and services from the ocean , uncontrolled population growth and continuous migration to coastal areas have led to the depletion of living resources and the degradation of the coastal and marine environment as well as of the economic conditions of some of the major sectors exploiting the ocean .  
A number of other actions can be noted , such as the 1993-1994 ban on the dumping of radioactive waste , sewage sludge and industrial waste and on incineration of toxic wastes at sea , as agreed in the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter ( London Convention ) ; ( c ) In relation to programme areas C and D , the legal framework for sustainable use and conservation of living aquatic resources in the oceans has been substantially improved since UNCED .  
Protection of the atmosphere , in regard to : ( i ) absorption of greenhouse gases ; ( ii ) climate change and its potentially drastic effects on marine living resources ; ( iii ) energy optimization programmes and reduction of dangerous substances in exhaust gas emissions ; and ( iv ) reduction in the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) in at-sea and coastal ocean industries ; ( g ) Chapter 10 .  
We recognize that access to safe and healthy shelter and basic services is essential to a person 's physical , psychological , social and economic well-being and should be a fundamental part of our urgent actions for the more than 1-billion people without decent living conditions .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
The living and working conditions in all human settlements , including regional urban centres , rural service centres , rural hamlets , rural communities , market towns and villages , must be improved , with particular emphasis on shelter , social and physical infrastructure , and services .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
Provide equal access to basic education , while paying special attention to the poor and to youth living in rural areas , and addressing constraints created by distance , lack of educational facilities and social or economic barriers ;  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
The economic crisis faced by LDCs has further undermined health conditions in many countries as living standards have fallen , health services have been cut owing to budgetary pressures , and the availability of imported medicines and other medical supplies has dwindled .  
It will be difficult for those who must daily face a lack of the basic necessities of life to commit themselves to a democratic system unless it brings about a genuine improvement in their low standard of living .  
In view of the harsh economic situation , the United Nations Special Coordinator in the occupied territories stated that the standard of living of Palestinians living under the autonomous region of Gaza had declined by 50 per cent since the signing of the Interim Agreement . 8 / A special appeal was launched to the donor community to support the Palestinian authorities in this crucial period . 
Bearing in mind that the increasing number of women living in poverty in developing countries , especially in the rural areas and urban slums , requires the urgent action of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures at the national and regional levels towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , [ 2 ] / adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women ,  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
( e bis ) Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ; ( g ) Reduce excessive military expenditures and investments for arms production and acquisition , as is appropriate and consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development ;  
The emphasis on artisanal mining is consistent with the objectives of the main international development funding organizations , such as the World Bank objective , stated at the round table , to alleviate poverty and improve living standards through sustainable growth and investment in people , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) objectives of poverty alleviation , environmental protection , job creation and promotion of the advancement of women .  
An action programme can then be prepared , based on the survey results , with a view to : ( a ) establishing enabling conditions for artisanal mining , ( b ) alleviating technical and financial constraints , and ( c ) improving the environmental , living and working conditions of miners .  
Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .  
It should be possible to quadruple the goods and services that could be produced with a given quantity of natural resources and energy , which would enable developing countries to quadruple their production and consumption without increasing their environmental impact , while the developed countries could maintain their standard of living while greatly reducing their environmental impact .  
The Working Group also stressed the need for increased support for training and capacity-building in the field of integrated management of coastal areas , and stressed the need for taking action to protect all critical habitats of marine living resources in the coastal zone , including coral reefs , mangroves , mudflats and estuaries .  
At the same time , we wish to stress our belief that a complete and absolute solution to the problem of extremism and terrorism is linked to bringing an end to the unfair and unjust practices against our people , to the achievement of further political progress in the peace process and to improvements in the living conditions and the difficult economic situation of our people .  
Document good practices , innovative models and success stories with respect to assisting women in improving their living and working environment , to the adoption of sound environmental technologies and to women 's role in maintaining sustainable urban environments under conditions of globalization and rapid urbanization , and propose ways of assisting them in that role ( UNIFEM , UNEP / UNCHS , World Bank , UNDP , UNESCO , DPCSD ) .  
" Micro-organisms " : bacteria , viruses , mycoplasmas , rickettsiae or fungi , whether natural , enhanced or modified , either in the form of " isolated live cultures " , including in dormant form or in dried preparations , or as material , including living material , which has been deliberately inoculated or contaminated with such cultures .  
The policies announced by the Government included a halt to the printing of money , a reduction in the excessive amounts of money in circulation , increases in the charges on government-provided goods and services , the sale of some government assets , and a relaxation of the restrictions on foreign exchange trading by allowing official exchange houses to trade at rates comparable with those available on the parallel market , as well as by allowing Iraqis living abroad to transfer funds to their relatives in Iraq .  
The number of individuals living in water-stressed countries or countries with a chronic water scarcity will increase tenfold in only one generation to encompass more than one third of the world population .  In waste areas , there has been an overexploitation of aquifers , which are becoming ever more seriously depleted .  The risks that threaten to erupt wherever socio-economic development depends on a continuously undermined key resource are evident : ultimate resource constraints will one day send shocks through such vulnerable societies .  
The Committee concluded that global demand was likely to increase for the foreseeable future , mainly as a result of the continuing increase in global population through most of the next century , and of the demand for improved living standards in developing countries .  
Promoting cooperation among government agencies , health-care workers , non-governmental organizations , women 's organizations and other institutions of civil society in order to develop a comprehensive national strategy for improving reproductive health care and child health-care services and ensuring that people living in poverty have full access to those services , including , inter alia , education and services on family planning , safe motherhood and prenatal and postnatal care , and the benefits of breast-feeding , consistent with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development ;  
We are referring to the desire of the peoples and States of the Commonwealth to make more effective use of their material and intellectual potential with a view to stimulating their economies , raising their standard of living and ensuring sustainable democratic development .  
Our deliberations on the two major themes of the Conference - adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world - have been inspired by the Charter of the United Nations and are aimed at reaffirming existing and forging new partnerships for action at the international , national and local levels to improve our living environment .  
To this end , we commit ourselves to improving the living conditions in human settlements in ways that are consonant with local needs and realities , and we acknowledge the need to address the global , economic , social and environmental trends to ensure the creation of better living environments for all people . 
As stated in the aide-m \ x { 5e66 } oire transmitted to the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Buenos Aires on 27 February 1996 , the Argentine Republic reiterates that the only rules applicable to the utilization of Antarctic marine living resources in the area adjacent to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are those laid down in the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and such rules adopted by the Commission established under the Convention as are currently in force .  
Noticing that the 14-million eligible voters among the 21.3-million Republic of China citizens living in Taiwan , Penghu ( Pescadores ) , Kinmen ( Quemoy ) and Matsu area have , through universal , equal and direct suffrage and secret balloting , elected their first popularly elected president on 23 March 1996 as their genuine representative in the international community ,  
Benefits are payable for 28 weeks to the mother ; in the case of women having given birth to two or more children and caring for at least two , as well as of women not married , widowed , divorced or solitary for other serious reasons and not living in common-law marriage , the payment of benefits is extended to 37 weeks .  
Although the total investment reached $ 95 billion in 1990 , it still fell short of the 25 per cent rate , which is normally the minimum level assumed to ensure Africa 's economic growth and a steady growth of the standard of living per capita .  
This degree of importance becomes even more obvious as one realizes that water is a natural resource which is scarce and limited and whose quality has repercussions in the ecosystems of which it is the core , thus capable of harming the living conditions of both present and future generations .  
The problem is that normally people living in areas with high potential biodiversity values are poorer and have less or no paying capacity compared with people in industrialized countries , where the value of biodiversity is often recognized , for example , as raw material for the pharmaceutical industry , or in terms of recreation for visitors . 
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
The programme is designed to improve urban living conditions and strengthen municipal institutional capacities for the planning and operation of urban facilities and public services , including water supply and solid waste management .  
On 1 August 1996 , notwithstanding the repeated complaints by the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations and the many requests made to the authorities of the host country by citizens living in the vicinity of the Mission and by organizations representing various groups within American society to remove these provocative and offensive signs , the sign located on the north-east corner , inside the security area of the Permanent Mission of Cuba , was not taken down but simply moved to the north-west corner of the same intersection .  
Some 15,750 persons living in the Jamahiriya are suffering from serious medical conditions ( cardiovascular disease ; fractures of the spinal column and thorax ; fractured skulls ; chronic eye diseases ; detached retinas ; serious burns ; cancer and malignant tumours ) which require emergency treatment ( neurosurgery ; spinal marrow transplants ; kidney transplants ; corneal transplants ; fitting of prostheses ) .  
The only viable long-term solution to the twin issues of unemployment and poverty lies in the building up of competitive productive capacities that can generate production and incomes among the population at large , a process in which industry is not the sole contributor .  However , all historical evidence suggest that industry plays a pivotal role in advancing technology , increasing productivity , nurturing entrepreneurship and generating a broad range of critical skills , all of which converge to increase a country 's standard of living .  
In their aspirations to raise standards of living , the developing countries are following the example of the already industrialized countries , and by seeking to build up efficient industrial capacities have chosen the only viable route to achieve lasting economic growth and escape the vicious circle of poverty .  
It is patently clear - and accepted throughout the developing world - that functioning markets and private initiative are among the most efficient and powerful mechanisms to generate wealth and thus permit increased standards of living .  
We reiterate that a comprehensive strategy in the fight against drugs must include the social and economic aspects of the phenomenon , to which end efforts must be directed towards alternative social and regional development programmes designed to help improve the living conditions of the rural families affected .  
In its resolution 47 / 180 of 22 December 1992 , the General Assembly , concerned that people 's living environments were deteriorating and in urgent need of concerted international attention , decided to convene the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in 1996 and to establish a preparatory committee for the Conference , and requested the Secretary-General to establish an ad hoc secretariat for the Conference .  
The Committee wishes to remind the international community that these tragic developments follow repeated warnings about the devastating consequences for Palestinian hopes and living conditions , of the delayed implementation by Israel of the agreements already reached , its prolonged closure of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the resumption of land confiscation and settlement , and actions against Palestinian property and institutions in Jerusalem .  
To secure a reasonable standard of living for the farming community especially through raising personal income for people employed in agriculture ;  
Contributing to this improvement were the slight deceleration of inflation ( as of July 1996 , 17.6 per cent on an annual basis ) ; increase in available foreign exchange owing to a growing number of visitors , both Haitians living abroad and foreigners ; and strengthening of the gourde resulting from the inflow of foreign currency by bilateral or multilateral donors to finance public investments .  
In my view , the presence and assistance of the international community will continue to be required beyond November 1996 to help the Government of Haiti set up a professional , well - managed and well-equipped civilian police and ensure that a stable environment will be consolidated , that democracy will take root and that economic and social development will translate into a visible improvement of the living conditions of the people . 
Viet Nam stands ready to cooperate with all countries for the effective implementation of the Treaty , contributing to a cleaner global environment and living conditions , enhancement of confidence and strengthening of international security , aimed at a more secure and healthy world .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
One of the most important reforms has been the creation of the National Solidarity Fund , into which voluntary contributions by citizens and enterprises are channelled , and the purpose of which is to implement programmes to provide remote regions and areas with a standard of living allowing the inhabitants access to basic communal facilities such as decent housing , health and educational infrastructures , roads , electricity and drinking water .  
The programme is intended for poor people living in rural , urban and peri-urban areas and has the advantage of combining various components designed to mitigate the chief manifestations of poverty : underemployment and unemployment , lack of skills , and precarious living and environmental conditions . 
Following the visits of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to a number of the country 's rural and urban areas , during which he noted the inhabitants ' difficult living conditions , the Select Ministerial Council decided to establish a national programme to remedy the situation in districts lacking basic infrastructures . 
It must be pointed out here that children and adolescents are targeted by this education-for-health programme as recipients and agents who can pass on the benefits , and health topics are increasingly incorporated in primary and secondary curricula as well as in cultural activities in schools and universities ( hygiene , nutrition , accident prevention , living with domestic animals , prevention of transmissible diseases , contraception , sexually transmitted diseases , AIDS . . . ) . 
They reaffirmed that the Convention and the agreements represented significant achievements of the international community through multilateral efforts in creating a legal order for the seas and the oceans that will , inter alia , facilitate international communications , promote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans , the equitable and efficient utilization of their resources , the conservation of their living resources and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
In addition , a special State programme had been drawn up to address the cultural , spiritual , educational and socio-economic problems of the 12-million ethnic Ukrainians living abroad .  
That being said , it was obvious that there were still dramatic variations between regions , and the question was whether the current relatively robust growth in the developing countries as a whole would translate itself into a widespread improvement of living conditions and especially into poverty reduction worldwide . 
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill-treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as the girl child , children of single-parent families and those born out of wedlock , children in rural areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who , in order to survive , are living and / or working in the streets .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee recommends that special protective measures be implemented in relation to children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single-parent families , children born out of wedlock , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , children involved with the juvenile justice system , particularly when deprived of their liberty , children involved in child labour and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , children living in poverty and children who , in order to survive , are living and / or working in the streets .  
The topic touches not only on the protection and preservation of the marine environment , including that of the international seabed area , but also on such other matters as the application of the consent regime for marine scientific research , the regime for protected areas in the exclusive economic zone , the duties of conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas , and the sustainable development of living marine resources generally .  
SBSTTA has recommended that this expert group should concentrate on determining the following areas where the Biodiversity Convention can have the greatest effect : integrated marine and coastal area management , marine and coastal protected areas , sustainable use of coastal and marine living resources , mariculture and alien species . 193 Other items of particular note discussed by SBSTTA included the economic valuation of biological diversity and its components , in particular in relation to access to genetic resources ( art . 15 of the Convention ) .  
Besides being of great scientific importance for studies of active geological processes in deep ocean basins , including plate tectonics , as well as climate studies , the map has proved of commercial value : already , fishermen use it to locate seamounts that produce upwellings of deep , nutrient-rich water that in turn supports abundant living resources ; industries use it to find the kinds of rocks that overlay oilfields and the kinds of volcanic eruptions that form undersea deposits of copper , iron , silver and gold .  
In Kazakstan , for example , emigration was sparked by social and economic reasons stemming from the decline in production during the period of transition , inadequate social reforms , and the decline in the standard of living , as well as by ethnic and cultural factors and environmental problems .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements worldwide , 2 .  Endorses the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements [ 3 ] / and the Habitat Agenda [ 4 ] / adopted by the Conference on 14 June 1996 ;  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
New , often very complex tasks in insecure living / working environments , especially for staff employed by humanitarian agencies , and mobility in both function and location are the main features of the current work of the international civil service .  
His Government reiterated its commitment to work with the United Nations in matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security in the hope that some day all the Organization 's human and financial resources could be devoted to encouraging social development and improving the living conditions of people everywhere .  
The Government and Brazilian society were resolved to work together to ensure full enjoyment of civil , economic , social and cultural rights , as well as political freedom , which was essential to improve the standard of living of the population .  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
The measures adopted to recognize and ensure the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the childs physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development ;  
The relevant indicators used to assess such an adequate standard of living , and its incidence among the child population , including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , social and ethnic origin , and family situation ;  
All the measures taken , in accordance with national conditions and within the State party 's means , to assist parents and others responsible for the child to implement this right , including the nature of the assistance made available , its budget implications , its relation to the cost of living and its impact on the population ; where relevant , the information provided should be disaggregated , inter alia by region , rural / urban area , age , gender and social and ethnic origin ;  
The right to development was thus essential to the peoples of developing countries , who needed higher incomes , improved social , health and education services and a chance to escape from extreme poverty and enjoy better living conditions if they were to be able to make a constructive contribution to the development of democratic systems that would guarantee full respect for their human rights .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General [ 1 ] on the implementation of resolution 50 / 10 ;  
Intensive humanitarian assistance was required from the international community to improve the living conditions and relieve their suffering until a just and comprehensive solution was reached in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) of 11 December 1948 .  Lebanon considered that the presence of Palestine refugees in its territory was temporary and was a consequence of Israeli occupation and the continuation of the Middle East crisis .  
I am sure it is obvious to all persons living in the south that the economic , social and political isolation imposed upon us has been counter-productive as this treatment has helped us to get stronger on our feet and to find adequate alternatives for self-existence , all of which help to consolidate and give permanence to the division of the island .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements , 
Recommends that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty and to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty and the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
In fact , the much needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , who continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .

The draft resolution before us on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing , unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction and fisheries by-catch and discards draws attention to a number of damaging practices that continue to threaten a sustainable future for the world 's living marine resources .  
They combine reckless exploitation of living resources in these zones with the dumping of hazardous material and other equally repugnant activities contrary to international law and civilized conduct .  
At the national level my country has pursued for some years a solid , viable , scientifically based programme to ensure the sustainability of tuna fishing and to guarantee the preservation of all living marine resources .  
The 1982 Convention , although the most universal and extensive instrument on the law of the sea , nevertheless can not fully reflect the growing concern of coastal States at the state of living marine resources , which often fall victim to uncontrolled and scientifically unsound harvesting on the high seas .  
Finally , a rising incidence of occasional or " weekend prostitution " by young housewives or students wanting to improve their standard of living by prostituting themselves on weekends or for a limited period of time , as a direct result of the economic crisis and unemployment , is becoming apparent .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting public-private partnerships , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
These are to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and the building of ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
Revisions were made to improve data quality in the following items : ( i ) data on " children ever born " and " children living " should be collected by sex ; ( ii ) " date of birth of the last child born alive " was introduced to replace " live births within the 12 months preceding the census " to measure current fertility ; and ( iii ) " deaths in the 12 months preceding the census " was added to measure current mortality .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
The Commission also considered the report of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 17 ) , submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 1996 / 12 , concerning the problems related to the right to enjoy an adequate standard of living ; foreign debt , economic adjustment policies and their effects on the full enjoyment of human rights and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
To transform the Gambia into a financial centre , a tourist paradise , a trading export-oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation , thriving on free market policies and a vibrant private sector , sustained by a well-educated , trained , skilled , healthy , self-reliant and enterprising population , and guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent standard of living for one and all , under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry .  
In fact , the much-needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people also remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , which still continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they had designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .  
And for peace to be truly meaningful it must also be translated into concrete improvements in the living conditions of the long-suffering Palestinian people ; hence , there is an urgent need for economic , financial and technical assistance by the international community .

Although missions to Mars are widely publicized and assurances are given that the world economy is growing , the distressing truth remains that today in the world a-billion people are illiterate ; as many are unemployed or underemployed ; and more than 2-billion are living under subhuman conditions .  
Preferential access regimes represented , rather , a real and sincere effort to enable small developing countries to produce for the international marketplace , to offer their societies a chance at a decent standard of living and to assure them a special stake in the global economy .

The basic principles governing these programmes were to respect and preserve , through bicultural education , the ethnic identity of each of the seven Mayan language groups , guaranteeing their legal stay and security in Mexico , until such time as they individually expressed their preference for voluntary repatriation , and to offer them a standard of living and opportunities for development and work equivalent to those of the Mexican population living in the same area .  
The challenge today remains the same : to meet an enormous projected global demand for resources , especially energy , through the use of new products , technologies and consumption patterns which will provide rising standards of living for all while minimizing economic costs and risks to human health and the environment .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .

In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is the most susceptible to being forced to move : in these grey zones ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to ground searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food , which lead the people to move temporarily or permanently .  
Despite abject poverty in the slums surrounding the cities , living conditions are still considered preferable to those in rural areas , particularly with regard to access to water and the availability of basic services , such as health and education , as well as access to markets , which provides opportunities in the private sector .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , to enable the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development . 
Many NGOs have demonstrated an ability not only to serve segments of the community that are difficult to reach , such as adolescents or women living in poor communities , but also to provide high quality services , to work in inaccessible or sensitive areas and to test innovative approaches .  
Reaffirms that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty , to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty , and to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Another school of thought , while recognizing the responsibility of the State to protect those living in its territory , held that the international community should also hold private individuals who perpetrated violence accountable , under the Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions , especially Protocol II , and that ethical and legal position had been gaining ground . 
The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
Therefore , the medium-term plan focused on the continuing need to improve the living conditions of all people , especially the poor and disadvantaged population groups , in both rural and urban settlements , with special attention given to the development needs of the least developed countries and of countries with economies in transition .  
In the resolution concerning the question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and study of special problems which the developing countries faced in their efforts to achieve those human rights , the Commission called upon States to secure , through national development policies and international cooperation , full respect for economic , social and cultural rights , giving priority to individuals , most often women , living in extreme poverty .  
In the light of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned about the persistence of discriminatory attitudes against some groups of children , especially girls and children with disabilities as well as children living in rural areas , which often results in limited access to basic social facilities such as health and education .  
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill _ treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as refugee and internally displaced children , children of single _ parent families , children in rural and remote areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who are living and / or working on the street .  
Particular attention should be paid to protecting the rights of children deprived of their liberty , especially those living in corrective labour institutions , to the establishment of an appropriate and independent monitoring mechanism , and to the improvement of the quality and adequacy of alternative measures to imprisonment .  
The Presidents stressed the need for unconditional respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the preservation and development , in accordance with universally recognized norms , of the ethnic , linguistic , cultural and religious diversity of all peoples living in the Russian Federation and Ukraine .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
Since countries differed in terms of their living conditions , level of development , geographic characteristics and cultural traditions , there could be no uniform standard or model for solving the problems related to human settlements .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
It can not be overemphasized that discrimination between human beings on the grounds of race , colour or ethnic origin is an obstacle to friendly and peaceful relations among nations and is capable of disturbing peace and security among peoples as well as the harmony of people living side by side even within the same State .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
In its resolution 51 / 202 , the Assembly stressed the importance of encouraging national initiatives for social development , including , inter alia , credit for people living in poverty , particularly women , along the model of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in connection with self-employment and income generation to address the feminization of poverty , and noted with interest the micro credit summit to be held in Washington , D.C . , in February 1997 .  
The Government has also set in motion the Social Solidarity Network , a strategy that aims at improving the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of the population and initiating large social programmes through joint efforts of State-owned and territorial institutions , non-governmental organizations and the civil society .  
The Sub _ Commission recognizes the efforts of the Government of Guatemala and urges it to continue with its policy of implementing measures for the protection and promotion of both individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to continue to take practical measures against poverty and to eradicate extreme poverty in order to raise the living standards of the population ; and to redouble the efforts already instituted to overcome the marginalization and discrimination to which the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have been , and continue to be subjected .  
Disturbed that millions of women worldwide suffer from extremely poor housing and living conditions , including severe pollution , overcrowding , polluted water and inadequate sanitation , all of which give rise to serious mental and physical health problems and cause thousands of women to die , or to live in a permanent state of ill _ health ,  
Requests Governments , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations and the specialized agencies , actively to support local , national and international initiatives , including the development of human rights indicators , aimed at assessing and improving the housing and living conditions of women throughout the world , in full consultation with and with the full participation of women themselves , their representatives and community _ based non _ governmental organizations and other relevant groups ;  
The States of the Rio Group had reaffirmed that an integrated strategy to combat drugs should take into account the social and economic aspects of the phenomenon ; it was thus essential to implement social and regional development and substitution programmes designed to improve the living conditions of the rural families concerned . 
The closure had had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the occupied territories with at least 10 per cent of the population living below the poverty line and the losses resulting from the current closure estimated at more than US $ 6 million a day , which was more than the financial assistance provided by foreign donors .  
Despite the political and economic development achieved at the regional and international levels , the establishment of economic groupings and the expansion of free trade , there had been an increase in poverty , diseases and illiteracy resulting in a deterioration in the standards of living of developing countries .  Moreover , economic barriers continued to be erected against developing countries .  
After years of living under centrally planned regimes where the private sector hardly existed as in the countries of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union most fledgling entrepreneurs lacked financial and business experience and the facilities were not available for them to start operating .  
In the face of the intransigent position of the military junta , which has refused to step down , bringing about further deterioration of the situation in the country , which has one of the world 's lowest living standards , and threatening regional peace and security , the Polish delegation believes that the measures recommended by ECOWAS , which the Security Council would take by adopting the present draft resolution , are appropriate for the objective of the expeditious restoration of the democratically elected Government of Sierra Leone .  
Those suffering the most are the civilian population of the occupied territories , whose standard of living has been eroded steadily as a result of the very serious economic and social situation .  
Although no reliable data exist on the prevalence of drug abuse in Afghanistan , anecdotal evidence suggests that it has increased during recent years , which may be explained as a consequence of the hard living conditions caused by a prolonged war , combined with the increasing availability of both opium and heroin .  
Similarly , the promise to provide a decent living to all has been threatened by the negative effects of globalization and the inadequate attention given to economic , social and cultural rights .  
The stories are heartbreaking doctors and nurses forced to live in the lobby of a closed hospital ; middle-class families who owned their own homes , sent their children to college , travelled abroad , now living by selling their possessions .  
The seminar should not forget people living in rural and outlying regions ; access to the Internet must be given to everyone everywhere , all rights _ economic , social and cultural , not only civil and political _ must be respected .  
In his view , the words within its territory could not be interpreted as granting State parties unfettered discretionary power to carry out wilful and deliberate attacks against the freedom and personal integrity of their citizens living abroad .

In my delegation ' s view , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a fundamental means of ensuring the peaceful and sustainable use and development of the oceans and their resources , through , in particular , the promotion of international cooperation , the equitable and efficient utilization and preservation of living marine resources , and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .  
Yet all these efforts have been frustrated by hostile and aggressive actions taken by the occupying Power , which , far from showing itself ready to negotiate , has continued its policy of illegal settlements and violation of international law and human rights of the Arab people who live the bitter reality of living under occupation .  
Notwithstanding historical and cultural traditions , by which elderly people have always been greatly respected , the improvement of their standard of living requires ongoing political efforts to mobilize and utilize available resources in the context of families , communities , civil organizations and the private sector .  
The population policy thus aims at improving standards of living and quality of life ; improving health and welfare through information and education ; further reducing fertility and mortality rates ; encouraging Kenyans to adhere to small family size ; promoting family stability while recognizing the rights of women and children ; and eliminating social and cultural practices that have a negative impact on women and girls .  
Although the number of people in Malta living below the acceptable national standard of living is about 1 per cent of the population , the Government continues to give special importance to social services and , within the constraints of a small island economy , social welfare programmes now provide an adequate safety net even for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged .  
What we all have in common is the wish and the request of peoples to have a better standard of living than they had in the past , real sustainable development and sustained growth in their countries and for their human rights and freedoms to be fully protected and observed .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
The Commission urges support , upon the request of the State concerned , for national efforts to gain greater access to resource information and to develop appropriate policies to facilitate the exploration and exploitation , with the States consent and in a manner consistent with the sustainability of marine living resources , of non-living marine resources within its exclusive economic zones , or to the outer limits of the continental shelf , wherever applicable .  
Stresses the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , including the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
Developing countries priorities are to eradicate poverty , with international support for achieving poverty reduction targets as agreed in United Nations conferences and summits , and improve standards of living , including meeting basic needs and lessening the burden of external debt , while taking all possible steps to avoid environmental damage and social inequity , for the furtherance of sustainable development .  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
The Committee is fully aware of the human and material costs of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka and the deleterious effects this has on the economic , social and cultural rights of every person living in the country .

In industrialized and developing countries , young people are living at a time when profound economic , political , social , cultural and environmental changes are occurring , resulting in both opportunities and constraints .  
In the context of its contribution to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , ILO was currently developing an urban employment programme focused on more and better jobs in the informal sector aimed , among other things , at improving the living and working environment in poor urban neighbourhoods and increasing the capacity of national and municipal governments to create jobs in cities ; it would also promote the adoption of innovative approaches to urban job creation .  
In implementation of high royal instructions placing rural areas at the heart of governmental strategy , in the framework of the policy enabling all citizens to participate in cultural life and to contribute to the improvement of rural living conditions , and with a view to improving the geographical distribution of cultural services and facilities , the Ministry of Culture has initiated , in cooperation with local communities , an extensive programme to build and equip libraries in rural centres .  
Since the beginning of 1998 , the Serbian military and police forces had launched a military attack against the Albanian population which had left thousands of innocent victims , including pregnant women , children and elderly people.They had deliberately shelled Albanian villages , destroying one third of the houses and forcing more than 300 , 000 people to flee , and had brought about a catastrophic humanitarian situation , with people living in the open without shelter , food or medical assistance .  
Guideline 5 encourages States to enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws to protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors ; ensure privacy and confidentiality ; ensure ethics in research involving human subjects ; and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies when the laws are breached .

The reportedly typical public building accommodation visited by the Representative provides cramped living space , with extended families occupying single rooms originally designed to house one student attending higher education or technical institutes .  
While return is now a possibility for some , the vast majority remain in a sort of economic , legal and social limbo between the eventual goal of return and the need , in the interim , for a decent and dignified way of living .  
Enhancing the capability of small island developing States to ( i ) assess and monitor fish catch and the processing and marketing of fish by foreign and domestic fishing companies ; ( ii ) develop a legal framework for sustainable fisheries activities ; and ( iii ) develop management plans and policies for assessing , monitoring and exploiting both the living and non-living resources in the EEZ ;  
The International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which is binding on Bosnia and Herzegovina , contains some of the most significant international legal provisions establishing economic , social and cultural rights , including rights relating to work in just and favourable conditions , to social protection , to an adequate standard of living , to the highest attainable standards of health , to education and to enjoyment of benefits of cultural freedom .  
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is generally forced to move : in these " grey zones " ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food to force the people to move , temporarily or permanently .  
Apartheid was introduced in 1948 by the National Party as a system of racial segregation designed to maintain a situation of inequality between the Whites and the other ethnic and racial groups living in South Africa , in the economic , social , political and cultural spheres .

The poverty trap in which the poorest of the poor find themselves shows how human rights are indivisible and interdependent : the right to an adequate standard of living , to housing , to education , to work , to good health , to employment , to the protection of the family , to respect for privacy , to legal status and registration as a citizen , to life and physical integrity , to justice and participation in political , social and cultural life .  
The contribution of those living in extreme poverty could be of decisive importance in current thinking on sustainable human development and the right to development , especially since the concept of development is no longer viewed only from an economic standpoint , but also in social and cultural terms .  
The present section summarizes , by region and by sea , the main priorities and challenges , developments in decision-making , and activities at the national level to promote integrated coastal zone management , marine environment protection , and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources .  
Among the main concerns in the region are unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of those natural resources on which rural communities depend ; optimized use of land ; living conditions of coastal people ; insufficiently treated urban wastes , oil pollution and coastal erosion .  
The major interests at the international level are the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources and pollution by dumping of waste , protection of the sensitive environment of the Arctic Ocean , and exchange of scientific information on the oceans and its living resources .  
It is no longer acceptable or even practical to divide the international community into two distinct groupings : one living behind the walls of fortresses of alliances and weapons of mass destruction , while the security concerns of others are completely neglected as they are depicted as the source of possible threat and worthy of containment and deprivation . 
Promote , through educational and other programmes , efforts aimed at better informing the population about the urgent problems of environmental protection , rational nature management and improving the living environment for current and future generations.For the Republic of Kazakhstan : 
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
To secure , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
Her Government was committed to fighting poverty , inter alia by promoting the education and health of girls , enhancing their participation in the management of natural resources , improving their living conditions , combating violence against women , increasing their participation in decision-making and improving synergy among the relevant mechanisms for advancing the status of women .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Concerned also that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
In developing countries , such corruption may undermine economic development through a number of related factors : the misuse or waste of international aid ; unfinished development projects ; discovery and replacement of corrupt politicians , leading to political instability ; and living standards remaining below the countrys potential .  
The fact that the number of people worldwide living in abject poverty has increased is a clear signal of the imbalances and bias in the current global financial and trading system .  
We are of the view that illegal , unregulated , unreported fishing activities have a severe adverse impact on the effectiveness of measures for the sustainable management and exploitation of marine living resources .  
First , we have set an ambitious objective of cutting in half the percentage of people living in extreme poverty , stressing the necessary links between social and macroeconomic policies .  
We need societies where every single individual regardless of social status , gender , disability or ethnic or religious background is empowered to influence his or her living conditions for a better future .  
Among other things , world leaders committed themselves to creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that would enable people to achieve a better standard of living .  
Promoting community development , improving access to security of land tenure , housing and basic services , and fully integrating people living in poverty into economic , social and political life , which are crucial to sustainable development ;  
It would be possible for Equatorial Guinea to ensure , within a reasonably short period , the full realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights for the 450,000 inhabitants living in its territory of 28,000 square kilometres .  
At an international level , coordinated taxation of international capital flows and support for universal human rights to minimal standards of living would also contribute to improving income distribution .  
Recognizing the need for the realization of a standard of living adequate for the childs physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development , as well as the provision of universal and equal access to primary education ,  
On the other hand , mountainous countries and regions are populated by numerous ethnic groups and peoples whose traditional socioeconomic lifestyle enables them to adapt to and organize their vital activities in harsh living conditions .  
However , his Government was confident that with the support of civil society and the assistance of the United Nations specialized agencies , its efforts would lead to sustainable human development and improve the basic standard of living of its population .  
A major part of the worlds population still faced intolerable living conditions , which were further aggravated by the rapid pace of urbanization , increased poverty and the negative effects of globalization .  
During the initial phase , given the limited resources available , a range of measures is planned to halt the decline in the standard of living and the level of social protection of the population .  
The measures adopted to recognize and ensure the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the childs physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development ;  
The relevant indicators used to assess such an adequate standard of living , and its incidence among the child population , including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , social and ethnic origin , and family situation ;  
In Ecuador , a team of international and national UNV volunteers assisted indigenous communities living in areas afflicted by increasing poverty and environmental degradation .  
The most accurate assessment of the state of the economy is derived from the 1998 population census . 19 Some key comparisons with the previous census ( 1987 ) are set out below ; all these indicators show a steady improvement in the islands standard of living : 
Given the absence of a statutory minimum wage in the HKSAR , how does the Government determine whether average earnings are sufficient to secure an adequate standard of living for workers and their families ?  
There were tangible improvements in 1999 : wages in the public sector increased by 50 per cent ; scholarships were doubled ; pensions were indexed on a permanent basis and now almost equal the minimum standard of living .  
UNDP defines poverty as human poverty , deprivation in the most basic choices people have such as to live a long and healthy life , to be educated , to have the means to a decent standard of living and to be able to be a part of the life of a community . 
This instrument recognizes the right to an adequate standard of living , social security , the right to work and just and favourable conditions of work , and the right to education , in addition to traditional civil and political rights .  
Despite a desire to establish wages at a level commensurate with the people 's standard of living , this is conditioned by the economic power and financial possibilities both at macro and micro levels .  
The minimum standard of living is established on the basis of baskets of indispensable things such as food , clothing , lodging and items of hygiene , calculated according to the population segments in urban and rural areas .  
The constitutional provision on the right of the citizens to live in a healthy and safe environment may rightfully be regarded as a key requirement applied to housing which constitutes living space for a human being .  
By contributing to the Fund , donors express their solidarity with the victims , enabling them to receive medical , psychological , financial , social or legal assistance and thus to resume living a decent life .  
Contrary to the expectations of its population , the transition from a totalitarian to a democratic system based on the market economy is taking place during a profound economic crisis that has been accompanied by a marked reduction in living standards .  
These traditional values have formed a firm foundation which has yielded a prosperous nation with strong family bonds and leadership committed to raising the standard of living for all the nations citizens .  
The living conditions in this camp are harsh , especially for widows , elderly women and the many children , who often live in an intolerably precarious state , suffering from illnesses , malnutrition and the cold .  
In general , the Committees deliberations were taking place against a sombre backdrop half the worlds population living in absolute poverty , increasing numbers of homeless persons , a soaring population , rapid urbanization and the growth of megacities .  
It also imposed harsh restrictions that prevented the population living under occupation from farming and benefiting from its agricultural land , and destroyed mature , productive trees .  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of nondiscrimination ( art . 2 ) is not fully implemented for children living in the outer islands and in poor urban communities , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
The Committee notes with concern that children living in the outer islands do not have adequate access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources aimed at promoting the childs development and physical and mental health .  
The country with a relatively large , heterogeneous population living in crowded urban conditions did not possess sufficient resources to enable it to accept an uncontrolled influx of migrants without extensive social and economic disruption .  
The Minister defined the key objective of the Government as fighting poverty and improving the living conditions of the population by developing strong partnerships with the private sector , civil society and the donor community .  
The benefits derived from the mobilization of scarce financial resources via international capital flowing to the most productive uses have contributed to economic growth and increased standards of living in all regions of the world .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
A genuine and sustainable peace can be achieved only when proper living conditions are insured for all our inhabitants and when there is a sufficient level of economic development for everyone to meet his basic needs , when fundamental human rights are respected and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic channels .  
Finally , I would like to express our fervent hope that through the joint efforts of the two parties , assisted by the international community , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be ultimately resolved so that peace will return to the entire Middle East region and the peoples of Palestine and Israel will enjoy living side by side in their own countries , secure in peace , prosperity and dignity .  
In order to preserve equivalent standards of living at different offices , the Secretary-General may adjust the basic salaries set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the present annex by the application of non-pensionable post adjustments based on relative costs of living , standards of living and related factors at the office concerned as compared to New York . Such post adjustments shall not be subject to staff assessment .  
His Government planned to involve civil society , particularly non-governmental organizations , in implementing the new approach and was engaged in consultations with them on a number of issues ( inter alia , improving the living conditions of displaced persons in camps , protecting their civil rights , implementing job-creation projects for them , improving understanding of the basic principles of the new UNHCR approach ) .  
Individuals living in the contaminated areas showed increased morbidity due to diseases of the endocrine , circulatory and digestive systems , as well as a higher rate of mental disorders , but it was difficult to interpret those results .  
For this reason , the International Movement ATD Fourth World wishes to draw attention to the fate of millions of poor children born this year , who , owing to the slowness of the measures being implemented , will be lifelong victims of hunger ; to the millions of boys and girls forever deprived of an elementary education ; to the millions of parents living in roadside huts ; to the millions of fathers seeking work in vain ; and to the millions of mothers robbed of any hope of immediate improvement .  
The declaration should affirm the right of every human being hence , also those who are deprived of all their essential rights , wherever in the world they may be to live in an environment in which their human dignity is respected and to enjoy their fundamental rights fully and completely and thus be able to assume their responsibilities towards their families and communities .  It should take into account the efforts and initiatives of individuals and groups living in extreme poverty .  
While external financing was essential for achieving the rates of growth required to attain a marked improvement in living standards and a significant reduction of poverty in Africa , the inflow of foreign direct investment to the region was still very low , and Africa suffered from volatility in capital flows , as well as exchange rate instability and misalignment resulting from rapid liberalization of the capital account .  
To that end , the international community must take the economic , social and cultural aspects of human rights into account by promoting and implementing the relevant international conventions so that they could have a real impact on those rights and on the improvement of the living conditions of all people .  
For ethical and practical reasons , the vicious circle of poverty and lack of access to modern technological resources must be broken , and a virtuous circle established in which such technology made it possible to achieve better standards of living .  
Member States should be invited to consider adopting at the national level such measures , including legislation , that would ( a ) discourage all actions and activities , commercial or otherwise , that could be prejudicial to the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories ; and ( b ) promote full respect for the human rights of peoples living under foreign domination and facilitate their recourse to judicial proceedings in order to gain economic and social restitution .  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of non-discrimination is not fully implemented for non-citizen children , children belonging to minorities , including Roma children , poor or dysfunctional families , children with disabilities and children living in rural areas , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
In light of articles 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 and 27 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to take all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of its available resources , in particular at the local level , to support families in a difficult economic and / or social situation in order to ensure , to the maximum extent possible , the survival and development of all children living in Latvia .  
In light of its previous concluding observations and taking note of efforts by the State party to combat poverty and its negative effects on children , the Committee remains concerned at the large disparities in the enjoyment of economic and social rights , particularly health and education , by children living in rural areas and regions lagging behind in socio-economic development .  
In light of articles 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 and 27 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to take all appropriate measures , such as the adoption and enforcement of the Programme of Assistance to Families Raising Children , to the maximum extent of its available resources and in particular at the local level , to support families in a difficult economic and / or social situation in order to ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of all children living in Lithuania , without discrimination .  
The Committee is concerned , further , at the low standard of the living conditions in some alternative care institutions , the inadequate monitoring of placements and the limited number of qualified personnel in this field .  
The Committee remains deeply concerned at the weakness of family links , at the large numbers of children who have been deprived of a family environment and , in particular at reports regarding : difficulties and slow progress in tracing separated families and children ; the lack of adequate mechanisms of protection for children living in institutions ; the placement of children in institutions for long periods ; and the predominant use of placement in institutions in preference to the development of alternative care measures ( e.g . , adoption and foster care ) . 
Note with grave concern the negative effects on health and the environment of environmental racism suffered , in particular , by countries in Africa , including the illicit dumping of toxic wastes and substances , hazardous working and living conditions and dangerous methods of extracting natural resources .  
Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , peace , democracy , justice , equality , rule of law , pluralism , development , better standards of living and solidarity ,  
Tribute should be paid to the organizations of the United Nations system , Governments and the international community , especially non-governmental organizations , for the work they were doing to help , at both the psychological and the physical level , millions of children living in abject circumstances because they were victims of poverty , a precarious economic or social situation , sickness , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , disabilities or lack of legal protection .  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , peace , democracy , justice , equality , rule of law , pluralism , development , better standards of living and solidarity ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Calls upon all States to take all necessary measures to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by children with disabilities and , where necessary , to develop and enforce legislation against their discrimination to ensure dignity , promote self-reliance and facilitate the childs active participation in the community , including adequate and effective access to education of good quality for children with disabilities and their parents , taking into account the situation of children with disabilities living in poverty ;  
Mindful of the fact that the Asian and Pacific region has two thirds of the worlds population living under the absolute poverty level and the imperative of integrating environmental considerations into economic and social development , the programme will highlight a stronger poverty alleviation thrust , particularly in the areas of social development , population and rural and urban development , and environmental and natural resources management .  
The parliamentarians of the Republic of Belarus appeal to State parliaments and Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , business , financial , scientific and religious circles , social movements and funds , representatives of the mass media , their compatriots and all peoples of goodwill not to forget that the people of Belarus have been living in an environmental disaster area for many decades and need active assistance from the world community . 
This phenomenon of multiple job-holding is considered to be on the increase based on the observation of a local pollster , who points out that an increasing number of Jamaicans are being forced into additional employment on a part-time basis as a measure to counter the rising cost of living .  
Similarly , the Maintenance Act provides that parents have the responsibility to maintain their children , thus seeking to ensure that every child has a standard of living adequate for his physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development ( art .  27 ) .  
When the States adhered to the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in 1996 , they pledged to respect and guarantee to all individuals living in their territory , and who are under their jurisdiction , the rights recognized by the Covenant with no discrimination based on race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , social status , birth , or any other criteria .  
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
In the light of the International Bill of Rights , poverty may be defined as a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
While the rights enumerated in the Covenant , such as the right to an adequate standard of living , are of central importance to the poor , the Committee emphasizes that all civil and political rights , as well as the right to development , are also indispensable to those living in poverty.g  
In conclusion , anti-poverty policies are more likely to be effective , sustainable , inclusive , equitable and meaningful to those living in poverty if they are based upon international human rights .  
While we strive our best to mobilize domestic resources and to learn from best practices , the global community must help us with increased flows of official development assistance , better trading opportunities , expanded debt relief and support for institutional development so that our people , living in urban and rural areas alike , can lead a decent and productive life .  
Three basic acts a law on medicine , a law on epidemiological safety , and governmental regulations ensure that every member of society , including people living with HIV / AIDS , is entitled to access to information and education on health ; that HIV testing of an individual is voluntary and confidential ; that an infected individual may work at any trade or profession ; and that antiretroviral therapy for people with HIV infection is available free , so far .  
In May 2001 , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights adopted a statement on poverty which recognizes that poverty constitutes a denial of human rights and defines poverty as a human condition characterized by the deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ( A / CONF . 191 / BP / 7 ) .  
Recognizing that care , support and treatment can contribute to effective prevention through increased acceptance of voluntary and confidential counselling and testing , and by keeping people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups in close contact with health-care systems and facilitating their access to information , counselling and preventive supplies ;  
Affirming that beyond the key role played by communities , strong partnerships among Governments , the United Nations system , intergovernmental organizations , people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups , medical , scientific and educational institutions , non-governmental organizations , the business sector including generic and research-based pharmaceutical companies , trade unions , media , parliamentarians , foundations , community organizations , faith-based organizations and traditional leaders are important ;  
Refugees and displaced persons already for many years have been deprived of elementary living conditions and the exercise of the most fundamental human rights and freedoms , enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , including the right to live in dignity and safety and participate fully in social and economic life in their places of permanent residence .  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
The World Bank notes that if aggregate gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in developing countries over the next 15 years were to equal the average attained during the 1990s , then progress in poverty reduction would be even slower than in scenario B , and the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day at the end of the forecast period would be only marginally lower than in 1998 .  
Based on the recommendations of that meeting , ESCWAs work in the current biennium ( 2000-2001 ) is concentrated on policies to alleviate poverty , with emphasis on issues of poverty and youth , the role of income-generating activities among the poor , and improving the standards of living of local communities through microcredit lending and community development , based on an integrated regional training programme .  
Urgyen Trinley Dorje , the seventeenth living Buddha of the Karmapa order , left the Chub monastery in December 1999 with a small group of followers , leaving behind a letter in which he explained that he was going abroad to secure the traditional Black hat and sacred attributes of the living Buddha : In acting thus , I betray neither my country nor my people , nor my monastery nor its great priests . 
In keeping with its aim of overcoming economic , social and institutional obstacles that prevent the population from enjoying decent living conditions , the Government of the Republic is promoting a poverty-reduction strategy that includes short - , medium - and long-term goals .  Areas of action have been identified that call for both the State and society at large to work to reduce the magnitude of poverty , which affects the majority of the population .  
To ensure that public resources have an impact on the living conditions of the target population , studies are being conducted in connection with the third phase of the integrated financial administration system ( Sistema Integrado de Administracin Financiera SIAF ) , which is responsible for preparing and executing the national budget .  The aim is to incorporate decentralized , autonomous and local entities into the system so as to enhance effectiveness and guarantee transparency in public administration .  
A Commission for Social and Human Development has been set up and five key elements for the development policy have been defined : to satisfy at least the minimum requirement of Mexicans with respect to food , housing and education ; to apply a measure of equity in all government policies ; to focus on the population living in extreme poverty , particularly indigenous peoples ; to promote social cohesion and community spirit ; and to protect the environment .
