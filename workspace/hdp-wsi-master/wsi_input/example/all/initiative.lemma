We should extensively engage in cooperation and exchanges with other countries , fully capitalize on the favorable conditions stemming from our contacts with relevant organizations in foreign countries and our understanding of the latest developments abroad , and take the initiative in helping enterprises improve their production techniques , technological standards , and product quality .  
Public security Minister Jia Chunwang pointed out at a news briefing held today : The public security organs at all levels must adhere to the guiding principle of taking the initiative to grasp problems in real earnest and on an earlier date and should firmly keep the initiative in work .  Grasping problems in real earnest does not mean staging a show for the leaders and masses .  Rather , it means daring to crack hard nuts in real earnest ;  
The work of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese must serve the general principles and policies of the Party and the state , serving our three major missions focused on economy building , and stimulating the initiative of the masses of overseas Chinese both in China and abroad , for a wholehearted and active contribution to the renaissance of the Chinese nation .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Whether viewed through the prism of history or the present , there are bright prospects for Sino-Russian cooperation .  The Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership established at the initiative of Chinese and Russian leaders has promoted the comprehensive development of exchanges and cooperation in various fields between the two countries , advanced the movement toward a multipolar world , and enhanced the international standing of both countries .  
It is necessary to seriously sum up the experiences of practice , further perfect the relevant policies on reforming the grain circulation setup , and persist in wide-open purchase of the peasants ' surplus grain at protected prices ; at the same time , we should appropriately readjust the scope and relevant policies of purchasing grain at protected prices , so as to protect the peasants ' initiative in growing grain , promote restructuring of agricultural production , and reduce the state 's financial burden .  
Deputy Huang Ju said : Our country is comparatively short of natural resources in terms of per capita quantities .  After economic development reaches a certain level , when facing the rapid scientific and technological progress in the world and the accelerating process of economic globalization , we may take the initiative in moving out of our national boundary and participate in international economic division of work and cooperation at a higher level .  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , the egalitarian system of eating from the same big pot in rural areas has been broken , households have become the main entities for economic operation and investment , and peasants have continuously increased their initiative in participating in the social , political , and economic lives .  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  
Proceeding from the requirements of future local wars under hi-tech conditions , this general unit has taken the initiative to raise the starting point and level of difficulty of training and made positive efforts to explore new training programs , such as comprehensive training for naval formation , in recent years .  
The ideal and belief education should be effectively combined with the in-depth education in the party 's basic line so that people may understand how the party 's basic line can turn the ideal into reality and play a role as a bridge between the initial stage of socialism and the more beautiful future , and understand the strong effectiveness of the party 's basic line since the beginning of reform and opening-up and the strong vitality of the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , thus enhancing their initiative in implementing the party 's basic line .  
To conduct the in-depth ideal and belief education , it is necessary to greatly carry forward the Marxist fighting and critical spirit , firmly hold the initiative in the ideological struggle , watch out for symptoms of incorrect tendencies , check erroneous ideas at the outset , nip an evil in the bud , always guard against the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and values , resist the offensive from various anti-Marxist ideological trends , enable people to more clearly understand and more firmly adopt the correct ideal and belief through the ideological struggle .  
In 1999 , various localities had , in line with the CPC Central Committee 's unified arrangements , conscientiously implemented the principle of " singing aloud the major theme song and of seizing well initiative , served the overall situation by concentrating efforts on the central task of economic construction , done a massive amount of meticulous work , and scored marked success .  
to insure that all could , on a basis of their own initiative , learn revolutionary theories , guard and fight against the corrosion of corrupt ideology and culture , persistently struggle against schools of reactionary ideological trends , against idealistic and pseudoscientific ideologies ; that all should take in fact the Marxist world outlook , outlook on life , values , and take the initiative in socialist cultural civilization construction ;  
Under the present turbulent and unstable international situation , we should pay special attention to the diversified forms and channels of making use of foreign capital so that we can gain the initiative in absorbing foreign capital .  
As far as the present situation is concerned , making full preparations for military combat ( jun shi dou zheng ) is the most realistic and urgent strategic mission for the whole army .  This will have a bearing not only on the realization of the great cause of reunifying the motherland but on whether our army will be able to have the strategic initiative in hand in the future .  
Through reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , clearly explaining the common interest relations and our trans-century development objectives , plans , and policies among the masses though propaganda and inculcation , we shall make the 1.2-billion people share the same ideological base , hold the same ideal and belief , and strive for the same goal .  Thus , greater enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity will burst forth among our people in their joint struggle for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
However , under the current material conditions , ideological and political work can solve problems in people 's minds to different degrees , can better give play to the initiative role of people 's mentality , and make up for the temporary shortage of the material forces with people 's mental forces .  This will prompt the people to create more material wealth .  
In future regional wars , our strong adversaries who possess high-tech weaponry may engage us in aerial battles with their superior technology .  These battles will be abrupt and decisive .  Our adversaries will go all out to seize the initiative by taking full advantage of nighttime and complex weather conditions .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
While people were sighing in despair , the special administration region government took drastic measures on its own initiative to strengthen the linked exchange rate system , drove international speculators out of Hong Kong , and stabilized the securities market and financial market , thus proving the pessimistic predictions of some people to be untrue .  
Therefore , the unit , relying on its own efforts in the face of these difficulties , took the initiative in carrying out coordinated training with a transportation regiment of the military region , a helicopter wing , and a naval test base under the support of the military region 's relevant department .  For the first time in the entire armed forces , it conducted a long-distance three-dimensional maneuver for its troops by four transportation methods - - " sea routes , air links , railways , and highways " .  The maneuver was a success .  
The competition of comprehensive national strength in the 21st century is , in the final analysis , the competition of the quality of people and talent .  Social science plays a very important and irreplaceable role in developing people 's wisdom , cultivating talent with both ability and political integrity , arousing people 's initiative and creativeness , and strengthening the rallying power of people of the whole country .  
At the Central Committee Ideological and Political Work Conference , Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized that , in the face of the new circumstances and new situation , ideological and political work must make efforts to carry out innovation and improvement on a foundation of carrying on and developing superior traditions and in such areas as content , form , method , means , and mechanisms .  In particular , he stressed , efforts must be made to heighten the sense of the times and strengthen direction , effectiveness , and initiative .  
It has upheld singing out the principal melody , successfully fought the battle of initiative , grasped the important issues , taken education and trust in ideals as the core , strongly propagated patriotism , collectivism , and socialism , deeply implemented the Party 's fundamental theory , its basic line , its basic education on guiding principles , established a correct world view , outlook on life , and value judgments .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
Over the last 20 years or so , the broad masses of the people have emancipated their minds and acted on an unprecedented historical initiative and proceeded from a highly developed sense of responsibility for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to offer ideas and contribute methods for the reform and opening up and undertakings of modernization drive and actively study new situations and resolve new issues in the light of the actual conditions .  
In accordance with its peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , China did not draw ideological lines but respected the political system which these countries had chosen , rapidly extended diplomatic recognition to those states which emerged as independent from the former Soviet Union , and established diplomatic relations with them .  
At the central conference on ideological and political work , Chairman Jiang clearly pointed out : " On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions , we must strive to innovate in and improve the contents , forms , methods , means , mechanisms , and other aspects of our ideological and political work ; we must especially increase the purposefulness and practical results of this work and enhance our initiative in this regard .  
strengthen basic research and applied basic research , focus our attention on making breakthroughs in such aspects as information technology , biotechnology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing technology , and aeronautic and aerospace technology , and enhance the capability of making innovations on our own initiative in certain high-tech spheres that have a bearing on the nation 's economic lifeline and security .  
At all times and in all situations , the banner of the Party should treated as the one banner , initiative must be taken in assuming the task of carrying out the Party 's Central Committee 's and Military Commission 's instructions and directives , a perfect mastery of the political issues in the General Political Department and units directly under its supervision is ensured , and a correct line of guidance for political work of the armed forces is ensured .  
To increase the quick response capacity and the capacity to gain the initiative by striking first by the destroyers , the technical personnel of the squadron have boldly reformed the traditional methods for checking missiles before they are launched .  They have invented a way to check missiles quickly and to optimize the checking procedures without changing the technical performance of missiles .  This has greatly increased the response capacity of the system of multi-series vessel missiles and has ensured " launching missiles before the enemy . "  
Not only has it been innovative in adopting new ideological concepts and modes of thinking in carrying out its domestic construction , it has also changed the isolationism of its past foreign policy , enthusiastically taking the initiative in developing relations with various countries .  
Developing a good system and social environment conducive to bringing into play the initiative and creativity of scientific and technological personnel is a major pressing strategic task .  We must step up the reform of the scientific personnel system , take additional steps to formulate and perfect all kinds of encouragement policies and measures .  
Faced with the extremely sharp and complicated international struggle , in the past 10-plus years , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core judged the hour and sized up the situation , took the initiative , maneuvered among various states , and defeated western hostile forces ' attempts to disturb us .  Under the leadership of the CPC , a socialist China , with a strong posture , is standing in the east of the world .  
Deputy Ren Shimao , Secretary of the Huangshi municipal party committee , noted : those enterprises that intend to go abroad must upgrade their business management concepts , which include : taking the initiative in striking out on the international market , being prepared for surviving and growing amid fair competition in the international and domestic markets , attaching great importance to information collection both at home and abroad , and respecting others ' intellectual property rights while safeguarding ours . 
The fact that under the staunch leadership of the party , the anti-separatist struggle in our region has turned from the state of passively meeting an emergency to one of taking the initiative to tackle problems in a comprehensive way and that our social and political situation remains stable shows that the 2.6-million people of all ethnic groups , the main body in the struggle against the separatist clique headed by the Dalai , are carrying out this struggle with strong determination , redoubled confidence , and high morale until they win a complete victory .  
They upheld selecting the best of the best to correctly select and assign capable commanding officers for brigades and regiments , adopted various patterns to strengthen the training for the leading organs of brigades and regiments , implemented patterns like armies and divisions working together , members of party standing committees having division of labor , and so on to examine and assist the building of brigades and regiments one by one , and unfolded the activities of appraising through comparison the advanced brigades and regiments to fully mobilize the initiative and creativity of brigades and regiments .  
But it still goes back to the same old question , that is , without the initiative of civil society , without the basis of full-scale economic division and full-scale division of social interests , and without the existence of a lenient and compromising political culture that is organically associated with such division of the socio-economic structure , it will end up with the same predicament of " quasi-multiparty system " in the early ROC years if what we have is merely the aspiration for the superficial efficacy of multiparty system .  
The gearing effect of improving and developing its relations with the United States will not only enable India to gain more strategic initiative in dealing with the other big powers and create an international and peripheral security environment to its own advantage , but it will all the more give impetus to India to make a big step forward to the world political and diplomatic arena .  
Hence , in the drive to " strike hard " and put things in order , it is necessary to make full preparations to consistently regard as the most important thing the crackdown on organized crime , especially organized crime of all kinds committed by backbone ethnic separatist elements , elements who commit bombing and terrorism , and extremist religious elements ; we must take the initiative to attack them , and hit them as soon as they show themselves .  
Speaking of China 's foreign policies , President Jiang stressed : Maintaining independence and keeping the initiative are the most salient characteristics of China 's diplomacy .  On various international issues , China has all along formulated her policies or positions by constantly proceeding from the fundamental , long-term interests of the Chinese people and the people the world over , and in light of right and wrong in specific issues as well .  
The Supreme People 's Procuratorate urges procuratorial and public security organs throughout the country to incorporate the special operation into the unified plans for the nationwide " strike-hard " campaign , and to continue to intensify efforts on the pursuit and arrest work .  It is necessary to truly implement the state 's criminal law and policy by honoring the policy of leniency for suspects who voluntarily surrender to the authority and who take the initiative to return illicit money .  
They should also emulate Wang Wei 's lofty ideological character of making selfless dedication , loving and respecting his work , disregarding personal gains and loses , and being indifferent to fame and profit so that they will be able to take the initiative to subordinate themselves to and serve the cardinal needs of reform and construction , cultivate a fine moral character , establish a lofty goal of life , and maintain the unchangeable integrity of revolutionary military personnel .  
Especially at a time when the country is engaged in launching the important reform projects of building a socialist market economic system and restructuring the financial and tax policies , the ministry has taken the initiative in supporting and guiding Tibet 's financial reforms in accordance with Tibet 's actual situation .  
We must , with a strong sense of historic mission , actively plunge into the great practice of socialist modernization , and fully display our initiative and creativity to fulfill the key tasks in our country 's development in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan , and promote the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of the national economy .  
The judicial administrative departments and all police officers and public security cadres must seriously study the spirit of the work conference , take the initiative in plunging into the hard-striking anti-crime struggle and various tasks for the comprehensive maintenance of law and order , and make contributions to achieving the objective of markedly improving the law-and-order situation within two years as required by the central leadership .  
It should be emphasized that the " five breakthroughs and one enhancement " form an integral whole .  Inherent close links exist among the major tasks involved and between the major tasks and other tasks .  To emphasize the integrity of the trade union work is to emphasize the unity and inherent link between the protection and the development of initiative of workers and staff members .  
In order to gain the initiative in maneuver operations at night , this regiment actively organized pilots to conduct night maneuvers at unfamiliar airports , aviation routes , airspace and environment ; laid ambushes ; and made long-distance raids and carried out other difficult training subjects in an effort to vigorously improve the quality of flights as well as the organizational planning and command coordination ability of commanders , and tempered their mentality , technology , and other comprehensive qualities .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .  This will aid in protecting and advancing peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region as well as in the world .  No matter how military planning is strengthened , advocacy of containment of China is contrary to the historical trend and is entirely wrong and will get nowhere .  
Raidi , chairman of the Tibet regional people 's congress standing committee , said : Currently Tibet is in the best period in history .  Tibet has been enjoying social progress , economic prosperity , and ethnic unity ; frontier defense in Tibet is ensured ; people of Tibet have been living and working in peace and contentment ; and the anti-splittism struggle has developed from being in a passive position and taking measures to cope with emergencies to taking the initiative to deal with things .  These achievements have not come by easily .  
Economically , the relationship of production characterized by the monopoly of the three major estate-holders was abolished , and ownership by individual farmers and herdsmen was established .  The vast number of former serfs and slaves began to possess their own land , sheep , cattle , and means of production .  This greatly aroused their initiative for production and emancipated the productive forces .  
Particularly since the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , the region has taken the initiative in launching offensive and sought both a permanent cure and a temporary solution to the separatist problem .  The in-depth anti-separatist struggle in the political , ideological , educational , and cultural fields has dealt a crashing blow to all kinds of separatist activities , reversed the passive situation , and retaken the initiative .  As a result , basic stability of Tibet 's social and political situation has been maintained for a fairly long period .  
Only evaluating " horses " will be tantamount to give the power of initiative on personnel training to history , making the difficult process of personnel training a process of living or dying without external interference .  When there is an urgent need , there will be shortages of needed personnel , and it then becomes necessary to pick the taller ones among short people .  
We should accurately determine and promptly adjust the stress of preventing job-related crimes according to the party and state 's major measures and strategic plans for reform and development in the period , the situation in the occurrence of cases and crimes , social hot spots , problems about which the masses complain strongly , and symptomatic and tendentious issues ; we should find the right places to penetrate and open a breach in work , open work fields , strengthen our initiative in work , and achieve better actual results .  
Your distinguished nation has pursued a foreign policy of maintaining independence and keeping initiative in one 's own hands , has protected world peace and promoted joint progress , and has played an increasingly important role in international and regional affairs .  
All relevant troops , academies , and scientific research units have taken the initiative to contact the stationed areas , understand the technological items urgently needed in local construction , and organize all forces and spare no efforts to engage in research and development of the items .  As a result , some major technological difficulties encountered in implementing the key state , provincial , and city engineering projects in the western area have been resolved .  
As far as capital - and technology-intensive industries are concerned , therefore , if they only look inward , they are bound to be hit hard by China 's accession to WTO and may even collapse .  But if they seize the initiative to set up joint ventures with foreign investors and put foreign funds , technology , and management to use , they will put themselves in an invincible position .  
For example , they are in favor of safeguarding and abiding by the 1992 " Anti-Ballistic Treaty " that forms the cornerstone for strategic stability and the foundation for the reduction of strategic offensive weapons , and are opposed to the deployment of closed theater missile defense systems by blocs of countries in the Asia-Pacific region .  They also support the initiative to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Asia , and support the efforts of and leading role played by the United Nations in the settlement of conflicts in Afghanistan and other issues .  
It is necessary to further understand that safeguarding workers ' legitimate rights and interests is the basic function and basic working channel for a trade union .  The trade unions should strive to properly protect and mobilize and guide the initiative and creativity of the vast mass of workers , and through various forms of mass economic and technical activities , organize and guide such initiative and creativity to serve the purpose of fulfilling various tasks set forth by the party and the government .  
We have taken the initiative in participating in multi-lateral and bilateral economic and trade cooperation , played an active and important role in the APEC and other international economic and trade organizations , and entered the final stage of negotiations on accession to the WTO .  
Marxism-Leninism and its creative development in China have fundamentally enhanced the spirit of the Chinese nation , greatly strengthened the historical initiative of the Chinese communists and the Chinese people to push forward China 's social development and make the great cause of ours to constantly forge ahead toward the lofty objectives along with the steps of the times .  
To raise the ideological and ethical standards and scientific and cultural levels of the workers , peasants , intellectuals , and other laboring people and the entire population and improve their work skills and creativity and give full scope to their enthusiasm , initiative , and creative power - - these should remain the tasks of primary importance that our party should perform in representing China 's advanced productive forces .  
To always represent the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people , our party must , in all kinds of work including party 's theory , line , program , principle and policy , persevere in taking the fundamental interests of the people as the starting point and ultimate goal , bring into full play people 's enthusiasm , initiative and creativity , and enable the people to constantly obtain tangible economic , political and cultural benefits through continuous social development and progress .  
Our party should always represent the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  Our party must , in all kinds of work including party theory , line , program , principle and policy , persevere in taking in the fundamental interests of the people as the starting point and purpose , bring into full play people 's enthusiasm , initiative and creativity , and enable the people to constantly obtain tangible economic , political and cultural benefits through continuous social development and progress .  
We should do so by starting with leaders in various financial institutions .  We should uphold healthy trends , develop new practices , enhance institutional initiative and creativity , and carry out to the letter , the decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council . We should make fresh , and greater contributions , through pushing forward a financial reform , rectifying financial order , stepping up financial supervision and control , and heightening operational efficiency , and should guard against and alleviate financial risks , and support national economic development as well .  
Launching a psychological offensive in conjunction with military action and breaking down the enemies ' morale through applying psychological pressure that leads to their defeat and to the seizing of the initiative in a war has been a favorite method embraced by both Chinese and foreign military thinkers both ancient and modern times .  
After this case took place , 100,000 people in Okinawa held a large-scale demonstration , calling for revising the unequal status of forces agreement .  But , Japan and the United States only revised the detailed rules for implementing the agreement and set forth that the US side may give " sympathetic consideration to Japan 's requirements " before hearing major cases , such as rape and murder .  However , as a matter of fact , the US side still gains the initiative .  
In order to ensure the educational activities of studying " three represents " at the level of villages to develop in a healthy manner , all counties should proceed from the different situations of economic development levels , organizations at village levels , and contingents of cadres to select several villages for making earnest experiments .  And every province should also directly run several experimental villages to explore and accumulate experiences , so as to master the initiative in providing work guidance .  
Zhang Qiyue said , as everyone knows , China practices a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and its military expenditure has always been at a low level among major world powers .  
We should study the new phenomenon that corruption breeds and becomes rampant during the period of economic structural change and rapid economic growth .  We should further define our thinking and policy , based on the analysis and study , for the case handling work under the new circumstances .  Only in this way can we firmly keep the initiative in our hands during the anti-corruption struggle and punish corruption in a more forceful and effective way .  
Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the vast number of intellectuals has demonstrated their unprecedented initiative and creativity .  Scientists and technical experts , taking aim at the world 's cutting-edge technologies , are working with daring in scaling the heights of science and technology ; and they have achieved great successes in developing proprietary high technologies , which are close to or have reached the world 's advanced levels .  
The newest session of the county committee and the county government undertook a firm and swift investigation on their own initiative and corrected the situation ; 20 cadres received party discipline and punishment by the government ; salaries given to 140 persons were cancelled after verification , and relevant leadership and responsible people received official notification of criticism .  
actively organize and encourage both army troops and militia reserves to plunge themselves in the current large-scale development of the country 's western region ; take up urgent , difficult , dangerous , and heavy tasks on our own initiative ; and strive for dual effects of promoting economic development and consolidating the defense building in line with the principle of manufacturing products for both peacetime and wartime use and for both military and civilian use .  
In respect of science , education , and qualified personnel , it is necessary to strengthen compulsory and elementary education , make a breakthrough in developing high-tech projects , import qualified personnel from other regions and , at the same time , train local talented personnel , bringing into full play the initiative of the existing talent .  
In a modern war where the use of force sees no bounds , the weak are still nations outside of the West , because the Western nations so far are in control of the initiative for technological and scientific advancements and the resulting military advantages .  In a war where the two opposite sides have no rules but make massacre their ultimate goal , the victor will still be the side with technology and material superiority .  
The top level in Beijing believes that peaceful reunification must be guaranteed by powerful military force and correct strategic design , otherwise , the initiative in cross-strait relations will be lost .

The top level in Beijing believes that peaceful reunification must be guaranteed by powerful military force and correct strategic design , otherwise , the initiative in cross-strait relations will be lost .  
Under the new circumstance , it is the military academies ' central task to cultivate new-type and high-quality military talents , who have comprehensive and excellent development in aspects such as ideological and political building , scientific and cultural building , military profession , and physical and psychological strength , and are endowed with comprehensive knowledge and talents as well as the spirit and ability to make initiative .  
Since we have consistently attached importance to and persistently grasped ideological and political work as the central link , the central policy decision has deeply penetrated into people 's minds , and this has effectively eliminated interference in ideological understanding , mobilized the activism and initiative of all sectors , formed a powerful spiritual motive force for impelling the work , and ensured the smooth implementation of the central policy decision .  
Of equal importance is the fact that we must use practical and effective measures to deal with the Taiwan authorities in international " human rights above sovereignty " activities .  In particular , regarding the activities they carry out in western countries , we must have a plan for response , we must take initiative , and we must have a definite scope and counterpoint .  
If we do not speed up development of China 's economic and scientific and technological undertakings and work hard to narrow the gap with advanced global levels , we will have a difficult time taking hold of initiative in the fierce international competition .  
That is why we must take the initiative in conforming to the trend of the global economic integration , positively readjust China 's agricultural industrial structure , cut down the proportion of grain production , and more thoroughly participate in the international division of labor with regard to grain production and conduct more international grain transactions .  
Responsible person : Since the 14th Party Congress , propaganda work in newspapers and periodicals has achieved very good results in holding the banner aloft , maintaining unanimity , serving the overall situation , focusing on the central tasks , promoting reform and development , preserving social stability , singing the theme in a series of major propaganda tasks , fighting a successful battle of initiative , providing correct guidance , and performing in a lively and vigorous way ; it has thus created a very good public opinion atmosphere for reform , opening up , and modernization .  
The North and the South have markedly enhanced their mutual trust .  When problems occurred , Kim Chong-il and Kim T'ae-chung exercised restraint and took the initiative to express their goodwill toward each other .  Their unremitting efforts and correct decisions have eventually been crowned with the historical summit .  
We should build a corps of high-quality cadres who should be politically firm and who are able to cope with all kinds of dangers and are skillful in dealing with complicated situations .  All these are for the purpose of enabling our party to meet challenges , grasp the opportunity , gain the initiative , bring about development , and gain a favorable strategic position in the 21st century .  
We must strengthen our investigations and studies of the trend of social thinking as well as the characteristics and the rules of changes in thinking among young officers and soldiers .  We must strengthen our studies on major theoretical and practical issues that will have impacts on the thinking activities among officers and soldiers .  We should have an initiative in carrying out the ideological and political work .

In vigorously grasping implementation , it is necessary to enhance and improve the party 's ideological and political work , and carry out some tangible innovation and improvement in its content , form , method , and means , on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward its fine traditions ; in particular , it is necessary to make big efforts in increasing the sense of the era and enhancing appropriateness , effectiveness , and initiative ; this will become the key point in enhancing and improving ideological and political work in the future .  
The meeting held that in theoretical work , it is necessary to stress the main theme , take the initiative , scientifically and vividly publicize Marxism , and lead the cadres and masses to continually overcome and resist the influence and erosion of wrong , backward , and corrupt ideological education .  
Old-age work is an important part of the socialist modernization undertaking , and we must make centralized plans , set up a reasonable pattern , plant our foothold in the present but set our sight in the future , and start out from this country 's basic situation to uphold the guiding principle that includes the government 's leadership , society 's initiative , the people 's participation , and orderly development .  
The earlier we understand the economic structure problem and make structural readjustment , the earlier we will have the initiative in our hands .  If we are late in knowing the problem and slow in solving it , we will land ourselves in a passive position .  
While visiting that enterprise , Hu Jintao went to its workshops , teams , and groups to chat cordially with workers and staff members ; he encouraged them to seize the opportunity to work with a will to make the country strong , to rely on the collective and on scientific and technological innovations to gain the initiative in intense market competition at home and abroad , and to keep scoring outstanding achievements .  
Second , as Anhui is the first stop in the industrial transference from the eastern region to the western region , we should take the initiative in receiving the radiation of the eastern region to develop our primary industry , and also spin-off projects and enterprises with certain technical content , good market prospects , and powerful pulling force to settle down in Anhui . 
Wu Bangguo emphasized that funds for migrants have a bearing on the migrants ' vital interests , and whether they are used well or badly will have a great impact ; it is imperative to strengthen the management of funds for migrants , make public for compensation standards for the migrants , and take the initiative to accept supervision by the migrant masses ; it is essential to ensure that the funds that should be issued to migrants are sufficiently in place , and ensure the specific use of the specific funds .  
According to the source , the CPC holds that while in the process of " speeding up " industrialization , China is facing the rare opportunities of the extensive application of achievements in the scientific and technological revolution , the massive transformation of information technology , and the large-scale upgrading of traditional industries .  Hence , it must spur industrialization with informationization , give play to its advantage in " gaining the initiative by surpassing the early starters , " and strive to catch up from behind and realize the rapid development of the social productive forces .  
Only when we can achieve sustained , rapid , and healthy national economic development on a new basis will it be possible to ensure the fulfillment of the grand objectives set at the 15th National Party Congress ; only thus will it be possible to ensure that we will have the initiative in engaging in intense international competition .  
We should give full consideration to the characteristics of the ideological work , which should be adapted to the requirements of the socialist market economic system and which should be conducive to strengthening party leadership , to giving full play to the initiative of propaganda and cultural workers , and to promoting the development and prosperity of various undertakings .  We should publish more works of excellence to satisfy the increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .

Article 30If mine safety inspectors discover concentrations of natural gas , dust or other harmful poisonous gases above national safety standards or industry safety standards at a work site , removal of safety pillars by the mine on its own initiative , or use of flooding , blasting , tunneling or other dangerous methods which would influence the safety of nearby mine production , they shall order immediate work stoppage , and shall report the situation to the Mine Safety Supervision Organization .  
In the first 10 months of this year , the overall level of consumer prices rose by only 0.1 percentage point .  If the government 's initiative act of raising prices , such as increasing charges for housing and public services for citizens , are factored in , the growth in consumer prices will remain negative .  The decisive role of the relationship between market supply and demand is still quite unstable .  
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng stressed at the closing ceremony : As our country 's fiscal work will be faced with great opportunities and challenges in the new century , we must adapt to changes in the environment both at home and abroad , firmly grasp the initiative in fiscal work , and concentrate efforts on structuring a framework of public finance suited to the requirements of the socialist market economy and on building stable , balanced , and strong state finances to better serve the overall interests of economic and social development .  
Party committees and leading cadres at various levels should take the initiative in accepting supervision by democratic parties , be glad to have their errors pointed out , and readily accept good advice ; particularly , they should listen to words or advice unpleasant to hear and be tolerant of incisive criticisms ;  
The meeting pointed out that the existing Chinese People 's Liberation Army Ordinance Governing Officers on Active Duty , since its implementation in 1988 , has played an important role in enabling the officers of the People 's Liberation Army and the People 's Armed Police Force to become more revolutionary , younger in average age , better educated , and more professionally competent ; in boosting their initiative and creativity ; and in ensuring their observance of law in performing military duties .  
There is also need to constantly secure and develop the broadest possible patriotic united front , bring into play the initiative and creativity of all social circles , and gather the wisdom and forces of the entire Chinese people .  Only in this way , will we succeed in our cause and achieve bigger victories .  This is a basic theory .  
In the bill requesting deliberation on the draft revision , Premier Zhu Rongji and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin said : Since the regulations were put into force , they have played an important role in making the corps of our military officers more revolutionary , lowering the average age of officers , raising the their educational level , and making them more professionally competent , as well as heightening the initiative and creativity of the large numbers of officers .  
" We must fully understand the characteristic of Xinjiang 's anti-splittist struggle that it is protracted , acute and complex , unswervingly and firmly foster the idea that stability overrides everything , strengthen our sense of political responsibility in safeguarding Xinjiang 's stability , and stand on the forefront of the struggle consciously and on our own initiative to resolutely wage an uncompromising struggle against national splittism . "  
Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that China will continue to unswervingly pursue a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , make efforts to advocate world multipolarization , actively deal with economic globalization , further participate in international economic and trade , financial , and science and technology cooperation and regional cooperation , work to promote the establishment of a fair and rational new international political and economic order , and spur mankind 's just cause of peace and development .  
It must also help bring into play the initiative and creativeness of broadcast workers , help combine social benefits and economic benefits , help promote the sound and prosperous development of the broadcasting industry , and better meet the growing spiritual and cultural needs of the masses of the people .  
All party comrades , and all levels of leading cadres before all , must remain committed to the historical , practical , and developmental viewpoint of Marxism , insist that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth , display history-making initiative and revolutionary creativity , and make persistent efforts to study and tackle new problems .  
Through the implementation of the party 's rural policies and in-depth reforms , we should effectively protect , arouse , and give play to the initiative of the peasants .  This is the main driving force for increasing their income .  At the same time , the advantageous technological and intelligent conditions in the capital should be brought into full play ;  
fully release the initiative and creativity of the scientific and technological personnel , peasants , and enterprises in disseminating agricultural science and technology , adopt the forms of combining the rank of professionals with peasant organizations , combining the leading role of the government and the guiding role of the markets , and combining paid services with gratuitous services , and break a new path of scientific and technological dissemination that tallies with China 's national conditions .  
The first - generation party leadership launched the land revolution , which stimulated the initiative and creativity of the millions of peasants to a tremendous extent , smoothly completed the socialist transformation of agriculture and traditional industry , and laid the firm foundation for the initial stage of socialism .  
The broad masses of transferred military cadres , on the other hand , should preserve and carry forward the fine tradition of the people 's army , serve the interests of the whole , support the reform program , and show understanding and sympathy for the difficulties experienced by the state and local authorities in trying to settle them .  They should take the initiative to obey the arrangements made by the organization and work hard at their new posts to make fresh contributions to the cause of socialist modernization .  
This is naturally required of us in order to win the initiative in the intense international competition and is also an urgent necessity in order to solve the outstanding contradictions and problems facing China 's economic and social development .  
Through the formulation and implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , China will be able to better adjust its own pace of development , release the initiative of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , concentrate all efforts on the theme of " development , " and advance toward the strategic objective of building a moderately developed socialist country and enhancing the people 's living standards so that they are able to lead a fairly comfortable life .  
The party 's leading members of the third generation with Jiang Zemin at the core have taken Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guidance , once again demonstrated the grand breadth of commanding the view from high above and taking the overall situation into consideration , made a correct assessment and analyzed the situation in a calm manner , followed a correct policy , and firmly grasped the initiative in economic work amid the turbulent and complicated economic situation at home and abroad .  
To make development , it is necessary to further break through various institutional and functional obstacles through reforms and further emancipate the productive forces and arouse the people 's initiative and creativity and stimulate the dynamism of our society .  Without reform , it would be hard to further advance economic development and structural readjustments .  
Safeguarding the authority of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is our most cardinal political principle and discipline and represents the basic interests of the state , the nation , and the broad masses of people .  All officers and men of the PLA must have a highly unified thinking , maintain a very firm attitude , and act on their own initiative .  
In his speech , Deputy Wang Ke said : In doing the PLA 's logistic work , we must take the initiative to serve the needs of overall national economic construction .  At all times , we must maintain our fine traditions of hard struggle and building the army through diligence and thrift and must make a real effort to successfully manage and make good use of our limited money .  
This will require the enterprises to form , as soon as possible , flexible and effective mechanisms for stimulating their initiative and motivation to develop new technologies and make technological innovations that will win them a favorable position in the competition .  First of all , a breakthrough should be made in the distribution system and the employment system .  Effective incentive mechanisms should be set up to attract talented people to the state-owned enterprises for making technological innovations .  
The system of leading cadres taking the blame and resigning should be comprehensively introduced .  Those leading cadres who are directly responsible for major cases of law or discipline violation should not only be given appropriate disciplinary penalties , but also offer to resign on their own initiative .  If such a person fails to tender his resignation himself , it is suggested that the people 's congress at the same level and its standing committee should dismiss or replace him .  
deepen reforms , expand opening-up , strive to make the two fundamental changes , take the initiative in advancing in the front of institutional and technological innovations , actively make use of both domestic and overseas resources , open up both domestic and international markets , gather momentum and vigor of sustained development ;  
In accordance with the unified plans of the central authorities regarding the launching in the rural areas of in-depth educational activities based on the important " three represents " idea , we must organize grass-roots cadres in studying and understanding the central authorities ' policies concerning the reduction of the burden on peasants , enhance their policy awareness and legal mindedness , improve their work style , and boost their initiative in implementing the policies .  
Further expanding domestic demand will make it possible for us to have the initiative in our hands in developing the economy and maintaining sustained and steady economic growth , and this is also a strategic move in smoothly carry out the 10th Five-Year Plan and fulfilling the third-step development objective .  
The spokesman stressed that the scheme is not another type of care and attention home for the elderly but a specific housing initiative with integrated domestic and supportive components to enable the elderly to ' age in place ' and enjoy ' healthy ageing . ' "  
The InterPARES is a new international research initiative aiming at developing theoretical and methodological knowledge required for the permanent preservation of authentic records created in electronic systems .  
The language benchmark initiative arose from the Education Commission Report No . 6 , published in 1996 after two rounds of public consultation , which recognised the urgent need in Hong Kong to enhance the proficiency of Chinese ( including Putonghua ) and English of young people in order to meet changing political , economic , social and cultural demands . 
I am pleased to note that some Hong Kong lawyers have taken the initiative to develop a better understanding of the Mainland 's legal system .  It is being done with a view to ensuring that issues affecting both jurisdictions will be handled properly , all the while protecting the integrity of Hong Kong 's separate legal and judicial systems .  
Over 1,400 frail elders will receive enhanced home and community care services under a new initiative to be implemented next month ( March 2001 ) .  These elders are assessed to be of moderate level of impairment .  They need appropriate support in home help , personal care and nursing and allied health services so that they may continue to live at home .  Support will also be rendered to family members who care for their elders .  
The avant-garde artists , on their own initiative , grouped in 1912 in the " Section d'or " exhibition held at the La Boetie , wanted to collectively show their works , which were proclaimed as " Cubist " , and mocked by the journalists and the general public , as a form of reply or as a defensive position .  The exhibition was chiefly seeking a common guiding aesthetic principle , to recreate the visual values of objects and forms .  
" We want the most capable people , those who are prepared to work hard , show initiative and leadership and are committed to Hong Kong 's future to apply for this stimulating and highly influential position , " Secretary for the Civil Service , Mr Joseph W P Wong , said .  
That is why in our education reforms , while continuing to make primary and secondary education even more widely available , while committing to improve the quality of our entire public school system , we have also put in place the important initiative to enhance the competitiveness of direct subsidy scheme schools , and to help more private schools to meet the diverse quality needs of different parents and students .  
" The Science and Technology subject is an initiative to provide students with a broad and balanced curriculum .  It is particularly valuable to non-science students , providing them with additional learning experiences on modern scientific and technological developments , " he explained .  
The land lots owned by HA account for about 73.3 per cent of the total amalgamated area .  Had the HA not taken the initiative to redevelop NPE , the potential of this prime site would not have been released for the benefit of the entire community .  The reason is that the public transport interchange and open space are earmarked as GIC and recreational use respectively in the outline zoning plan , rendering the present development potential of these two sites to be minimal .  
Speaking after the meeting , the Secretary for Commerce , Industry and Technology , Mr Henry Tang said : " We are glad that this private sector initiative is gaining momentum and continual support with the positive response from the international and local chambers of commerce as well as other business and professional bodies .  
" We appreciate the effort of the operating agencies , including non-government organisations and private operators , for taking initiative to freeze or reduce their fee charges .  Their act has demonstrated their commitment in running quality service while at the same time sharing jointly parents ' financial burden under this stagnant economic environment , " the spokesman said .  
Here 's something that makes for an interesting comparison : In the 1992 legislative elections , Chou Chuan , then still a member of the KMT , did n't obtain her party 's nomination , and she decided to run as an independent . According to Chou , there was a virtual media blackout about her campaign , until a cable system operator within her district took the initiative to broadcast a videotape of her describing her political views . Outsiders thus concluded that cable television played a great part in her election .  
Later on , the Puli Township public works bureau took the initiative to recruit scholars and relevant administrative agencies , holding the Puli High School Tamalin Ruins Investigative Conference , at which they decided a full-scale excavation ought to take place at the original test dig site . Up through the middle of April , the archaeological dig kept going .  
Perhaps the hardest thing to understand about these stories is how these elegant , genteel products of elite households , upon becoming ghosts , suddenly become audacious and passionate pursuers of love . They always take the initiative to strike up acquaintances and break the ice , volunteer themselves for passionate embraces , and have insatiable desire .  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
In addition , the author adopts a principle of " purposiveness " ( in which everything in life has some positive potential purpose ) , very akin to theology , to explain everything , and to persuade people of the wisdom of the definitive behavioral principles that can be expected to bring health and longevity . Individual initiative and moral responsibility are excluded completely .  
Professor Huang Ping-huang of the Department of Education at National Chengchi University ( NCCU ) also believes that initiative is the quality most lacking in today 's primary and middle school teachers : " They are so accustomed to eating instant noodles that they have forgotten how to cook . "  
Vice President Lu stressed that this initiative was undertaken in support of President Chen 's " go south " policy , aimed at opening up new horizons for Taiwanese business investment in Southeast Asia . Further , she expressed her gratitude to Indonesia 's ruling and opposition parties and to members of its private sector for extending their hand of friendship and courageously embracing Taiwan 's expressions of goodwill in defiance of a powerful country 's bullying bluster .  
In 1992 , Chiku Township began planning an industrial park in this area . Conservationists fought the initiative and eventually built a national consensus to " set aside a piece of pristine land for the black-faced spoonbills . " The birds ' nesting grounds were thus preserved , and scholars gradually began to get involved in research and conservation .  
Some months ago you ran a feature on digital content , and recently you also reported the development of nanotechnology in Taiwan . From these articles we can see how sensitive the government is to the development of new technologies , and how-whether by their own initiative or with government guidance-many large , medium and small enterprises are getting involved in R &amp; D or production related to these emerging technologies .  
This transformation is being pursued on the basis of new perceptions about development , which see in popular participation , individual and local initiative and private business activity the key to economic recovery and sustainable economic growth .  
On the contrary , a security system must be established that ensures the fiscal integrity of all persons , individual initiative and the inviolability of private property , through a stable monetary system and efficient public services .  
Notwithstanding the positive initiative taken by the major nuclear Powers since the end of the cold war , there is still a need to establish a close link between disarmament and international peace in the years ahead .  
The panel , balanced in its representation of members , would address this initiative in the light of the current international economic , administrative , regulatory environment .  
Despite the socioeconomic changes carried out in our States to stimulate private initiative and cooperative movements and to improve living conditions , the African continent is still experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis .  
The proposed initiative was designed to offer ways for the reasonable expression of plausible aspirations of that nature through free options ranging from limited and basic selfadministration to virtual internal selfgovernment .  
His Government had repeatedly expressed its opposition to that initiative because it clearly violated the most basic human rights of migrant workers and their families set forth in various international legal instruments .  
In addition , 74 supplementary reports containing additional information were received from the States parties , submitted either on the initiative of the States parties concerned or at the request of the Committee following its examination of their respective initial or periodic reports under the Convention .  
However , there is no doubt that progress towards a lasting , just and comprehensive peace is contingent on the continued , determined and coordinated efforts of the international community in the maintenance of a global approach to the current peace initiative and the continuation of the international sanctions against the Belgrade regime .  
Moreover , this initiative fell within a favourable context of human dimension and a framework of values and hopes that were largely shared by sovereign States and Governments linked by their use of the French language , which greatly helped the Agency first to be recognized internationally and then to grow .  
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
The Secretary-General , in his peacemaking initiative and in close consultation with the Security Council , sent to Tajikistan a small integrated United Nations unit of political , military and humanitarian officers to monitor the situation on the ground , provide liaison services and constitute a ground core for any possible more extensive United Nations participation in the regional efforts in Tajikistan in the future .  
These have been actively considered by UNDP within the broad framework of a strategic management initiative aimed at harmonizing three distinct components of UNDP programming : strategic planning - addressing its basic mission and strategies ; operational planning - focusing on means of achieving results ; and results management - analysing , through monitoring , review and evaluation , real performance against stated plans .  
It should be noted that , following a 1993 initiative of the World Bank , a growing number of financial institutions are meeting to discuss very practical affairs of common concern , such as procedures for assuring the environmental quality of projects and economic analysis of environmental projects .  
We cite in particular the call by the President of the Republic of Cyprus , Mr . Glafcos Clerides , who , during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Cyprus in October 1993 , urged the establishment of such a court and received a positive response by the other participants , who as is stated in the communiqu , " recognized that the successful culmination of this initiative could provide the international community with an important instrument against international crime " . 
There was great enthusiasm among the countries concerned for this major new initiative for South-South cooperation , which went beyond the objectives of the Caracas Programme of Action inasmuch as it sought , as the Group 's annual meetings progressed , to articulate at the level of heads of Government the economic problems faced by the South and to engage the North in a constructive dialogue .  
In support of the WH initiative and to meet needs identified in the field , a decentralized model of national participants , which includes information on types of teams ready for deployment and functional areas of expertise , could be envisaged as part of an overall roster system maintained by UNV in accordance with the parameters defined by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and UNV .  
While agreeing with the need for Headquarters to become more involved in validating the aircraft requirements of all missions , the Field Administration and Logistics Division stated that " since this recommendation would involve a major policy initiative , and would consequently entail a comprehensive review , we believe it more judicious to reserve our specific comments in this regard , pending the outcome of a complete evaluation " . 
The broad spectrum of activities of the countries covered above shows that the strategic planning initiative is not one specific blueprint but more of an agenda , an institutional vision which helps to direct , monitor and track performance to stated goals and objectives .  
The second model , the information initiative approach , requires a series of basic steps that generate high quality of information , which then can be utilized to identify ( a ) shortcomings in the current human resources capacities of the public sector ; ( b ) types of professional development programmes needed in order to upgrade the quality of the staff ; and ( c ) the knowledge and skills needed for those who will be recruited into the public sector .  
Regrettably , we must note that in Croatia the initial positive reaction to this initiative has been abandoned , and they have proved to be unprepared to begin a direct peaceful dialogue .  
To this end , we shall establish , based on the successful public / private sector Caribbean Coalition on Tourism Marketing Programme for North America , broad-based regional marketing programmes and joint representation in the major markets , including the intra-Caribbean market , on a sustainable basis , and develop , not later than the end of 1995 , a financing arrangement to sustain this initiative .  
At the initiative of Yugoslavia , a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries was held at Belgrade in February 1988 which laid down the foundations for the process of multilateral cooperation among the countries of the region and opened up perspectives for better understanding and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
At the second ministerial meeting of CBI in March 1994 , participating countries reaffirmed their commitment to the initiative and reported substantial progress with trade reform , particularly the elimination of trade licensing and other non-tariff barriers , liberalization of payments on the current account and in designing more liberal and transparent investment regimes .  
The decisive condition for their realization is the spontaneous initiative of individuals , first of all representatives of cultural and public life and of youth , with the financial assistance of national and international organizations and foundations .  
A special initiative entitled " Intensified cooperation with countries and peoples in greatest need " aims to enable poor countries to establish equitable and sustainable health systems tailored to their specific needs .  
NULLThe basic purpose of the proposed policy initiative would be to exploit to the maximum , and in a cost-effective manner , the savings and credit potential of the informal and semi-formal financial system ; to strengthen its ability to mobilize small savings from relatively marginal sections of population ; and to encourage decentralized lending , that is , in areas largely untouched by the formal financial system .  
NULLThe policy initiative should begin with national efforts to seek to determine the overall magnitude of operations and the role of the institutions in the informal sector , to understand how they work and how sets of unwritten rules and social conventions have guided and sustained them against risks inherent in financial transactions .  
The General Assembly has proclaimed 1998 to be the International Year of the Ocean . 158 / This initiative is expected to generate important cooperative efforts in the United Nations system 159 / and stimulate greater global awareness of the oceans and greater cooperation for the effective protection and management of marine and coastal areas and resources . 
An initiative put forward by the President of Russia , Mr . Yeltsin , has received broad international backing that is , the initiative on the holding in the spring of 1996 of a summit meeting on issues of nuclear security , to consider pressing problems in this area and define ways to solve them , in both the short and the long term .  
Regarding preparations at the national level , the Committee took note of the substantial progress achieved since the first substantive session , and further strengthened the best practices initiative on improving the living environment by further refining the criteria for nomination and the format for reporting on best practices .  
Taking into consideration the will of the Central American presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for Sustainable Development " 4 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a re-defining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
pointed out that the resolution mentioned above had been adopted on an initiative of the Sudan , motivated by its concern for the situation of more than 20,000 children who had been sequestered by the insurgent movement in the south of the country , which used them as explosives carriers , human shields in minefields and as a military reserve , a situation which was intolerable since it violated religious and humane principles .  
into consideration the will of the Central American presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for Sustainable Development " 4 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a re-defining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
also the initiative by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of establishing a pilot project of the Humanitarian Early Warning System , with the purpose of identifying potential crises with humanitarian implications through the analysis of its database , and welcoming further the establishment by the Department of Political Affairs , the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of interdepartmental consultations for the joint analysis of early warning of looming crises , within a broader framework for the coordination of operational planning and implementation among the three departments ,  
programme had been mentioned in two General Assembly resolutions , resolutions 48 / 132 and 49 / 194 , and represented not only an initiative designed to help Member States to build and strengthen their national capacities , but also an aspect of international action in the field of human rights which deserved recognition as being equal in importance to the monitoring mechanisms . 
However , if and when the financial target of the 20 / 20 initiative is attained , and even if more donors reach or surpass the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance , as the Netherlands did long ago , it will only have the hoped-for effect if there is a sufficiently competent and honest government machinery to administer these important funds .  
This set of realities has led Algeria , committed as it is to a vast process of economic reform , to formulate and implement a development strategy which , while subjecting the economy to the laws of the marketplace , will ensure the necessary balance between the various State functions , tying the powers of the public authorities in the coordination of economic activity to the desire to preserve to the greatest extent possible a patrimony that has been built up through the colossal efforts of our national community , while encouraging free enterprise and private initiative .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
Moreover , Greece has supported all international initiatives aimed at further promoting Balkan regional cooperation , such as the conference of ministers of southeastern Europe which convened this year in Sofia and which will meet again in Thessaloniki in June of next year the European Royaumont initiative and the United States southeast European cooperative initiative .  
The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
Working with partners in 18 countries , USAID is undertaking a learning process designed to explore and document new ways to build capacity and linkages among groups at the local level ; to forge solid society-to-society linkages between these local groups and their United States counterparts ; and to foster a legal , regulatory and fiscal environment conducive to citizen participation and community initiative .  
In this connection , it is pertinent to mention the recent meeting held in Oslo in April 1996 on the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , according to which interested developed - and developing-country partners will allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
In its review of Agenda 21 the special session should lay the grounds for further international cooperation , national and regional initiative , and the mobilization of resources for meeting the sustainable development needs of small island developing States .  
Since this initiative came to the General Assembly for the first time as a result of Nicaragua 's urgent needs in 1990 at the end of its decade-long armed conflict and of its starting on the path to democracy and economic and social development , we have seen emergency assistance to be a temporary but very effective mechanism to help resolve the difficult problems of transition .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa , adopted by the General Assembly in 1991 , was a good initiative aimed at giving the international community the opportunity to review the deteriorating economic and social conditions on the African continent with a view to finding the proper solutions for them and to renewing the commitment to support Africa 's efforts to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development .  
We are confident that the same initiative , determination and courage that the parties demonstrated in forging a historical framework for the peace and stability of the region can likewise be invoked to pave a new avenue built upon cooperation and coexistence that will eventually lead to a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region based on Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967 ) , 338 ( 1973 ) and 425 ( 1978 ) .  
Each nation is responsible for itself and must create , through rigorous public management and compliance with its legislative rulings , optimum conditions for freeing private initiative , a factor in economic and commercial progress .  
This has served ( a ) as a driving force for a better division of system-wide efforts , as evidenced by the subject-matter focus of the three task forces ; ( b ) as an enabling mechanism for integrated country-level action ; and ( c ) as a vehicle for critical new input on complex development issues , as evidenced by the Secretary-General 's Africa regional-level initiative on agreed development objectives and the United Nations system-wide approach to the HIV / AIDS pandemic . 
Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , 2 / in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
For example , ITTO 's Guidelines and Criteria , covers forests of ITTO producer countries in all tropical regions ; the Montreal Process encompasses the temperate and boreal zone forests outside Europe in both the northern and southern hemispheres ; the Tarapoto Proposal includes humid tropical , tidal and riverine forests in the Amazon basin ; and the recent UNEP / FAO Dry-Zone Sub-Saharan Africa initiative covers the arid , semi-arid and dry sub-humid-zone forests and woodlands .  
Agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and in this context , the proposal of the Government of Norway to host a meeting in 1996 among interested countries and representatives of relevant international institutions , with a view to considering how the 20 / 20 initiative can be applied operationally , is welcomed ;  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
Taking into consideration the will of the Central American Presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America " 6 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a redefining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
It is also expected that regional follow-up will be discussed during the consultative meetings of the regional representatives of ACC members , following the initiative of the Secretary-General , who has requested the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to convene such meetings in order to facilitate a dialogue on the requirements and conditions for improved coordination at the regional level .  
The objective of the initiative undertaken by the Netherlands and Switzerland is to facilitate dialogue and exchange experiences regarding national needs assessment as a supporting tool for the improved utilization of environmentally sound technologies in the transition towards sustainable development , in particular in developing countries and in countries in economic transition .  17 / 1996 / 1 .  
Four main developments are addressed here : ( a ) the programmatic reports of the Secretary-General on an Agenda for Peace and an Agenda for Development ; ( b ) the cycle of international conferences on pressing issues and their outcome before the international community ; ( c ) the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and related activities ; and ( d ) the Secretary-General 's initiative to launch The United Nations Blue Book Series , documenting the active role and the legacy of the United Nations in resolving major issues .  
The meeting reviewed strategies and modalities for how universal access to basic social services can be pursued through concerted national and international action based on the 20 / 20 initiative .  
The main focus of the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable segments of the populations .  
Within the context of this 20 / 20 initiative , the meeting understood basic social services as comprising basic education and primary health care , including reproductive health and population programmes , nutrition programmes and safe drinking water and sanitation , as well as the institutional capacity for delivering those services .

Since the launching of that initiative three years earlier , only a few countries had been given HIPC packages , which had proved to be a mixed blessing because the structural adjustment policies required of those countries had been detrimental to the very people whom debt relief had been intended to help .  
The initiative was the Equalitarian Parliament , a two-day event in the National Parliament , and within the context of the European Campaign for the European Parliaments elections , that gathered female and male deputies of the current legislature and of the prior one , in equal numbers , and discussed this matter in terms of citizenship and democratic rights .

Large-scale interregional projects are currently being implemented on the initiative of and with direct participation by Turkmenistan in the energy , transport and communication sectors with a view to giving impetus to the accelerated economic development of the countries of the region and narrowing the technology gap between developed and developing and industrial and agrarian States .  
In this context , Turkmenistans initiative for the drafting and adoption of an international convention to guarantee the security and unimpeded transit of crude energy resources via major inter-State pipelines which are of enormous value to humankind and will carry the lifeblood for global economic development in the twenty-first century merits broad international support .

In future regional wars , our strong adversaries who possess high-tech weaponry may engage us in aerial battles with their superior technology .  These battles will be abrupt and decisive .  Our adversaries will go all out to seize the initiative by taking full advantage of nighttime and complex weather conditions .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
While people were sighing in despair , the special administration region government took drastic measures on its own initiative to strengthen the linked exchange rate system , drove international speculators out of Hong Kong , and stabilized the securities market and financial market , thus proving the pessimistic predictions of some people to be untrue .  
Therefore , the unit , relying on its own efforts in the face of these difficulties , took the initiative in carrying out coordinated training with a transportation regiment of the military region , a helicopter wing , and a naval test base under the support of the military region 's relevant department .  For the first time in the entire armed forces , it conducted a long-distance three-dimensional maneuver for its troops by four transportation methods - - " sea routes , air links , railways , and highways " .  The maneuver was a success .  
The competition of comprehensive national strength in the 21st century is , in the final analysis , the competition of the quality of people and talent .  Social science plays a very important and irreplaceable role in developing people 's wisdom , cultivating talent with both ability and political integrity , arousing people 's initiative and creativeness , and strengthening the rallying power of people of the whole country .  
At the Central Committee Ideological and Political Work Conference , Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized that , in the face of the new circumstances and new situation , ideological and political work must make efforts to carry out innovation and improvement on a foundation of carrying on and developing superior traditions and in such areas as content , form , method , means , and mechanisms .  In particular , he stressed , efforts must be made to heighten the sense of the times and strengthen direction , effectiveness , and initiative .  
It has upheld singing out the principal melody , successfully fought the battle of initiative , grasped the important issues , taken education and trust in ideals as the core , strongly propagated patriotism , collectivism , and socialism , deeply implemented the Party 's fundamental theory , its basic line , its basic education on guiding principles , established a correct world view , outlook on life , and value judgments .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
Over the last 20 years or so , the broad masses of the people have emancipated their minds and acted on an unprecedented historical initiative and proceeded from a highly developed sense of responsibility for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to offer ideas and contribute methods for the reform and opening up and undertakings of modernization drive and actively study new situations and resolve new issues in the light of the actual conditions .  
In accordance with its peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , China did not draw ideological lines but respected the political system which these countries had chosen , rapidly extended diplomatic recognition to those states which emerged as independent from the former Soviet Union , and established diplomatic relations with them .  
At the central conference on ideological and political work , Chairman Jiang clearly pointed out : " On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions , we must strive to innovate in and improve the contents , forms , methods , means , mechanisms , and other aspects of our ideological and political work ; we must especially increase the purposefulness and practical results of this work and enhance our initiative in this regard .  
strengthen basic research and applied basic research , focus our attention on making breakthroughs in such aspects as information technology , biotechnology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing technology , and aeronautic and aerospace technology , and enhance the capability of making innovations on our own initiative in certain high-tech spheres that have a bearing on the nation 's economic lifeline and security .  
At all times and in all situations , the banner of the Party should treated as the one banner , initiative must be taken in assuming the task of carrying out the Party 's Central Committee 's and Military Commission 's instructions and directives , a perfect mastery of the political issues in the General Political Department and units directly under its supervision is ensured , and a correct line of guidance for political work of the armed forces is ensured .  
To increase the quick response capacity and the capacity to gain the initiative by striking first by the destroyers , the technical personnel of the squadron have boldly reformed the traditional methods for checking missiles before they are launched .  They have invented a way to check missiles quickly and to optimize the checking procedures without changing the technical performance of missiles .  This has greatly increased the response capacity of the system of multi-series vessel missiles and has ensured " launching missiles before the enemy . "  
Not only has it been innovative in adopting new ideological concepts and modes of thinking in carrying out its domestic construction , it has also changed the isolationism of its past foreign policy , enthusiastically taking the initiative in developing relations with various countries .  
Developing a good system and social environment conducive to bringing into play the initiative and creativity of scientific and technological personnel is a major pressing strategic task .  We must step up the reform of the scientific personnel system , take additional steps to formulate and perfect all kinds of encouragement policies and measures .  
Faced with the extremely sharp and complicated international struggle , in the past 10-plus years , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core judged the hour and sized up the situation , took the initiative , maneuvered among various states , and defeated western hostile forces ' attempts to disturb us .  Under the leadership of the CPC , a socialist China , with a strong posture , is standing in the east of the world .  
Deputy Ren Shimao , Secretary of the Huangshi municipal party committee , noted : those enterprises that intend to go abroad must upgrade their business management concepts , which include : taking the initiative in striking out on the international market , being prepared for surviving and growing amid fair competition in the international and domestic markets , attaching great importance to information collection both at home and abroad , and respecting others ' intellectual property rights while safeguarding ours . 
The fact that under the staunch leadership of the party , the anti-separatist struggle in our region has turned from the state of passively meeting an emergency to one of taking the initiative to tackle problems in a comprehensive way and that our social and political situation remains stable shows that the 2.6-million people of all ethnic groups , the main body in the struggle against the separatist clique headed by the Dalai , are carrying out this struggle with strong determination , redoubled confidence , and high morale until they win a complete victory .  
They upheld selecting the best of the best to correctly select and assign capable commanding officers for brigades and regiments , adopted various patterns to strengthen the training for the leading organs of brigades and regiments , implemented patterns like armies and divisions working together , members of party standing committees having division of labor , and so on to examine and assist the building of brigades and regiments one by one , and unfolded the activities of appraising through comparison the advanced brigades and regiments to fully mobilize the initiative and creativity of brigades and regiments .  
But it still goes back to the same old question , that is , without the initiative of civil society , without the basis of full-scale economic division and full-scale division of social interests , and without the existence of a lenient and compromising political culture that is organically associated with such division of the socio-economic structure , it will end up with the same predicament of " quasi-multiparty system " in the early ROC years if what we have is merely the aspiration for the superficial efficacy of multiparty system .  
The gearing effect of improving and developing its relations with the United States will not only enable India to gain more strategic initiative in dealing with the other big powers and create an international and peripheral security environment to its own advantage , but it will all the more give impetus to India to make a big step forward to the world political and diplomatic arena .  
Hence , in the drive to " strike hard " and put things in order , it is necessary to make full preparations to consistently regard as the most important thing the crackdown on organized crime , especially organized crime of all kinds committed by backbone ethnic separatist elements , elements who commit bombing and terrorism , and extremist religious elements ; we must take the initiative to attack them , and hit them as soon as they show themselves .  
Speaking of China 's foreign policies , President Jiang stressed : Maintaining independence and keeping the initiative are the most salient characteristics of China 's diplomacy .  On various international issues , China has all along formulated her policies or positions by constantly proceeding from the fundamental , long-term interests of the Chinese people and the people the world over , and in light of right and wrong in specific issues as well .  
The Supreme People 's Procuratorate urges procuratorial and public security organs throughout the country to incorporate the special operation into the unified plans for the nationwide " strike-hard " campaign , and to continue to intensify efforts on the pursuit and arrest work .  It is necessary to truly implement the state 's criminal law and policy by honoring the policy of leniency for suspects who voluntarily surrender to the authority and who take the initiative to return illicit money .  
They should also emulate Wang Wei 's lofty ideological character of making selfless dedication , loving and respecting his work , disregarding personal gains and loses , and being indifferent to fame and profit so that they will be able to take the initiative to subordinate themselves to and serve the cardinal needs of reform and construction , cultivate a fine moral character , establish a lofty goal of life , and maintain the unchangeable integrity of revolutionary military personnel .  
Especially at a time when the country is engaged in launching the important reform projects of building a socialist market economic system and restructuring the financial and tax policies , the ministry has taken the initiative in supporting and guiding Tibet 's financial reforms in accordance with Tibet 's actual situation .  
We must , with a strong sense of historic mission , actively plunge into the great practice of socialist modernization , and fully display our initiative and creativity to fulfill the key tasks in our country 's development in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan , and promote the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of the national economy .  
The judicial administrative departments and all police officers and public security cadres must seriously study the spirit of the work conference , take the initiative in plunging into the hard-striking anti-crime struggle and various tasks for the comprehensive maintenance of law and order , and make contributions to achieving the objective of markedly improving the law-and-order situation within two years as required by the central leadership .  
It should be emphasized that the " five breakthroughs and one enhancement " form an integral whole .  Inherent close links exist among the major tasks involved and between the major tasks and other tasks .  To emphasize the integrity of the trade union work is to emphasize the unity and inherent link between the protection and the development of initiative of workers and staff members .  
In order to gain the initiative in maneuver operations at night , this regiment actively organized pilots to conduct night maneuvers at unfamiliar airports , aviation routes , airspace and environment ; laid ambushes ; and made long-distance raids and carried out other difficult training subjects in an effort to vigorously improve the quality of flights as well as the organizational planning and command coordination ability of commanders , and tempered their mentality , technology , and other comprehensive qualities .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .  This will aid in protecting and advancing peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region as well as in the world .  No matter how military planning is strengthened , advocacy of containment of China is contrary to the historical trend and is entirely wrong and will get nowhere .  
Raidi , chairman of the Tibet regional people 's congress standing committee , said : Currently Tibet is in the best period in history .  Tibet has been enjoying social progress , economic prosperity , and ethnic unity ; frontier defense in Tibet is ensured ; people of Tibet have been living and working in peace and contentment ; and the anti-splittism struggle has developed from being in a passive position and taking measures to cope with emergencies to taking the initiative to deal with things .  These achievements have not come by easily .  
Economically , the relationship of production characterized by the monopoly of the three major estate-holders was abolished , and ownership by individual farmers and herdsmen was established .  The vast number of former serfs and slaves began to possess their own land , sheep , cattle , and means of production .  This greatly aroused their initiative for production and emancipated the productive forces .  
Particularly since the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , the region has taken the initiative in launching offensive and sought both a permanent cure and a temporary solution to the separatist problem .  The in-depth anti-separatist struggle in the political , ideological , educational , and cultural fields has dealt a crashing blow to all kinds of separatist activities , reversed the passive situation , and retaken the initiative .  As a result , basic stability of Tibet 's social and political situation has been maintained for a fairly long period .  
Only evaluating " horses " will be tantamount to give the power of initiative on personnel training to history , making the difficult process of personnel training a process of living or dying without external interference .  When there is an urgent need , there will be shortages of needed personnel , and it then becomes necessary to pick the taller ones among short people .  
We should accurately determine and promptly adjust the stress of preventing job-related crimes according to the party and state 's major measures and strategic plans for reform and development in the period , the situation in the occurrence of cases and crimes , social hot spots , problems about which the masses complain strongly , and symptomatic and tendentious issues ; we should find the right places to penetrate and open a breach in work , open work fields , strengthen our initiative in work , and achieve better actual results .  
Your distinguished nation has pursued a foreign policy of maintaining independence and keeping initiative in one 's own hands , has protected world peace and promoted joint progress , and has played an increasingly important role in international and regional affairs .  
All relevant troops , academies , and scientific research units have taken the initiative to contact the stationed areas , understand the technological items urgently needed in local construction , and organize all forces and spare no efforts to engage in research and development of the items .  As a result , some major technological difficulties encountered in implementing the key state , provincial , and city engineering projects in the western area have been resolved .  
As far as capital - and technology-intensive industries are concerned , therefore , if they only look inward , they are bound to be hit hard by China 's accession to WTO and may even collapse .  But if they seize the initiative to set up joint ventures with foreign investors and put foreign funds , technology , and management to use , they will put themselves in an invincible position .  
For example , they are in favor of safeguarding and abiding by the 1992 " Anti-Ballistic Treaty " that forms the cornerstone for strategic stability and the foundation for the reduction of strategic offensive weapons , and are opposed to the deployment of closed theater missile defense systems by blocs of countries in the Asia-Pacific region .  They also support the initiative to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Asia , and support the efforts of and leading role played by the United Nations in the settlement of conflicts in Afghanistan and other issues .  
It is necessary to further understand that safeguarding workers ' legitimate rights and interests is the basic function and basic working channel for a trade union .  The trade unions should strive to properly protect and mobilize and guide the initiative and creativity of the vast mass of workers , and through various forms of mass economic and technical activities , organize and guide such initiative and creativity to serve the purpose of fulfilling various tasks set forth by the party and the government .  
We have taken the initiative in participating in multi-lateral and bilateral economic and trade cooperation , played an active and important role in the APEC and other international economic and trade organizations , and entered the final stage of negotiations on accession to the WTO .  
Marxism-Leninism and its creative development in China have fundamentally enhanced the spirit of the Chinese nation , greatly strengthened the historical initiative of the Chinese communists and the Chinese people to push forward China 's social development and make the great cause of ours to constantly forge ahead toward the lofty objectives along with the steps of the times .  
To raise the ideological and ethical standards and scientific and cultural levels of the workers , peasants , intellectuals , and other laboring people and the entire population and improve their work skills and creativity and give full scope to their enthusiasm , initiative , and creative power - - these should remain the tasks of primary importance that our party should perform in representing China 's advanced productive forces .  
To always represent the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people , our party must , in all kinds of work including party 's theory , line , program , principle and policy , persevere in taking the fundamental interests of the people as the starting point and ultimate goal , bring into full play people 's enthusiasm , initiative and creativity , and enable the people to constantly obtain tangible economic , political and cultural benefits through continuous social development and progress .

We should do so by starting with leaders in various financial institutions .  We should uphold healthy trends , develop new practices , enhance institutional initiative and creativity , and carry out to the letter , the decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council . We should make fresh , and greater contributions , through pushing forward a financial reform , rectifying financial order , stepping up financial supervision and control , and heightening operational efficiency , and should guard against and alleviate financial risks , and support national economic development as well .  
Launching a psychological offensive in conjunction with military action and breaking down the enemies ' morale through applying psychological pressure that leads to their defeat and to the seizing of the initiative in a war has been a favorite method embraced by both Chinese and foreign military thinkers both ancient and modern times .  
After this case took place , 100,000 people in Okinawa held a large-scale demonstration , calling for revising the unequal status of forces agreement .  But , Japan and the United States only revised the detailed rules for implementing the agreement and set forth that the US side may give " sympathetic consideration to Japan 's requirements " before hearing major cases , such as rape and murder .  However , as a matter of fact , the US side still gains the initiative .  
In order to ensure the educational activities of studying " three represents " at the level of villages to develop in a healthy manner , all counties should proceed from the different situations of economic development levels , organizations at village levels , and contingents of cadres to select several villages for making earnest experiments .  And every province should also directly run several experimental villages to explore and accumulate experiences , so as to master the initiative in providing work guidance .  
Zhang Qiyue said , as everyone knows , China practices a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and its military expenditure has always been at a low level among major world powers .  
We should study the new phenomenon that corruption breeds and becomes rampant during the period of economic structural change and rapid economic growth .  We should further define our thinking and policy , based on the analysis and study , for the case handling work under the new circumstances .  Only in this way can we firmly keep the initiative in our hands during the anti-corruption struggle and punish corruption in a more forceful and effective way .  
Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the vast number of intellectuals has demonstrated their unprecedented initiative and creativity .  Scientists and technical experts , taking aim at the world 's cutting-edge technologies , are working with daring in scaling the heights of science and technology ; and they have achieved great successes in developing proprietary high technologies , which are close to or have reached the world 's advanced levels .

In respect of science , education , and qualified personnel , it is necessary to strengthen compulsory and elementary education , make a breakthrough in developing high-tech projects , import qualified personnel from other regions and , at the same time , train local talented personnel , bringing into full play the initiative of the existing talent .  
In a modern war where the use of force sees no bounds , the weak are still nations outside of the West , because the Western nations so far are in control of the initiative for technological and scientific advancements and the resulting military advantages .  In a war where the two opposite sides have no rules but make massacre their ultimate goal , the victor will still be the side with technology and material superiority .  
The top level in Beijing believes that peaceful reunification must be guaranteed by powerful military force and correct strategic design , otherwise , the initiative in cross-strait relations will be lost .

Of equal importance is the fact that we must use practical and effective measures to deal with the Taiwan authorities in international " human rights above sovereignty " activities .  In particular , regarding the activities they carry out in western countries , we must have a plan for response , we must take initiative , and we must have a definite scope and counterpoint .  
If we do not speed up development of China 's economic and scientific and technological undertakings and work hard to narrow the gap with advanced global levels , we will have a difficult time taking hold of initiative in the fierce international competition .

Their unremitting efforts and correct decisions have eventually been crowned with the historical summit .  
We should build a corps of high-quality cadres who should be politically firm and who are able to cope with all kinds of dangers and are skillful in dealing with complicated situations .

The first - generation party leadership launched the land revolution , which stimulated the initiative and creativity of the millions of peasants to a tremendous extent , smoothly completed the socialist transformation of agriculture and traditional industry , and laid the firm foundation for the initial stage of socialism .  
The broad masses of transferred military cadres , on the other hand , should preserve and carry forward the fine tradition of the people 's army , serve the interests of the whole , support the reform program , and show understanding and sympathy for the difficulties experienced by the state and local authorities in trying to settle them .

The party 's leading members of the third generation with Jiang Zemin at the core have taken Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guidance , once again demonstrated the grand breadth of commanding the view from high above and taking the overall situation into consideration , made a correct assessment and analyzed the situation in a calm manner , followed a correct policy , and firmly grasped the initiative in economic work amid the turbulent and complicated economic situation at home and abroad .  
To make development , it is necessary to further break through various institutional and functional obstacles through reforms and further emancipate the productive forces and arouse the people 's initiative and creativity and stimulate the dynamism of our society .  Without reform , it would be hard to further advance economic development and structural readjustments .  
Safeguarding the authority of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is our most cardinal political principle and discipline and represents the basic interests of the state , the nation , and the broad masses of people .  All officers and men of the PLA must have a highly unified thinking , maintain a very firm attitude , and act on their own initiative .  
In his speech , Deputy Wang Ke said : In doing the PLA 's logistic work , we must take the initiative to serve the needs of overall national economic construction .  At all times , we must maintain our fine traditions of hard struggle and building the army through diligence and thrift and must make a real effort to successfully manage and make good use of our limited money .  
This will require the enterprises to form , as soon as possible , flexible and effective mechanisms for stimulating their initiative and motivation to develop new technologies and make technological innovations that will win them a favorable position in the competition .  First of all , a breakthrough should be made in the distribution system and the employment system .  Effective incentive mechanisms should be set up to attract talented people to the state-owned enterprises for making technological innovations .  
The system of leading cadres taking the blame and resigning should be comprehensively introduced .  Those leading cadres who are directly responsible for major cases of law or discipline violation should not only be given appropriate disciplinary penalties , but also offer to resign on their own initiative .  If such a person fails to tender his resignation himself , it is suggested that the people 's congress at the same level and its standing committee should dismiss or replace him .  
deepen reforms , expand opening-up , strive to make the two fundamental changes , take the initiative in advancing in the front of institutional and technological innovations , actively make use of both domestic and overseas resources , open up both domestic and international markets , gather momentum and vigor of sustained development ;  
In accordance with the unified plans of the central authorities regarding the launching in the rural areas of in-depth educational activities based on the important " three represents " idea , we must organize grass-roots cadres in studying and understanding the central authorities ' policies concerning the reduction of the burden on peasants , enhance their policy awareness and legal mindedness , improve their work style , and boost their initiative in implementing the policies .  
Further expanding domestic demand will make it possible for us to have the initiative in our hands in developing the economy and maintaining sustained and steady economic growth , and this is also a strategic move in smoothly carry out the 10th Five-Year Plan and fulfilling the third-step development objective .  
The spokesman stressed that the scheme is not another type of care and attention home for the elderly but a specific housing initiative with integrated domestic and supportive components to enable the elderly to ' age in place ' and enjoy ' healthy ageing . ' "  
The InterPARES is a new international research initiative aiming at developing theoretical and methodological knowledge required for the permanent preservation of authentic records created in electronic systems .  
The language benchmark initiative arose from the Education Commission Report No . 6 , published in 1996 after two rounds of public consultation , which recognised the urgent need in Hong Kong to enhance the proficiency of Chinese ( including Putonghua ) and English of young people in order to meet changing political , economic , social and cultural demands . 
I am pleased to note that some Hong Kong lawyers have taken the initiative to develop a better understanding of the Mainland 's legal system .  It is being done with a view to ensuring that issues affecting both jurisdictions will be handled properly , all the while protecting the integrity of Hong Kong 's separate legal and judicial systems .  
Over 1,400 frail elders will receive enhanced home and community care services under a new initiative to be implemented next month ( March 2001 ) .  These elders are assessed to be of moderate level of impairment .  They need appropriate support in home help , personal care and nursing and allied health services so that they may continue to live at home .  Support will also be rendered to family members who care for their elders .  
The avant-garde artists , on their own initiative , grouped in 1912 in the " Section d'or " exhibition held at the La Boetie , wanted to collectively show their works , which were proclaimed as " Cubist " , and mocked by the journalists and the general public , as a form of reply or as a defensive position .  The exhibition was chiefly seeking a common guiding aesthetic principle , to recreate the visual values of objects and forms .  
" We want the most capable people , those who are prepared to work hard , show initiative and leadership and are committed to Hong Kong 's future to apply for this stimulating and highly influential position , " Secretary for the Civil Service , Mr Joseph W P Wong , said .  
That is why in our education reforms , while continuing to make primary and secondary education even more widely available , while committing to improve the quality of our entire public school system , we have also put in place the important initiative to enhance the competitiveness of direct subsidy scheme schools , and to help more private schools to meet the diverse quality needs of different parents and students .  
" The Science and Technology subject is an initiative to provide students with a broad and balanced curriculum .  It is particularly valuable to non-science students , providing them with additional learning experiences on modern scientific and technological developments , " he explained .  
The land lots owned by HA account for about 73.3 per cent of the total amalgamated area .  Had the HA not taken the initiative to redevelop NPE , the potential of this prime site would not have been released for the benefit of the entire community .  The reason is that the public transport interchange and open space are earmarked as GIC and recreational use respectively in the outline zoning plan , rendering the present development potential of these two sites to be minimal .  
Speaking after the meeting , the Secretary for Commerce , Industry and Technology , Mr Henry Tang said : " We are glad that this private sector initiative is gaining momentum and continual support with the positive response from the international and local chambers of commerce as well as other business and professional bodies .  
" We appreciate the effort of the operating agencies , including non-government organisations and private operators , for taking initiative to freeze or reduce their fee charges .  Their act has demonstrated their commitment in running quality service while at the same time sharing jointly parents ' financial burden under this stagnant economic environment , " the spokesman said .  
Here 's something that makes for an interesting comparison : In the 1992 legislative elections , Chou Chuan , then still a member of the KMT , did n't obtain her party 's nomination , and she decided to run as an independent . According to Chou , there was a virtual media blackout about her campaign , until a cable system operator within her district took the initiative to broadcast a videotape of her describing her political views . Outsiders thus concluded that cable television played a great part in her election .  
Later on , the Puli Township public works bureau took the initiative to recruit scholars and relevant administrative agencies , holding the Puli High School Tamalin Ruins Investigative Conference , at which they decided a full-scale excavation ought to take place at the original test dig site . Up through the middle of April , the archaeological dig kept going .  
Perhaps the hardest thing to understand about these stories is how these elegant , genteel products of elite households , upon becoming ghosts , suddenly become audacious and passionate pursuers of love . They always take the initiative to strike up acquaintances and break the ice , volunteer themselves for passionate embraces , and have insatiable desire .  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
In addition , the author adopts a principle of " purposiveness " ( in which everything in life has some positive potential purpose ) , very akin to theology , to explain everything , and to persuade people of the wisdom of the definitive behavioral principles that can be expected to bring health and longevity . Individual initiative and moral responsibility are excluded completely .  
Professor Huang Ping-huang of the Department of Education at National Chengchi University ( NCCU ) also believes that initiative is the quality most lacking in today 's primary and middle school teachers : " They are so accustomed to eating instant noodles that they have forgotten how to cook . "  
Vice President Lu stressed that this initiative was undertaken in support of President Chen 's " go south " policy , aimed at opening up new horizons for Taiwanese business investment in Southeast Asia . Further , she expressed her gratitude to Indonesia 's ruling and opposition parties and to members of its private sector for extending their hand of friendship and courageously embracing Taiwan 's expressions of goodwill in defiance of a powerful country 's bullying bluster .  
In 1992 , Chiku Township began planning an industrial park in this area . Conservationists fought the initiative and eventually built a national consensus to " set aside a piece of pristine land for the black-faced spoonbills . " The birds ' nesting grounds were thus preserved , and scholars gradually began to get involved in research and conservation .  
Some months ago you ran a feature on digital content , and recently you also reported the development of nanotechnology in Taiwan . From these articles we can see how sensitive the government is to the development of new technologies , and how-whether by their own initiative or with government guidance-many large , medium and small enterprises are getting involved in R &amp; D or production related to these emerging technologies .  
This transformation is being pursued on the basis of new perceptions about development , which see in popular participation , individual and local initiative and private business activity the key to economic recovery and sustainable economic growth .  
On the contrary , a security system must be established that ensures the fiscal integrity of all persons , individual initiative and the inviolability of private property , through a stable monetary system and efficient public services .  
Notwithstanding the positive initiative taken by the major nuclear Powers since the end of the cold war , there is still a need to establish a close link between disarmament and international peace in the years ahead .  
The panel , balanced in its representation of members , would address this initiative in the light of the current international economic , administrative , regulatory environment .  
Despite the socioeconomic changes carried out in our States to stimulate private initiative and cooperative movements and to improve living conditions , the African continent is still experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis .  
The proposed initiative was designed to offer ways for the reasonable expression of plausible aspirations of that nature through free options ranging from limited and basic selfadministration to virtual internal selfgovernment .  
His Government had repeatedly expressed its opposition to that initiative because it clearly violated the most basic human rights of migrant workers and their families set forth in various international legal instruments .  
In addition , 74 supplementary reports containing additional information were received from the States parties , submitted either on the initiative of the States parties concerned or at the request of the Committee following its examination of their respective initial or periodic reports under the Convention .  
However , there is no doubt that progress towards a lasting , just and comprehensive peace is contingent on the continued , determined and coordinated efforts of the international community in the maintenance of a global approach to the current peace initiative and the continuation of the international sanctions against the Belgrade regime .  
Moreover , this initiative fell within a favourable context of human dimension and a framework of values and hopes that were largely shared by sovereign States and Governments linked by their use of the French language , which greatly helped the Agency first to be recognized internationally and then to grow .  
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
The Secretary-General , in his peacemaking initiative and in close consultation with the Security Council , sent to Tajikistan a small integrated United Nations unit of political , military and humanitarian officers to monitor the situation on the ground , provide liaison services and constitute a ground core for any possible more extensive United Nations participation in the regional efforts in Tajikistan in the future .  
These have been actively considered by UNDP within the broad framework of a strategic management initiative aimed at harmonizing three distinct components of UNDP programming : strategic planning - addressing its basic mission and strategies ; operational planning - focusing on means of achieving results ; and results management - analysing , through monitoring , review and evaluation , real performance against stated plans .  
It should be noted that , following a 1993 initiative of the World Bank , a growing number of financial institutions are meeting to discuss very practical affairs of common concern , such as procedures for assuring the environmental quality of projects and economic analysis of environmental projects .  
We cite in particular the call by the President of the Republic of Cyprus , Mr . Glafcos Clerides , who , during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Cyprus in October 1993 , urged the establishment of such a court and received a positive response by the other participants , who as is stated in the communiqu , " recognized that the successful culmination of this initiative could provide the international community with an important instrument against international crime " . 
There was great enthusiasm among the countries concerned for this major new initiative for South-South cooperation , which went beyond the objectives of the Caracas Programme of Action inasmuch as it sought , as the Group 's annual meetings progressed , to articulate at the level of heads of Government the economic problems faced by the South and to engage the North in a constructive dialogue .  
In support of the WH initiative and to meet needs identified in the field , a decentralized model of national participants , which includes information on types of teams ready for deployment and functional areas of expertise , could be envisaged as part of an overall roster system maintained by UNV in accordance with the parameters defined by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and UNV .  
While agreeing with the need for Headquarters to become more involved in validating the aircraft requirements of all missions , the Field Administration and Logistics Division stated that " since this recommendation would involve a major policy initiative , and would consequently entail a comprehensive review , we believe it more judicious to reserve our specific comments in this regard , pending the outcome of a complete evaluation " . 
The broad spectrum of activities of the countries covered above shows that the strategic planning initiative is not one specific blueprint but more of an agenda , an institutional vision which helps to direct , monitor and track performance to stated goals and objectives .  
The second model , the information initiative approach , requires a series of basic steps that generate high quality of information , which then can be utilized to identify ( a ) shortcomings in the current human resources capacities of the public sector ; ( b ) types of professional development programmes needed in order to upgrade the quality of the staff ; and ( c ) the knowledge and skills needed for those who will be recruited into the public sector .  
Regrettably , we must note that in Croatia the initial positive reaction to this initiative has been abandoned , and they have proved to be unprepared to begin a direct peaceful dialogue .  
To this end , we shall establish , based on the successful public / private sector Caribbean Coalition on Tourism Marketing Programme for North America , broad-based regional marketing programmes and joint representation in the major markets , including the intra-Caribbean market , on a sustainable basis , and develop , not later than the end of 1995 , a financing arrangement to sustain this initiative .  
At the initiative of Yugoslavia , a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries was held at Belgrade in February 1988 which laid down the foundations for the process of multilateral cooperation among the countries of the region and opened up perspectives for better understanding and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
At the second ministerial meeting of CBI in March 1994 , participating countries reaffirmed their commitment to the initiative and reported substantial progress with trade reform , particularly the elimination of trade licensing and other non-tariff barriers , liberalization of payments on the current account and in designing more liberal and transparent investment regimes .  
The decisive condition for their realization is the spontaneous initiative of individuals , first of all representatives of cultural and public life and of youth , with the financial assistance of national and international organizations and foundations .  
A special initiative entitled " Intensified cooperation with countries and peoples in greatest need " aims to enable poor countries to establish equitable and sustainable health systems tailored to their specific needs .  
NULLThe basic purpose of the proposed policy initiative would be to exploit to the maximum , and in a cost-effective manner , the savings and credit potential of the informal and semi-formal financial system ; to strengthen its ability to mobilize small savings from relatively marginal sections of population ; and to encourage decentralized lending , that is , in areas largely untouched by the formal financial system .  
NULLThe policy initiative should begin with national efforts to seek to determine the overall magnitude of operations and the role of the institutions in the informal sector , to understand how they work and how sets of unwritten rules and social conventions have guided and sustained them against risks inherent in financial transactions .  
The General Assembly has proclaimed 1998 to be the International Year of the Ocean . 158 / This initiative is expected to generate important cooperative efforts in the United Nations system 159 / and stimulate greater global awareness of the oceans and greater cooperation for the effective protection and management of marine and coastal areas and resources . 
An initiative put forward by the President of Russia , Mr . Yeltsin , has received broad international backing that is , the initiative on the holding in the spring of 1996 of a summit meeting on issues of nuclear security , to consider pressing problems in this area and define ways to solve them , in both the short and the long term .  
Regarding preparations at the national level , the Committee took note of the substantial progress achieved since the first substantive session , and further strengthened the best practices initiative on improving the living environment by further refining the criteria for nomination and the format for reporting on best practices .  
Taking into consideration the will of the Central American presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for Sustainable Development " 4 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a re-defining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
pointed out that the resolution mentioned above had been adopted on an initiative of the Sudan , motivated by its concern for the situation of more than 20,000 children who had been sequestered by the insurgent movement in the south of the country , which used them as explosives carriers , human shields in minefields and as a military reserve , a situation which was intolerable since it violated religious and humane principles .  
into consideration the will of the Central American presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for Sustainable Development " 4 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a re-defining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
also the initiative by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of establishing a pilot project of the Humanitarian Early Warning System , with the purpose of identifying potential crises with humanitarian implications through the analysis of its database , and welcoming further the establishment by the Department of Political Affairs , the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of interdepartmental consultations for the joint analysis of early warning of looming crises , within a broader framework for the coordination of operational planning and implementation among the three departments ,  
programme had been mentioned in two General Assembly resolutions , resolutions 48 / 132 and 49 / 194 , and represented not only an initiative designed to help Member States to build and strengthen their national capacities , but also an aspect of international action in the field of human rights which deserved recognition as being equal in importance to the monitoring mechanisms . 
However , if and when the financial target of the 20 / 20 initiative is attained , and even if more donors reach or surpass the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance , as the Netherlands did long ago , it will only have the hoped-for effect if there is a sufficiently competent and honest government machinery to administer these important funds .  
This set of realities has led Algeria , committed as it is to a vast process of economic reform , to formulate and implement a development strategy which , while subjecting the economy to the laws of the marketplace , will ensure the necessary balance between the various State functions , tying the powers of the public authorities in the coordination of economic activity to the desire to preserve to the greatest extent possible a patrimony that has been built up through the colossal efforts of our national community , while encouraging free enterprise and private initiative .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
Moreover , Greece has supported all international initiatives aimed at further promoting Balkan regional cooperation , such as the conference of ministers of southeastern Europe which convened this year in Sofia and which will meet again in Thessaloniki in June of next year the European Royaumont initiative and the United States southeast European cooperative initiative .  
The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
Working with partners in 18 countries , USAID is undertaking a learning process designed to explore and document new ways to build capacity and linkages among groups at the local level ; to forge solid society-to-society linkages between these local groups and their United States counterparts ; and to foster a legal , regulatory and fiscal environment conducive to citizen participation and community initiative .  
In this connection , it is pertinent to mention the recent meeting held in Oslo in April 1996 on the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , according to which interested developed - and developing-country partners will allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
In its review of Agenda 21 the special session should lay the grounds for further international cooperation , national and regional initiative , and the mobilization of resources for meeting the sustainable development needs of small island developing States .  
Since this initiative came to the General Assembly for the first time as a result of Nicaragua 's urgent needs in 1990 at the end of its decade-long armed conflict and of its starting on the path to democracy and economic and social development , we have seen emergency assistance to be a temporary but very effective mechanism to help resolve the difficult problems of transition .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa , adopted by the General Assembly in 1991 , was a good initiative aimed at giving the international community the opportunity to review the deteriorating economic and social conditions on the African continent with a view to finding the proper solutions for them and to renewing the commitment to support Africa 's efforts to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development .  
We are confident that the same initiative , determination and courage that the parties demonstrated in forging a historical framework for the peace and stability of the region can likewise be invoked to pave a new avenue built upon cooperation and coexistence that will eventually lead to a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region based on Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967 ) , 338 ( 1973 ) and 425 ( 1978 ) .  
Each nation is responsible for itself and must create , through rigorous public management and compliance with its legislative rulings , optimum conditions for freeing private initiative , a factor in economic and commercial progress .  
This has served ( a ) as a driving force for a better division of system-wide efforts , as evidenced by the subject-matter focus of the three task forces ; ( b ) as an enabling mechanism for integrated country-level action ; and ( c ) as a vehicle for critical new input on complex development issues , as evidenced by the Secretary-General 's Africa regional-level initiative on agreed development objectives and the United Nations system-wide approach to the HIV / AIDS pandemic . 
Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , 2 / in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
For example , ITTO 's Guidelines and Criteria , covers forests of ITTO producer countries in all tropical regions ; the Montreal Process encompasses the temperate and boreal zone forests outside Europe in both the northern and southern hemispheres ; the Tarapoto Proposal includes humid tropical , tidal and riverine forests in the Amazon basin ; and the recent UNEP / FAO Dry-Zone Sub-Saharan Africa initiative covers the arid , semi-arid and dry sub-humid-zone forests and woodlands .  
Agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and in this context , the proposal of the Government of Norway to host a meeting in 1996 among interested countries and representatives of relevant international institutions , with a view to considering how the 20 / 20 initiative can be applied operationally , is welcomed ;  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
Taking into consideration the will of the Central American Presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America " 6 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a redefining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
It is also expected that regional follow-up will be discussed during the consultative meetings of the regional representatives of ACC members , following the initiative of the Secretary-General , who has requested the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to convene such meetings in order to facilitate a dialogue on the requirements and conditions for improved coordination at the regional level .  
The objective of the initiative undertaken by the Netherlands and Switzerland is to facilitate dialogue and exchange experiences regarding national needs assessment as a supporting tool for the improved utilization of environmentally sound technologies in the transition towards sustainable development , in particular in developing countries and in countries in economic transition .  17 / 1996 / 1 .  
Four main developments are addressed here : ( a ) the programmatic reports of the Secretary-General on an Agenda for Peace and an Agenda for Development ; ( b ) the cycle of international conferences on pressing issues and their outcome before the international community ; ( c ) the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and related activities ; and ( d ) the Secretary-General 's initiative to launch The United Nations Blue Book Series , documenting the active role and the legacy of the United Nations in resolving major issues .  
The meeting reviewed strategies and modalities for how universal access to basic social services can be pursued through concerted national and international action based on the 20 / 20 initiative .  
The main focus of the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable segments of the populations .  
Within the context of this 20 / 20 initiative , the meeting understood basic social services as comprising basic education and primary health care , including reproductive health and population programmes , nutrition programmes and safe drinking water and sanitation , as well as the institutional capacity for delivering those services .  
The Moroccan delegation 's initiative sought to impose a singular , selective , partisan and tendentious interpretation of the reports of the Secretary-General and to accept it would have set an unfortunate and dangerous precedent .  
Undertake a far-reaching and comprehensive initiative which includes : ( i ) suspending the excessive granting to individuals of licences to carry firearms while measures aimed at severely restricting such activity are being enacted ; ( ii ) stepping up the efforts to impede the illegal flow of arms across the borders ; and ( iii ) issuing strict instructions to monitor the weapons of disbanded and inactive voluntary civil defence committees so as to prevent their transfer to similar organizations ;  
UNDP has supported a Central American initiative to establish a Central American Network for Democratic Governance , which would act as an internal regional mechanism for dialogue and concerted action and would also help to identify weaknesses in the functioning of the Government which might be responsive to specific training activities ;  
Cooperatively structured community enterprises are an effective organizational means whereby grass-roots initiative and both public and private funds can be combined in order to revitalize disadvantaged communities without creating dependency .  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
In Costa Rica , it has assisted in the promotion of a national policy for the training of local administrators , specifically in financial management , as well as facilitating the creation of a Metropolitan Council for the City of San Jos ; and has supported the " State of the Nation " initiative , consisting of a participatory scheme to produce an annual report of the country 's sustainable human development performance and its most significant challenges . 
Under the new initiative it would be determined after the initial three-year period whether Naples terms , together with comparable relief by non-Paris Club bilateral donors and commercial creditors , would be sufficient to put the country in a sustainable debt-service position .  
It is patently clear - and accepted throughout the developing world - that functioning markets and private initiative are among the most efficient and powerful mechanisms to generate wealth and thus permit increased standards of living .  
His delegation welcomed the recent initiative to tackle the problem of multilateral debt and to enhance rescheduling by the Paris Club ; however , the approach must be broadened , bearing in mind the requirements of economic growth and social and environmental sector investments .  There was still a pressing need to find an early and lasting solution to all types of debt which also took into account the problems and requirements of individual countries .  
In a statement of 23 April 1996 on the situation of human rights in Colombia , the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to proceed , upon the initiative of the Government of Colombia and the identification of adequate sources of financing , to establish at the earliest possible date a permanent office in Colombia to assist the Colombian authorities in developing policies and programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights and to observe violations of human rights in the country , making analytical reports to the High Commissioner .  
In that regard , it was not clear whether the reform of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) that had been proposed by its Administrator focused on the level of resources or on the Programme 's efficiency , and he wondered whether that process would be reviewed by the Governing Council , and whether the Administrator 's initiative concerning the reform of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations was a personal initiative or was part of a review of the level of resources to be allocated to operational activities for development in future .  
It was in its endeavour to take up the challenge of providing these people with their basic minimum energy needs that the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , in a broad-based partnership with the United Nations and its specialized agencies , international organizations and concerned governmental and non-governmental organizations , launched in 1993 a global initiative : a three-year-long communication process known as the World Solar Summit Process .  
The Expert Group emphasized the importance of the IMF initiative for improving the reliability , comparability and credibility of economic information worldwide , noting that national statistical offices would be responsible for its implementation .  
In conclusion , he urged all Parties to encourage the establishment or strengthening of national climate committees , as well as national and regional action plans for climate change , in support of the Climate Agenda , an inter-agency initiative to establish an integrated framework for international climate-related scientific and technical programmes , and reaffirmed WMO 's strong commitment to fully support the Convention and its implementation process . implemented jointly . 
It endorsed the Secretary-General 's initiative to convene a Special Consultative Meeting of entities involved with the carriage of materials subject to the 1993 INF Code and the coastal States concerned for the purpose of sharing information , concerns and ideas and to gain a better understanding of the safety and environmental aspects involved .  
Notes that the recent heavily indebted poor countries initiative represents a step towards assisting countries with substantial debt problems , while stressing the urgent need to ensure an expeditious , flexible , constructive and full implementation of the initiative that is in line with the need for comprehensive approaches ;  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Urges the developed countries to give the heavily indebted poor countries initiative the support it both needs and deserves and to further refine the initiative so that the required six-year performance period is reduced to one lasting a maximum of three years and the terms of eligibility to be used in qualifying countries do not introduce new conditionalities ;  
Stresses the need for the Secretary-General to monitor closely the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative on multilateral debts , so that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session is ably guided in its deliberations on the sub-item on the external debt crisis and development to be included in the provisional agenda of that session of the Assembly , under the item entitled " Macroeconomic policy questions " ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] / in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
With reference to the 20 / 20 initiative embodied in the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , it had been agreed that the initial target was 0.7 per cent of gross national product , and that the ability of the Government of a developing country to devote 20 per cent of its expenditure to basic social services would depend on the level of economic development , its debt burden and other financial commitments .  
However , the initiative fell short of the expectations of the heavily indebted poor countries in three respects : the debt sustainability criteria were still restrictive ; appropriate flexibility was needed in determining country eligibility ; and a more realistic time _ frame for eligibility should be offered .  
Referring to the addendum to the LDCs 1996 Report , which addressed the important issue of strengthening the LDCs ' capacity for participation in the multilateral trading system and identified specific programmes that could ease the economic adjustment burden on the LDCs , he looked forward to a useful discussion on that issue and hoped that it would result in timely inputs to the initiative currently under way in the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) which would be submitted to the Singapore Ministerial Meeting .  
Notes that the recent heavily indebted poor countries initiative represents a step towards assisting countries with substantial debt problems , while stressing the urgent need to ensure an expeditious , flexible , constructive and full implementation of the initiative that is in line with the need for comprehensive approaches ;  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Urges the developed countries to give the heavily indebted poor countries initiative the support it both needs and deserves and to further refine the initiative so that the required six-year performance period is reduced to one lasting a maximum of three years and the terms of eligibility to be used in qualifying countries do not introduce new conditionalities ;  
Stresses the need for the Secretary-General to monitor closely the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative on multilateral debts , so that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session is ably guided in its deliberations on the sub-item on the external debt crisis and development to be included in the provisional agenda of that session of the Assembly , under the item entitled ' Macroeconomic policy questions ' ;

In order to provide enterprises with incentives to adopt innovative measures to promote female employment , a special award was established in 1993 at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour and Employment to reward those enterprises which have taken action to increase the participation of women in the labour force , improve the quality of female employment , develop their potential , including through the strengthening of programmes to provide education and vocational training , and eliminate or counteract the negative consequences in women 's work .  
Liechtenstein first introduced in 1991 an initiative on the right of self-determination , the ultimate goal of which is to enable States facing internal problems be they between the central Government and communities or between communities within States to cope with these problems in a peaceful and flexible manner on the basis of international law and through constructive dialogue .

The latest initiative to Judaize East Jerusalem with the building of a new Jewish settlement on Arab land in Jebel Abu Ghneim , in a highly symbolic place , is a deliberate provocation in the light of the relevant resolutions adopted by overwhelming majority of the international community at the two urgent meetings of the General Assembly and at its emergency special session .  
The revitalized regional integration initiative of Kenya , the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda , now called the East African Cooperation , provided expanded markets for local manufacturing output among member countries .  Also , the signing of a new trade protocol among the member countries of the Southern African Development Community has paved the way for expanded markets and increased trade among the Community 's member States , although regional manufacturing is increasingly dominated by South Africa .  
Statistics Canada 's globalization initiative was designed to meet that challenge , starting with the information required to understand how the various parts of a given firm fit together ; establish which of its parts are located in Canada ; deduce behaviour related to its condition ; and relate the firm 's performance to its new form of organization .  
A useful model for developing improved partnerships with non-governmental organizations is the PARinAC initiative of UNHCR , which emphasizes the formulation of common principles and goals and the creation of an umbrella framework for action and extensive consultative processes involving non-governmental organizations at the country , regional and international levels .

In the area of economic and social development , UNDP has focused on the formulation and implementation of a new initiative known as the Programme for the Promotion of Human Sustainable Development in Central America ( PROGRESS / CA ) , aiming at establishing regional , local and national consensus among the main social actors ( Governments , civil societies , international donors / NGOs and United Nations agencies ) on goals and actions towards human sustainable development .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
Therefore , with a view to contributing to international peace by tackling development issues in close cooperation with the United Nations , Japan has been taking the initiative for a new development strategy , which is to be based on the firm recognition of ownership of the countries involved , as well as a genuine partnership between them and industrialized countries .  
In Mozambique a major part of this initiative has involved a radio drama series in which Mozambican actors act out a lively series of plots conveying messages such as the importance of staying in school , how to deal with sexual harassment , AIDS-awareness , and covering delicate issues such as female genital mutilation , early marriages , and the domestic workload of girls .  
We also urge that an integrated initiative be agreed upon at that meeting on providing the least developed countries with coordinated and substantially increased technical cooperation in trade and trade-related areas with a view to strengthening their supply capacity of exportable goods and services , in line with the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures in Favour of the Least Developed Countries .

Indeed , with all of these trends and tendencies in the world economy , it was recognized by both developed and developing countries , States Members of the United Nations , that it was imperative to launch an endeavour of charting a framework of objectives and measures for national and international actions to address development more squarely and comprehensively than any other previous initiative undertaken by the United Nations .  
This initiative is designed to deal with the various facets of the grave phenomenon of arms proliferation , which besides draining vast resources that could be devoted to the social and economic development of our peoples constitutes the most dangerous threat to the peace and security of the world .  
The Secretary-General 's reform initiative is the most comprehensive attempt to date at fashioning the United Nations of tomorrow into an instrument capable of serving the common interests of all peoples , guided by the enduring tenets of peace , human rights , the rule of law and social progress , enshrined in the Charter more than half a century ago .  
The ministerial meeting of the Security Council devoted to Africa , held on the commendable initiative of the United States last 25 September , led to a fruitful exchange of views that showed us a real will on the part of the international community to become more actively , more significantly and more concretely involved in a new type of partnership with Africa in order to contribute to its development .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .

Egypt also supports the initiative launched by Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia and encourages full United Nations support for this newly born initiative , in the same manner as the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency supported the African States in the formulation of the Treaty of Pelindaba by assisting the Governments of the region and the Governments concerned to settle the remaining policy and technical issues , thus assisting in advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation .  
The World Summit for Social Development ( Copenhagen , 1995 ) and follow-up processes have recognized the priority of improving access and quality of basic social services in eradicating poverty .

In that context , the initiative of the IMF Interim Committee and the IMF Development Committee , which at their April 1996 meeting proposed a new framework of action to resolve the debt problems of poor heavily indebted countries , is a real breakthrough , because that initiative is based on a comprehensive approach to the solution of the debt problem that recognizes that all the main creditors ( bilateral and multilateral ) of a particular country should cooperate and coordinate their contributions to the alleviation of the recipient 's debt burden . 
One such initiative was the establishment of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples , which had recommended that aboriginal women should be specifically included in any process to define the powers of aboriginal governments and should be assured of full and equal participation in decision-making bodies responsible for developing and implementing measures to ensure their physical and emotional security .

On the initiative of the Government of Togo , the Central Organ of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution , meeting at the ministerial level during the sixty-fifth ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of OAU , held in Tripoli from 24 to 28 February 1997 , decided to hold in Lom a special session of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Central Organ in order to consider the situation in the Great Lakes region , with particular reference to eastern Zaire .  
The new emphasis was also prompted by the IMF Executive Boards request that staff pay particular attention to social indicators in the contexts of adjustment programmes supported by the IMFs enhanced structural adjustment facility and of the initiative to help heavily indebted poor countries achieve sustainable external debt positions . 
In particular , the disproportionate increase in multilateral debt , which is usually more difficult to service and can not be rescheduled , has intensified the problem of the debt overhang in the region and rendered the process of debt renegotiation more intractable , despite the latest initiative for the " highly indebted poor countries " .

Yet the attainment of a proper mix of distributive and redistributive policies is important , because private initiative , although crucial , is not sufficient for the achievement of an equitable and prosperous society .  
The initiative had been based on a strategy of a continuous regional cooperation among national universities in Central America and strong cooperation with astronomers and prestigious astronomical research centres at the international level .  
These institutions succeeded where traditional public programmes failed , and she supported UNCTADs initiative aimed at creating an essential direct link between private investors and micro finance institutions in developing countries .

Such perceptions of flaws in the existing Accord have led to pressure for regulatory changes , and underlie the new initiative of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision for its reform . 16 The approach now envisaged rests on three pillars : minimum capital requirements , supervisory review of capital adequacy in accordance with specified qualitative principles , and market discipline based on the provision of reliable and timely information ( discussed in paras . 10-11 above ) . 
The specific commitments from developing countries and the donor community to expand basic social services called for at the international meeting on the 20 / 20 initiative held at Hanoi were essential to realizing the goals set at Beijing and Cairo .  
A major development in relation to the HIPC initiative had been the Cologne debt initiative ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 44 ) , which linked debt relief to poverty reduction , and aimed at deepening and quickening debt reduction through a reduction in debt sustainability thresholds ; a deeper degree of cancellation ; interim relief ; floating completion points ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 46 ) ; and , as a result , an increase in the number of countries expected to be eligible for debt relief .  
As far as the external debt crisis was concerned , the Group of 77 and China welcomed the Cologne initiative and the enhanced HIPC framework which had been adopted at the recent annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and which held out the promise of faster , deeper and broader relief ; a critical factor to its success would be the provision of adequate financing .

Mr . Aleman ( Ecuador ) stressed the need for concerted action to solve the international financial crisis , and welcomed the Cologne debt initiative of the major industrialized countries as a sign of solidarity with countries like Ecuador , which had struggled with the impact of structural adjustment over the past several years .  
Since the launching of that initiative three years earlier , only a few countries had been given HIPC packages , which had proved to be a mixed blessing because the structural adjustment policies required of those countries had been detrimental to the very people whom debt relief had been intended to help .  
The initiative was the Equalitarian Parliament , a two-day event in the National Parliament , and within the context of the European Campaign for the European Parliaments elections , that gathered female and male deputies of the current legislature and of the prior one , in equal numbers , and discussed this matter in terms of citizenship and democratic rights .  
The current initiative , however , had alleviated only a small part of the debt of a limited number of countries and she therefore welcomed the progress achieved at the recent annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF to achieve dramatic cuts in the debt burden of the heavily indebted developing countries , linking those cuts to poverty reduction strategies .

Special mention should be made of our Bolivar 2000 plan , an initiative of the Presidency of the Republic to provide resources and professional and logistical capabilities from the armed forces to the population in order to establish an integrated social-service programme aimed , inter alia , at the provision of timely assistance to meet the peoples basic needs and at rehabilitating the social infrastructure .  
Today , as we look back , we can see that what we have achieved in Mongolia over the past decade in building the institutions of democracy , promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms , unleashing private initiative and developing our external relations has constituted a major advance towards a self-governing democratic society , a private-sector-led economy and a closer association with the rest of the international community .

The laudable initiative of convening a special session on the integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits should be continued on an annual basis ; debates should focus on themes agreed in the substantive session , taking into account the need to balance action and experience at the national level with the results and requirements of international cooperation .  
Within the context of the International Year of Mobilization against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , decided by the General Assembly , the High Commissioner should take the initiative of organizing important world cultural meetings , raising awareness , for example , among international sporting , musical and other artistic associations , universities , trade unions and national institutions .  
Similarly , ICLARM , whose operating mission is geared to research and capacity-building in natural resources management , fisheries stock assessment and aquaculture , assisted in a South South training initiative among a number of scientists from the developing world in quantitative genetics and its application to select breeding .

Large-scale interregional projects are currently being implemented on the initiative of and with direct participation by Turkmenistan in the energy , transport and communication sectors with a view to giving impetus to the accelerated economic development of the countries of the region and narrowing the technology gap between developed and developing and industrial and agrarian States .  
In this context , Turkmenistans initiative for the drafting and adoption of an international convention to guarantee the security and unimpeded transit of crude energy resources via major inter-State pipelines which are of enormous value to humankind and will carry the lifeblood for global economic development in the twenty-first century merits broad international support .
