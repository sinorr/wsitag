Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
The potential danger posed by the frequent passage of commercial vessels , and on occasion vessels carrying hazardous , toxic and radioactive wastes through the high seas surrounding a number of small island developing States , continues unattenuated .

Although the Special Rapporteur notes that there presently does not appear to exist an explicit or systematic government policy of encouraging summary executions , he is greatly concerned by the frequent allegations of arbitrary killings of civilians and insurgents by members of the Tatmadaw under a variety of circumstances , in violation of the right to life contained in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .

In illustration of a " top-down " method for estimating the impact of coercive economic measures , the expert group referred itself to a recent study that attempts to empirically measure the impact of sanctions on bilateral trade flows , particularly on exports by the United States which is the most frequent sender of unilateral sanctions . 36 But the method used , a common one in economics known as the " gravity model " , also captures the impact on the trade of the target country .

For that reason , we reiterate our grave concern at the increasingly frequent transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste through areas of the high seas close to our exclusive economic zone .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
The potential danger posed by the frequent passage of commercial vessels , and on occasion vessels carrying hazardous , toxic and radioactive wastes through the high seas surrounding a number of small island developing States , continues unattenuated .

Although the Special Rapporteur notes that there presently does not appear to exist an explicit or systematic government policy of encouraging summary executions , he is greatly concerned by the frequent allegations of arbitrary killings of civilians and insurgents by members of the Tatmadaw under a variety of circumstances , in violation of the right to life contained in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
