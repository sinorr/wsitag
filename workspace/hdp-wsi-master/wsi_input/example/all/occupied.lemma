If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country , and if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation , it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for " Taiwan independence " and safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
However , if a grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , or if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-Strait reunification through negotiations , then the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfill the great cause of reunification .  
At present , it is particularly necessary to effectively utilize and manage the internet , as it has become the fourth largest mass media next to newspapers , radio , and television .

( b ) As compared with the forecast made early this year , the foundation remedial works for Block L of Tin Chung Court are expected to experience a slight slippage of three months .  This is due to geological complexities and congested work areas , which necessitate extra caution in work processes .  Moreover , additional care has to be exercised to minimize adverse impact on residents of nearby blocks all of which have been occupied .  The monitoring process and works schedule have therefore been longer than expected .  
Elders Also Receive a Baptism in the New Tide : At the end of 1989 , the Kuomintang implemented a party primary system to determine nominees , which fit better with the democratic spirit . The number of seats occupied by women suddenly shot up , with fourteen women among the 101 supplementary legislators ( one of whom has since left to take a cabinet position ) .  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
These programs were connected to the political plan Japan had for its colony : Japanese leaders felt that Taiwan occupied an important strategic position astride the East and South China seas , and the navy was especially anxious to exert effective control over Taiwan and the Pescadores . Not only did they want to build Taiwan into a base for further military expansion , they hoped to squeeze the colony for its economic resources ( such as sugar ) to support capitalist economic development in the mother country .  
When he hears talk about the elements now making up the temple milieu he perks up and begins pointing all around , explaining this and that in an amiable and composed way . He points out that the courtyard outside the threshold is a " political zone . " The walkways - - which in a Chinese temple are covered and skirt the outside of the main courtyard - - are occupied by little groups of fortune-tellers , devout Buddhists , and elderly men , each conversing on their own themes .  
Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
Of Taiwan 's offshore islands , because Kinmen and Matsu are in a high state of military readiness , it would be costly to attack them . Thus , the PRC could choose to assault those islands in the South China Sea which are currently occupied by ROC forces . Another possible form of small-scale military conflict would be the use of surface-to-surface guided missiles . Since the political effectiveness of such missiles against offshore islands would be limited , these would more likely be targeted against political or economic centers in Taiwan itself .  
Banu Gabamumu , president of their cultural development association , spent many days inspecting the damage in the Shao ancestral lands around Sun Moon Lake . On seeing how the earthquake had almost split Kuanghua Island into pieces , he said : " This place , which we call Lalu , used to be the home of our highest ancestral spirit . But later it was occupied by the Han Chinese spirit the Old Man Under the Moon . Perhaps now our ancestor has grown angry , and wants to take back the land He lost . "  
While in prison she kept herself occupied by studying philosophy , writing novels , and doing embroidery , but it was a very bleak time . She was still in jail when her mother died .

Hungary is a small nation that al-ways held itself aloof from the rest of the world , but was also plagued by countless calamities , and was time and again " liberated " by foreign nations . After the great catastrophe of the Tatar ( Mongol ) invasion , Hungary enjoyed several centuries of peace and growth . In the 16th century , the Ottoman Turks invaded Hungary , and occupied it for 150 years . The Turks left a historical legacy of Turkish baths and Byzantine architecture , which remain to this day . . . .

After gaining the understanding of and establishing mutual trust with his previous employer , Chung went into the same business of contract manufacturing of inverters .

He was also occupied by additional investments in more than ten different industries , including real estate , computers , import / export trade , automotive care , and energy-efficient light bulbs .  
" Besides the climatic and geographic advantages , this area has a unique background in terms of human history , " states Chen Chung . If hundreds of years ago Chinese had not flooded into Taiwan and occupied all the lowlying land , the Aboriginal peoples would never have been forced to move to high altitudes . When the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 , overnight the island was flooded with two million refugees and soldiers , creating an immediate shortage of arable land , and spawning an urgent need for development in the mountains .  
The civilian population of the occupied territories has continued to suffer a heavy toll of casualties caused by the disproportionately harsh and violent methods employed by the Israeli authorities to repress the popular uprising .

My Government also considers that all the steps and measures taken by the Israeli occupation authorities with the aim of altering the legal status and demographic character of the Palestinian and Arab occupied territories , particularly with regard to Al-Quds , are null and void and constitute a serious breach of international law .  Peace , security , stability and development in the Middle East require the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the region , including nuclear weapons .  
In this context , we call on the international community to support appropriately the commendable efforts of the Palestinian Authority for economic , social and cultural development in the occupied territories and to consolidate the institutional and socio-economic structures of the emerging Palestinian entity so that it will be able to fulfil its responsibilities in the best possible conditions . 
It provided a real and immediate opportunity for the Palestinian people and their nascent government authority to elaborate appropriate policies , establish and build credible institutions and implement urgent programmes aimed at guiding the process of structural transformation in the occupied territory during the five-year interim period .  
Croatia has even accepted considerable modifications to the Vance Plan , such as the establishment of the " pink zones " and the " blue lines " , the latter being an element of the Zagreb Cease-fire Agreement of 29 March 1994 , which has been grossly violated , most blatantly so through the coordinated offensive and aggression on Biha _ by the Serbs from the occupied territories of Croatia .  
She concluded by stressing the need for the strict observance in the occupied territory of international human rights instruments and humanitarian law , particularly as set out in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , since such instruments were the sole guarantee of the promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people and were the instruments on which the Palestinian people relied for justice .  
Meanwhile the Greek Cypriots living in the occupied territory ( whose numbers had dropped from 22,000 in 1974 to less than 550 in 1994 ) continued to be the victims of discriminatory measures , harassment and violent acts and to suffer human rights violations ( 1,619 Greek Cypriots had disappeared ) and systematic looting of the cultural heritage of Cyprus .  
In the light of overwhelming Croatian public support and the support of almost all of the parliamentary parties regarding the termination of the UNPROFOR mandate , the Sabor of the Republic of Croatia reiterates that negotiations , as well as the implementation of all basic provisions of United Nations Security Council resolutions , i.e . a peaceful reintegration of occupied territories , remain a permanent Croatian policy objective and orientation .  
Few impediments to progress are more implacable and emotional than that of Israeli settlers who both remain in and continue to settle the occupied territories , and that this could be supported by the Israeli Government in full knowledge of the ultimate and unavoidable consequences is difficult to believe when there is plainly a direct correlation between the violence in the occupied territories and the continued expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank . 
In addition to the highest-ranked professional officers listed in the annex , there are approximately 6,000 other officers and petty officers commissioned in the " Army of Yugoslavia " who are detached to the general headquarters of the " Serbian Army of Krajina " and other paramilitary units in the occupied territories of Croatia ; of these , there are an additional 30 colonels , 170 lieutenant colonels and 150 majors .  
By its presence in Croatia over the past three years , UNPROFOR has contributed positively by keeping relative peace in Croatia and has given the international community time to establish a political framework and binding legal decisions that will assist in reintegrating the occupied territories and their residents into Croatia peacefully and in a manner consistent with Croatia \ x { e5b8 } sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
In the CIS countries , Governments , in compliance with the provisions of the signed standard basic agreement , have each agreed to provide and have identified a building to house the United Nations system on a rent-free basis ; however , the costs of the renovation to convert such buildings into functional offices will have to be borne by the participating agencies , based on the office area to be occupied .  
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
Faced with the joint and highly coordinated offensive military activities of the Croatian and Bosnian Serbs , and the growing interference of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , the Republic of Croatia presented the Croatian Serb leaders with a clear choice : to accept immediately the principles of peaceful reintegration or face police and military action aimed at restoring Croatian sovereignty over its occupied territories .  
After four years of the utmost patience and restraint , the Republic of Croatia accurately concluded that the least costly solution for both Croatia and the international community to end Croatia 's agony and the international community 's humanitarian concerns in Bosnia and Herzegovina would require a limited but credible use of force that would end the siege of Bihac and restore order in adjacent occupied territories of Croatia .  
The Government of the Republic of Croatia is concerned that the magnitude of the human rights abuses against ethnic Croats in the " Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) " as well as in the remaining occupied territories of Croatia and in the parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by Serbs will increase and that this can only raise tensions and hinder the establishment of a lasting peace in the region .

NULLDetermines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
Similarly on the point of occupation , the General Assembly concluded that , " in particular , [ the activities of ] the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) . . . aimed at achieving the integration of the occupied territories of Croatia into the administrative , military , educational , transportation and communication systems of the Federal Republic are illegal , null and void , and must cease immediately " .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,

extremely dangerous trend was emerging with the approach of the twenty-first century ; local wars , particularly within the former Soviet Union , had led to ethnic cleansing and destruction of the economic , historical and cultural wealth of the occupied nation .  
The immediate effects of the beginning of the war in 1991 were as follows : the tourist market was depressed as a result of the lack of security ; many hotels and private accommodations were occupied by displaced persons and refugees ; commercial and communication links were immediately cut from the north ; and routes inland towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were blocked .

obstacles remained , however : harsh economic conditions , the building and expansion of Israeli settlements , the isolation and closure of areas of the occupied territory , including Jerusalem , and land and water confiscation all had a detrimental effect on the situation of Palestinian women and children , who were already suffering from the disastrous consequences of long years of occupation ( rising numbers of refugees and displaced persons , break-up of families , deterioration of health conditions , poor education , rising unemployment and depletion of the environment ) .  
NAJEM ( Lebanon ) said that Israel was responsible for flagrant and persistent violations of human rights in the occupied territories of southern Lebanon , the western Bekaa and surrounding areas .

The machinery of the process took the form of numerous negotiating tracks , from a bilateral track to negotiate a withdrawal from the occupied territories , to a multilateral track to negotiate regional questions , such as disarmament , water , Palestinian refugees and the establishment of regional economic cooperation , which , from the outset , was believed to be the next logical step once peace had been secured through a just and comprehensive political settlement .  
The dawning in the Middle East and the new climate in Palestinian-Israeli relations quickly had a positive impact by breathing fresh life into the region , and as a result Israel and Jordan have established formal diplomatic relations and Syria and Israel have held several talks on substantive issues relating to the occupied Syrian Golan . 
The unbounded enthusiasm felt by so many staff members , the many posts of great responsibility within the Organization that he has occupied with such brilliance , the admirable management of sensitive issues such as Kuwait and Bosnia and Herzegovina , and the smooth conduct of delicate peacekeeping operations attest to the competence and effectiveness of the man and justify the great hopes his appointment has inspired .  
The occupation itself constituted the primary violation of the human rights of the civilian population and was the source of other violations and harsh practices by the occupying Israeli authorities , including closure and sealing of the occupied territories , land confiscation , the demolition of Palestinian homes , the detention of Palestinians , and the killing of Palestinians by military and undercover security forces .  
The operative part of the resolution called on Israel to respect the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , declared invalid all Israeli acts in the occupied Syrian Golan , called on Israel to desist from attempting to alter the physical , demographic , institutional and legal character of the occupied Syrian Golan , and referred to the issue of settlements in that territory .  
The violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by Croatian forces which were mentioned in the Secretary-General 's report on the situation in the occupied territories of Croatia ( A / 50 / 648 ) were a cause of deep concern , and Canada called upon the Croatian Government to prosecute those responsible , to do everything in its power to protect fundamental human freedoms in the territories under its control , and to permit the safe return of refugees and displaced persons .  
The promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people could be guaranteed only by strict observance of the international human rights instruments and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , particularly as set forth in the fourth Geneva Convention .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
Hiding behind a " living shield " of members of the Government forces , they are continuing attacks which are compelling the command of the armed forces of the Republic of Tajikistan to abandon the positions occupied by it in order to avoid unjustified losses of life among military personnel and the civilian population .  
In view of the harsh economic situation , the United Nations Special Coordinator in the occupied territories stated that the standard of living of Palestinians living under the autonomous region of Gaza had declined by 50 per cent since the signing of the Interim Agreement . 8 / A special appeal was launched to the donor community to support the Palestinian authorities in this crucial period . 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic declares that the recent step taken by the Republic of Armenia in signing the aforementioned agreement with the illegal entity established in the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic which is occupied by the Republic of Armenia constitutes gross and undisguised interference in the internal affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic and yet another infringement of the latter 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and that it violates the universally accepted norms of international law and hence can have no legal force whatsoever . 
Stressing that all forms of repression and cruel and inhuman treatment of women and children committed by belligerents in the course of military operations or in occupied territories , including taking them hostage , their imprisonment , the destruction of their dwellings and their forcible eviction , should be considered criminal ,  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous Israeli illegal settlements activities , as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestine women and their families , resulting from the frequent closure and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
To condemn Israel in the strongest terms for its continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa ; and to call upon the international community , and upon the United Nations and all its associated bodies in particular , to strive for the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) and the relevant subsequent resolutions calling for Israel 's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Lebanese territory to the internationally recognized boundaries ;  
To appeal to international organizations and their member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to pay compensation to Lebanon for the damage caused by its repeated attacks on Lebanese territory and to take action to halt the inhumane and oppressive Israeli practices against the peaceful inhabitants of occupied Lebanese territory in the south and the western Bekaa ;  
As long as more than one eighth of Lebanon is occupied and Israeli raids continue to blow up power stations , to interrupt daily life , to stifle the population with their aerial bombardment , killing women , children and the elderly before the eyes of the entire international community , the Security Council 's equating of aggressor and victim in its approach to Lebanon 's complaints will remain devoid of justice .  
This requires : complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 ; complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa to the internationally recognized boundaries ; the complete withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian territories , including Arab Jerusalem ; and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its right to exercise self-determination and establish an independent State on its own soil . 
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .

The Committee wishes to remind the international community that these tragic developments follow repeated warnings about the devastating consequences for Palestinian hopes and living conditions , of the delayed implementation by Israel of the agreements already reached , its prolonged closure of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the resumption of land confiscation and settlement , and actions against Palestinian property and institutions in Jerusalem .  
It recently took concrete form , as everyone knows , through the freezing of the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron , the refusal to resume negotiations on the final situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , the return to the policy of settlements , the blocking off of the Palestinian territories , the confiscation of Arab lands and the collective economic sanctions and daily acts of violence against the unarmed civilian population .  
The swift , bloody events that have taken place in the self-rule areas and the occupied territories , which have left dozens of people dead or wounded , have confirmed that the peace process has reached a serious and crucial stage .  
We in the OIC believe in speeding up the peace process and aim at putting it back on track with a view to establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region and restoring the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people , including their right to return , their right to self-determination and their right to build their own independent State on their national soil with Al-Quds al - Sharif as its capital , as well as a complete and speedy Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan and occupied Lebanese territories .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
The " policies " and " practices " affecting human rights that came within the scope of investigation by the Special Committee referred , in the case of " policies " , to any course of action consciously adopted and pursued by the Government of Israel as part of its declared or undeclared intent ; while " practices " referred to those actions which , irrespective of whether or not they were in implementation of a policy , reflected a pattern of behaviour on the part of the Israeli authorities towards the civilian population in the occupied areas .  
" The inhuman Israeli practices include the various material , political , cultural and social situations of the Arab citizens in the occupied region of the Syrian Arab Golan , not to mention the continuity of settlement policy , advancing to the Arab territories , destruction of building , theft of antiquities , investment and seizure of lands , natural resources and water sources . "  
He stated that none of the criteria used to define ethnic groups or national minorities were applicable to Burundi , since for centuries Hutus and Tutsis had occupied the same geographical area , shared the same religious beliefs and spoken the same language .  
While the authorities have made efforts to ensure that cases of illegally occupied houses are solved , and many of the cases have been dealt with fairly and justly , there still remains a significant amount of unresolved cases where the local authorities have been unable to prevent de facto ethnic discrimination , owing to intimidation , limited capacity of the judiciary , pressure exercised on judges , and in some cases because decisions of eviction have not been enforced by the local police .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
By far the most serious consequence of the virtually hermetic sealing off of the occupied territories was the significant deterioration of economic and social conditions , with a reported 60-per-cent unemployment rate and nearly 60,000 Palestinian workers prevented from reaching their places of employment in Israel , shortages of imported staple goods , the interruption of all imports and consequent business closings , and bleak prospects generally for business .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
The question of Palestine can not be resolved simply through the redeployment of Israeli forces , but only through complete withdrawal of the occupation forces from all the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 , including Jerusalem ; through the dismantling of the Israeli settlements , which have been declared illegal by the international community , as is evident in Security Council Resolutions 465 ( 1980 ) and 478 ( 1980 ) ; and through the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to sovereignty over their land and natural resources .  
The United Arab Emirates , which welcomes the peace process on the basis of international law and the land for peace principle , considers illegal and inadmissible all current Israeli measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories , including the city of Jerusalem , Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
While the territorial and maritime frontier dispute between the Republic of Cameroon and the Federal Republic of Nigeria is pending before the International Court of Justice , Nigerian authorities have just put into operation electrification and drinking-water supply projects , which , in spite of protests by Cameroon , they implemented in Abana , a town occupied by Nigerian troops and set up as an administrative unit of the federal Nigerian state of Cross River .  
In view of the current serious situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem , the Committee intends to encourage renewed , intensified efforts by non-governmental organizations to organize and coordinate sustained campaigns in order to inform public opinion and to promote national and international action in support of United Nations resolutions and the Committee 's objectives .  
The need for that assistance and support remains urgent amid the current difficult circumstances faced by the Palestinian people of the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip , in view of the stagnation of the peace process and Israeli coercive measures , including closures and restrictions on the movement of workers and commodities to and from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which represent an additional burden increasing the suffering of the Palestinian people .  
This in itself reflects the international community 's rejection of Israel 's racist and extremist practices and policies as well as its condemnation of Israel 's misleading statements and its profound belief that peace in the region is not attainable in accordance with the whims of Mr . Netanyahu , but that it can be achieved only through respect for United Nations resolutions and commitment to the principle of Israel 's full withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and the restoration of those territories to their rightful owners .  
A quick review of its recent report transmitted to the General Assembly indicates that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories expressed its grave concern at the existing human rights situation in the occupied territories as a result of the settlerist policy pursued by the current Israeli Government . 
Israel has continued to spread illegal settlements in the occupied territories , provoking in response deadly terrorist attacks against innocent Israeli citizens by frustrated Palestinians who see no hope in a peace process which has been in a state of prostration for more than a year .  
Unfortunately , these gains were nullified by subsequent events , characterized by the ominous statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister and members of his Government and backed by continued military occupation ; land confiscation and settlement in the occupied territories ; construction of housing units in the settlement of Givat Zeev ; demolition of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories ; confiscation of identity documents of Palestinians ; imposition of closures to drain the Palestinian economy , resulting in the loss of potential income ; and systematic change in the physical character and demographic composition of Jerusalem .  
And only a few days ago the Assembly extensively considered the question of Palestine and expressed its views in no uncertain terms on the Government of Israel 's continued evasion of the commitments and agreements reached as well as its blatant unilateral measures to impose a fait accompli in the occupied Palestinian territory .  
It has been recognized in all international legal and political forums that East Jerusalem is an organic part of the West Bank occupied since 1967 and that the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , applies there , as do the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
The Ministers asserted that the establishment of truly cooperative relations between regional parties in the Middle East was subject to complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab land , and the achievement by the Palestinian people of their legitimate national rights , in order that a climate of peace , security and stability could prevail in the region .  
My delegation , therefore , can not accept any policies adopted or illegal measures taken by Israel in occupied East Jerusalem aimed at judaizing the city and changing its legal status and demographic character to advance its own political and strategic interests .  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , is applicable to the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographic and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ fourth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,3 and have no legal effect ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
To condemn Israel in the strongest terms for its persistence in making repeated attacks on Lebanese territory ; and to appeal to the international community , international organizations and their member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to pay compensation to Lebanon for the damage caused by its repeated attacks on Lebanese territory , particularly for the attack it launched against Lebanon during April 1996 , and to take action to halt the inhumane and oppressive Israeli practices against the peaceful inhabitants of occupied Lebanese territory in the south and the western Bekaa ;  
To condemn the persistent Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied regions of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa , as exemplified by the kidnapping and arbitrary arrest of civilians and the destruction of their homes , the confiscation of their property and their expulsion from their land , as well as by the shelling of peaceful villages and urban areas ;  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous Israeli illegal settlements activities as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestinian women and their families , resulting from the frequent closure and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
Whereas the Oslo , Washington and Cairo accords raised hopeful prospects for a just and lasting peaceful solution leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital , the new Israeli Government has embarked on a policy of colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories with the aim of creating situations of fait accompli on the ground .  
It is obvious that the Turkish selective quotations are intended to divert attention from the continuous violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Cyprus by Turkey and , in particular , of the few Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the occupied territory .  
The request is made bearing in mind that , following the recent nationwide local elections , new local authorities have been elected and established in the last remaining occupied territory of Croatia , and that the reintegration of that territory has been largely completed .  
I would point out that the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus contains a large part of the island 's archaeological and historic sites , as well as religious monuments , which are subject to severe and extensive destruction , of which Turkey , as the occupying Power , is fully responsible and accountable .  
In connection with the preparation of this notorious provocative act of sabotage , the Milli Majlis of Azerbaijan states that the new so-called " presidential elections " planned to be held in the occupied territory of the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic contradict all the principles and norms of international law , and that if these elections are held they can have no legal result .  
That concern was evoked by the fact that the situation in the occupied territories was growing worse each day , as shown by the total blockade of the territories and the restrictions imposed on freedom of movement , which , in turn , had a catastrophic impact on the economic and social situation , health care , education and freedom of religion . 
Such policies constitute a flagrant violation of humanitarian law , international legitimacy and the accords concluded between the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel , as do the ensuing serious actions , including the expansion of illegal settler activities in Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 , particularly in Jerusalem ; the expropriation of Palestinian lands and the demolition of houses ; resort to alleged security reasons in order to carry out measures of collective punishment ; and the imposition of an economic blockade .  
If we are to be occupied , and not only preoccupied , with reform , let us reject , as incompatible with this Organization , the corporate and transnational approach promoted by some of the main United Nations contributors , as if this building were a stock exchange and the just desires of the peoples were mere merchandise .  
We support the Syrian position calling for the resumption of the negotiations with the current Israeli Government from where they ended with the previous Israeli Government , based on full and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan to the boundaries prior to 4 June 1967 , with the concomitant mutual obligations to guarantee the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel and in the region at large .  
The result of this deliberate inflexibility is the perpetuation of the illegal Turkish occupation of 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic by Turkish military forces , the artificial forceful separation of the two communities , the colonization of the occupied area by illegal settlers from Turkey , the refugee problem , the usurpation of the Greek Cypriot properties in the occupied area and the continued blunt violation by the Turkish side of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .  
Mr . Olhaye ( Djibouti ) : The draft resolution under consideration by the General Assembly at this emergency special session , regarding the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , represents , in the light of the enormous implications of Israel 's actions , a reasonable expression of concern and a minimal measure on the part of the international community .  
The denial of basic human rights , the confiscation of one 's rightful property and ancestral home , the denial of free movement , the obstruction of necessary economic activity , the importation of thousands of foreigners to be settled in confiscated land in occupied territory , the systematic and deliberate splitting of the West Bank through streams of bypass highways and indiscriminately placed settlements all these , in our view , amount to a clear record of violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli authorities .  
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .  
The Secretary-General , in his report of 26 June 1997 to the tenth emergency special session , informed Member States that Israel had not abandoned its construction of the new Israeli settlements at Jebel Abu Ghneim and that settlement activity including the expansion of existing settlements , the construction of bypass roads , the confiscation of lands adjacent to settlements and related activities continued unabated throughout the occupied territories , in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
In July this year , earlier in this the tenth emergency special session of the General Assembly on the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , my delegation emphasized , among other things , that it is not possible to divorce the complete nationhood of the Palestinian people from a just , comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East .  
In an open challenge to every provision of international humanitarian law , in pursuance of an exclusive military option and by acquiring a large quantity of weapons and logistical support from abroad , the Taliban mercenaries attacked and occupied part of Charikar , the capital of the province of Parwan to the north of Kabul on 16 January 1997 .  
My delegation is delighted to see the Chair of the CD occupied by a representative of Romania , a country with which Poland is linked by traditional bonds of friendship , which _ as confirmed during the recent visit of the President of Romania , Emil Constantinescu , to Warsaw _ is firmly based on shared values and aspirations .  
The only explanation seems to lie in the fact that Israel has realized that the Security Council is not prepared to live up to its commitments to stop aggression , thanks to the unqualified and continuous support of certain members who , at most and out of sheer embarrassment , express dissatisfaction with the atrocious Israeli practices in the occupied areas .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ fourth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority . 
The delegation of Cyprus had given an accurate and alarming picture of the situation prevailing in the Turkish occupied area of northern Cyprus , where the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Greek Cypriot population were being systematically violated , as they had been throughout the 23-year presence of the Turkish armed forces on the island .  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
He called on the international community to condemn measures taken by the occupying Power in the occupied territories ; many of them were tantamount to collective punishment , had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the inhabitants , and were not only illegal but inhuman .  
He reaffirmed his Governments view that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to territories occupied by Israel since 1967 ; it opposed the specific reference to Jerusalem which had no effect on issues of sovereignty and prejudged the final political arrangements in territories that could be determined only by the direct negotiations to which the parties had committed themselves .  
It had made it clear , moreover , that the timetables laid down in those Agreements would not be respected and had continued with other dangerous violations of the Agreements , including the seizure of Palestinian territory , the intentional delay in its redeployment from Hebron , its continuous attempts to create new facts on the ground in occupied East Jerusalem , and the resumption of colonial settlement activities in the occupied territories , in contravention of the 1949 Geneva Conventions .  
Such violations shall include , but not be limited to , murder , ill _ treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory , murder or ill _ treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas , killing of hostages , plunder of public or private property , wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages , or devastation not justified by military necessity ;  
As you know and as reported by the international news media , upon entering the provinces of Balkh ( Mazar-i-Sharif ) , Jowzjan and Faryab , the Taliban , as in Kabul , Kandahar , Herat and other occupied areas , introduced and sought to implement their self-defined unique version of " Islamic Sharia " by closing girls ' schools , banning women from work and imposing many other repressive restrictions dealing with the work status of women .  
The Ministerial Council observed with great concern the continuing deadlock and deterioration of the peace process in the Middle East and the growing danger of its imminent breakdown as a result of the arbitrary policies and provocative practices pursued by the Israeli Government , with its insistence on building a new settlement in Jerusalem , expanding settlements in the occupied Arab territories and reneging on its commitments relating to the implementation of agreements signed with the Palestinian Authority .  
ESCWA has focused its activities on supporting the economic and social sectors in the occupied territories as well as monitoring their developments through the provision of advisory services and technical assistance and the preparation of reports , analytical studies and project proposals regarding the rehabilitation of the Palestinian economy .  
Furthermore , the report of the Secretary _ General stressed , in paragraph 23 , the persistent violation of the Israeli occupation authorities of the principles of international law , concerning administrative detention of Palestinians and the ill _ treatment and torture to which Palestinians are subjected , in accordance with an official decision made by the High Court and the Government of Israel , in addition to imposing collective punishments on Palestinians , among which is the demolition of houses in Jerusalem and in other regions of the occupied territory .  
In this context we must recall the brutal acts of aggression carried out on Lebanese territory by the Israelis on an almost daily basis , the bombardments by Israeli military aircraft , the use against civilians of proscribed weapons , the naval blockade of Lebanon 's southern coast and the inhumane practices carried out against Lebanese citizens in the occupied area .  
There had been thinly veiled attempts at altering the demographic composition and physical characteristics of the occupied Palestinian territory , incessant human rights violations , plundering of the territory 's natural resources and exploitation of its labour force .  
The expert groups established by the committee had drawn up a national strategy and a triennial plan of action with the objective of guaranteeing the equality of women before the law , the participation of women in all political institutions , an increase in the participation of women in economic activities , the advancement of rural women and support for women in the territories occupied by Israel .  
The closure had had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the occupied territories with at least 10 per cent of the population living below the poverty line and the losses resulting from the current closure estimated at more than US $ 6 million a day , which was more than the financial assistance provided by foreign donors .  
It has not been satisfied with ruining building sites in the occupied Golan since 1967 , including the liberated town of Quneitra , and established in their stead Israeli settlements whose number has gradually increased and risen to 40 settlements inhabited now by about 17,000 Israeli settlers , while suppression is imposed on building throughout the occupied Syrian villages , with heavy taxes imposed on building , which has resulted in an abnormal rise of building prices which is very onerous to the population . 
Those suffering the most are the civilian population of the occupied territories , whose standard of living has been eroded steadily as a result of the very serious economic and social situation .  
Israel , the occupying Power , has committed yet another illegal and provocative action in occupied Jerusalem , in flagrant violation of international law and relevant United Nations resolutions , and in blatant defiance of the international community .  
Greek Cypriot political and military leadership issued provocative statements while air force and naval units engaged in manoeuvres , using live ammunition , which pronounced the element of offence in order to " capture occupied territories " .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,3 and have no legal effect ;  
In many respects , those conditions did not meet contemporary international standards in the field of human rights or the requirements of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 , which the General Assembly had determined was applicable to the occupied territories . 
Consistently and methodically Turkey continues its unabated policy of altering the demographic character of occupied Cyprus through destruction , looting and pillaging of its copious archaeological and religious treasures , which form an integral part of the rich patrimony of the world .  
We were responsible for convening the first periodic meeting on international humanitarian law , which in January 1998 dealt with the protection of humanitarian personnel and so-called unstructured conflicts , and also the expert meeting on the Fourth Geneva Convention , which in October 1998 considered general problems relating to the implementation of the Convention in general and in occupied territories .  
Accordingly , as underlined in no uncertain terms by its Prime Minister , the demand that Eritrea must withdraw from all occupied Ethiopian territories for peace to be achieved between Ethiopia and Eritrea has been a firm Ethiopian position and a fundamental and irreducible minimum condition and not , as alleged by Eritrea , a new element injected by Ethiopia at the eleventh hour .  
The Sudan expressed concern about the children in the southern part of the country , particularly those living in areas occupied by the rebel movement , where they were being exploited , forcibly conscripted , used as human shields , tortured and killed , which must be denounced and condemned by the entire international community .  
By making its withdrawal from the rest of the occupied Ethiopian territory conditional on demilitarization along the common border and on mutual redeployment , Eritrea is simply confirming that its declared acceptance of the Framework Agreement is bogus and , as Ethiopia has already insisted , is tactical and designed to buy time .  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ sixth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority .  
Reaffirms that all the Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , are illegal , constitute a flagrant violation of the provisions of the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and of the principles of international law , and should be dismantled in order to achieve a just , permanent and comprehensive peace in the region of the Middle East ;  
Also reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have no legal effect ;  
Finally , in the smaller translation and editorial units at the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the regional commissions , the total absence of posts at the P-5 level , except those occupied by managers overseeing all conference services at those duty stations , means that all prospects of advancement to the P-5 level of any translator or editor , however competent , is contingent on a transfer to one of the three larger conference centres . 
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Reaffirms that all the Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , are illegal , constitute a flagrant violation of the provisions of the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and of the principles of international law , and should be dismantled in order to achieve a just , permanent and comprehensive peace in the region of the Middle East ;  
Also reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have no legal effect ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ sixth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority . 
For the information of the Sub-Commission , the secretariat has also prepared ( annex II ) a list of country situations currently being considered by the Commission under the agenda items entitled Organization of the work of the session , The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and Advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights . the occupied Arab territories ,  
The C-130 and the unidentified type of aircraft , violated the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus , flying over the area of Mesaoria before landing at the illegal airport of Tymbou in the occupied area of the Republic , from where they departed the same day , returning to the FIR of Ankara .  
The absence of resolve to call upon Eritrea to withdraw from all the territories it occupied by force ( as it was required to do ) , coupled with the lack of readiness of the Eritrean regime to reverse its aggression , no doubt encouraged Asmara to embark on repeated and futile efforts to regain the Badme area in late March and late May 1999 .  
Contrary to what the aggressors are doing in the occupied territories , where civilians , including vulnerable persons , are massacred , raped , tortured , deported and robbed of their personal possessions and property , the Government of National Salvation , mindful of its international commitments , is protecting Rwandan , Ugandan and Burundian Tutsis in appropriate sites .  
The purpose of the Makobola massacre was to pin the blame for that criminal act on the regular forces of the Congolese Armed Forces and on their supreme commander , M'zee Laurent-Dsir Kabila , as was done recently in the slaughter of six Western tourists in Uganda ; people have sought to blame that on the Congolese State , ignoring the fact that that crime was committed in territories occupied and controlled by the aggressor States and their RCD and Mouvement de Libration du Congo ( MLC ) agents . 
UNTAES was created in an environment favourable to its ultimate goal of peaceful reintegration of the formerly occupied Croatian territory : we had the agreement of the parties to the conflict ; recourse to the military option was unattractive to all interested parties ; and the political goal of peaceful reintegration was clearly set and known , as well as supported by the political will of the host Government , the international community and the skilled United Nations leadership in the field .  
Monitoring and documenting economic and social conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory and providing periodic analyses on these aspects and special reports on specific issues relevant to the development effort , such as the prospects for growth in the private sector and the constraints thereon ;  
The Economic and Social Monitoring Unit continued to publish periodic reports on economic and social conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory , in addition to a special report entitled The economy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip : a retrospective on the 1990s and future challenges .  
The Working Group decided , inter alia : that monthly meetings will be held , starting early August ; that the number of law enforcement personnel on both sides will be brought in line with agreed levels ; that all fortifications and positions along the line of separation will be dismantled by 10 July and no new positions will be occupied ; and that the sides will propose by 10 July concrete measures for the withdrawal of forces and redeployment to rear positions .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
The CN-235 and the unknown type of Turkish military aircraft violated the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus , flying over the area of Mesaoria , before landing at the illegal airport of Tymbou in the occupied area of the Republic , from where they departed on the same day , returning to the FIR of Ankara .  
In Nairobi , the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) are charged for the space occupied at the United Nations premises at Gigiri on the basis of a local commercial rate , minus a percentage equivalent to the share of regular budgetary resources of each programme .  
In that context , it was regrettable that Israel continued to apply inhumane practices against the Palestinian people of the occupied territories and to confiscate their land , water and other natural resources , in flagrant violation of the principle , based on the Charter of the United Nations and international law , that land and other resources could not legitimately be acquired by force .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,3 and have no legal effect ;  
Welcomes the increased cooperation between the Agency and international and regional organizations , States and relevant agencies and non-governmental organizations , which is essential to enhancing the contributions of the Agency towards improved conditions for the refugees and thereby the social stability of the occupied territory ;  
Despite the positive developments connected with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority , economic activities had been adversely affected by a prolonged fall in living conditions , high unemployment and border closures , which led to an internal geographic separation of the occupied Palestinian territory .  
In addition to discrimination , violence and poverty , Palestinian women faced the harsh oppressive reality of the Israeli occupation on a daily basis : the construction and expansion of illegal Israeli colonial settlements , the confiscation of land and water , and the recurrent closing of the borders of the occupied Palestinian Territory , which included Jerusalem .  
Welcomes the increased cooperation between the Agency and international and regional organizations , States and relevant agencies and non-governmental organizations , which is essential to enhancing the contributions of the Agency towards improved conditions for the refugees and thereby the social stability of the occupied territory ;  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,23 and have no legal effect ;  
In Africa , in particular , children were all too often the victims of armed conflict , a situation aggravated by natural disaster , disease , an adverse economic environment and the growing burden of foreign debt , while in Palestine and other occupied territories , children were being killed , tortured and imprisoned without having committed any crime .  
He reaffirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , but opposed specific reference to Jerusalem in the resolutions in question because , just as the conference of 15 July attended by some High Contracting Parties had served only to divert attention from the peace process , such references sought to prejudge arrangements which could be determined only by direct negotiations between the parties .  
The report showed that the human rights situation in the occupied territories had remained very much the same as in previous years : the Israeli authorities were continuing to pursue their repressive practices , with a heavy psychological impact on the Arabs living under Israeli occupation .  
Israels ongoing policy of establishing settlements in the West Bank , including Jerusalem , and the other occupied Arab territories violated the resolutions adopted by the international community , which had declared those settlements illegal , obstructed a peaceful settlement , and were incompatible with the principles upon which the peace process was based .  
His delegation was extremely concerned about the unabated racist measures adopted by the Eritrean regime against Ethiopians living both in Eritrea and in the occupied Ethiopian territory , for whom denial of human rights , lack of legal remedies and outright discrimination had become the order of the day .  
Many still wish to return to the properties they occupied prior to the war , but return has been made difficult by complicated property laws that have not been implemented and by the difficult economic , security and political realities facing those who would now be part of ethnic minorities in their pre-war communities .  
However , the continuous , intransigent Israeli position in violation of international legitimacy with regard to returning the occupied Palestinian , Syrian and Lebanese territories to their rightful sovereigns , which is the first and basic prerequisite for establishing peace , continues to impede the effective resumption of these negotiations .  
Let me refer here to the fact that the Security Council has repeatedly stressed in its relevant resolutions that Jerusalem is an indivisible part of the occupied land and that all Israeli measures aimed at changing the legal and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem are null and void .  
Furthermore , the efforts of UNESCO to link existing databases and identification systems to allow for electronic transmission of information concerning stolen cultural property , including those removed from areas of conflict and occupied territories , is viewed by my delegation as a primary weapon in the ongoing struggle to achieve an advantage over those engaged in the smuggling trade .  
Once again , the international community finds itself obliged to take action ; once again , Member States find themselves obliged to resume the tenth emergency special session in the face of Israel ' s intransigence and its insistence on continuing its illegal actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , in grave violation of international law , international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions .  
They are unilateral attempts to change the legal , historical and demographic composition of the occupied territories and are aimed at imposing a fait accompli on the ground prior to the final status negotiations to determine the fate of the Palestinian people and its attempt to establish its independent State on its national soil , as other peoples of the world have done .  
Paragraph 2 reaffirms that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel which have altered or purport to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian Territory , including the law adopted recently on 26 January 1999 and the legislation of 27 January 1999 , are all null and void and have no validity whatsoever .  
We are all aware of the grave repercussions of such illegal measures and the adverse consequences of making the whole region face an untenable situation , and our deliberations are being held to reject Israeli settlement policies which are aimed at altering the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Measures such as these , and any others intended to alter the legal status and the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , are inherently null and void ; they are unlawful and in breach of the fundamental norms of international law and international humanitarian law .  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous illegal Israeli settlements activities , as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestinian women and their families , resulting from the frequent closures and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
Mr . SLADE ( Samoa ) said that the aspiration to establish a permanent international criminal court had occupied the international community for much of the twentieth century , which had experienced the horrors of two world wars and the atrocities of countless civil conflicts .

It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
Achieving a just , comprehensive and lasting peace requires putting an end to Israels occupation of all occupied Palestinian territories , including AlQuds AlSharif , and enabling the Palestinian people to secure their legitimate national and political rights .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
In the countries middle of an acute crisis and we have several examples of such crises in Africa the United Nations and the donors face the worst possible conditions in war-torn and occupied countries , with their resources sometimes plundered , and with a lack of clear political prospects for restoring trust among the people .  In these conditions , to start implementing the economic and social development programmes that are necessary for bringing about a lasting resolution to the crisis is a considerable challenge .  
Thirdly , the failure of the Security Council to play any meaningful role during the past nine months regarding the ongoing events in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem , in the face of the oppression and brutality inflicted upon the Palestinians , and the failure to provide international protection for the Palestinian people , indeed represent a challenge to the credibility of the Security Council and its ability to fulfil its duties in a firm and consistent manner that is free of double standards .  
Were the Council to fail to effectively assume its responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security or to contain the volatile situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , we fear that , given the inability of the other parties to achieve concrete progress in prevailing upon the Israeli Government to accept steps that would lead to a political solution , the situation would become yet more tense and would get completely out of control , having a very negative impact on the stability of this vital part of our world .  
This debate has been made necessary by an explosive situation that has followed the exacerbation of violence in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem a perverse sequence of indiscriminate or targeted assassinations , outbursts of anger and extreme and disproportionate retaliatory measures on the part of the Israeli troops , and almost desperate retaliatory actions , to say nothing of heinous acts of opportunism on the part of well-known unrepentant extremists .  
The Supreme Council reviewed the bloody events that have taken place in the occupied Palestinian territories owing to the savage aggression , repressive measures and policies of closure and encirclement directed by Israel against a fraternal Palestinian people seeking the restoration of all of its legitimate rights , including its right to return and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital .  
As far as we , the Palestinian people , are concerned , we believe that this failure also means a failure to contribute to ending the tragedy that has been taking place in the occupied Palestinian territories because of the bloody and oppressive campaign waged against our people by Israel the occupying Power and by the leaders in charge and the current and previous Israeli Prime Ministers Messrs . Sharon and Barak through all their declared and expressed statements and positions that run counter to international law and that call for escalation and confrontation .  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have no legal effect ;

The suffering of Palestinian children caused by Israeli acts of aggression aimed at killing and maiming children , coupled with the lack of facilities to shelter them , Israels abandonment of all values and human rights and its flouting of all international instruments , and its refusal to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to establish a just peace in accordance with the legitimate decisions of the international community , causing heightened suffering among the Arab population under occupation and denying their children all the rights enshrined in the precepts of God and humanitarian law .  
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
As a matter of fact , the Armenian falsifiers conveniently disregard so many facts essential to a humane , spirited , forward-looking and constructive understanding of the tragic events which took place within the fold of a dying and partly occupied country , that as a result , only hatred and rage , unfortunately , govern their general attitude towards the Turks .  
The Ministers expressed their serious concern for the threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia in recent months by ethnic Albanian extremist groups , strongly condemning their terrorist acts and armed violence and calling on these groups to stop their actions , to release the hostages , to lay down their weapons and to withdraw immediately from the occupied areas .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
They urged that Israel should be required to pay reparations for the material losses resulting from its aggression against the occupied Palestinian territories , such as the destruction of urban and rural installations , as well as for the many Palestinian lives that have been lost , the serious wounds that have been inflicted and the permanent disabilities that have been caused , as has been the case in the past when compensation has been paid to victims of aggression in similar cases . 
We have the honour to inform you that at two urgent and successive meetings , the first of the Follow-up Committee of the Ninth Islamic Summit Conference and the second of the Islamic Group , both held yesterday , at the ambassadorial level , grave concern was expressed over the deteriorating situation that has developed in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem .  
As a result of a deliberate policy methodically implemented by Turkey in the occupied areas of Cyprus , the cultural identity of the northern part of the island , which dates back to the seventh millennium BC , is in grave danger of being permanently and completely destroyed .  
In paragraph 32 of its concluding observations on the initial report of Israel , the Committee requested the State party to provide additional information on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights in the occupied territories , in order to complete the State partys initial report and thereby ensure full compliance with its reporting obligations .  
The Committee expresses its deep concern about the State partys continuing gross violations of economic , social and cultural rights in the occupied territories , especially the severe measures adopted by the State party to restrict the movement of civilians between points within and outside the occupied territories , severing their access to food , water , health care , education and work .  
The International Labour Organization ( ILO ) maintained close cooperation with the League of Arab States and particularly with its specialized agency , the Arab Labour Organization ( ALO ) , by conducting joint activities and coordinating work pertaining to issues of common interest to both organizations .

If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country , and if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation , it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for " Taiwan independence " and safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
However , if a grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , or if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-Strait reunification through negotiations , then the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfill the great cause of reunification .  
At present , it is particularly necessary to effectively utilize and manage the internet , as it has become the fourth largest mass media next to newspapers , radio , and television .  We should strive to turn our advantageous journalistic resources , cultural resources , and information technology resources into our superiority in online propaganda so that the online position and the mass media in our country will all be occupied with progressive ideology and culture .

The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "

( b ) As compared with the forecast made early this year , the foundation remedial works for Block L of Tin Chung Court are expected to experience a slight slippage of three months .  This is due to geological complexities and congested work areas , which necessitate extra caution in work processes .  Moreover , additional care has to be exercised to minimize adverse impact on residents of nearby blocks all of which have been occupied .  The monitoring process and works schedule have therefore been longer than expected .  
Elders Also Receive a Baptism in the New Tide : At the end of 1989 , the Kuomintang implemented a party primary system to determine nominees , which fit better with the democratic spirit . The number of seats occupied by women suddenly shot up , with fourteen women among the 101 supplementary legislators ( one of whom has since left to take a cabinet position ) .  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
These programs were connected to the political plan Japan had for its colony : Japanese leaders felt that Taiwan occupied an important strategic position astride the East and South China seas , and the navy was especially anxious to exert effective control over Taiwan and the Pescadores .

Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
Of Taiwan 's offshore islands , because Kinmen and Matsu are in a high state of military readiness , it would be costly to attack them . Thus , the PRC could choose to assault those islands in the South China Sea which are currently occupied by ROC forces . Another possible form of small-scale military conflict would be the use of surface-to-surface guided missiles . Since the political effectiveness of such missiles against offshore islands would be limited , these would more likely be targeted against political or economic centers in Taiwan itself .  
Banu Gabamumu , president of their cultural development association , spent many days inspecting the damage in the Shao ancestral lands around Sun Moon Lake . On seeing how the earthquake had almost split Kuanghua Island into pieces , he said : " This place , which we call Lalu , used to be the home of our highest ancestral spirit . But later it was occupied by the Han Chinese spirit the Old Man Under the Moon . Perhaps now our ancestor has grown angry , and wants to take back the land He lost . "  
While in prison she kept herself occupied by studying philosophy , writing novels , and doing embroidery , but it was a very bleak time . She was still in jail when her mother died .

At about noon , the tree is occupied by a pair of black bulbuls . Normally timid when confronted by a predator , the two murmuring bulbuls do n't fly off in a flustered rush when a giant crested goshawk flies near . Instead , they take to the air and chase the goshawk away .

Hungary is a small nation that al-ways held itself aloof from the rest of the world , but was also plagued by countless calamities , and was time and again " liberated " by foreign nations . After the great catastrophe of the Tatar ( Mongol ) invasion , Hungary enjoyed several centuries of peace and growth . In the 16th century , the Ottoman Turks invaded Hungary , and occupied it for 150 years . The Turks left a historical legacy of Turkish baths and Byzantine architecture , which remain to this day . . . .

He was also occupied by additional investments in more than ten different industries , including real estate , computers , import / export trade , automotive care , and energy-efficient light bulbs .  
" Besides the climatic and geographic advantages , this area has a unique background in terms of human history , " states Chen Chung . If hundreds of years ago Chinese had not flooded into Taiwan and occupied all the lowlying land , the Aboriginal peoples would never have been forced to move to high altitudes . When the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 , overnight the island was flooded with two million refugees and soldiers , creating an immediate shortage of arable land , and spawning an urgent need for development in the mountains .  
The civilian population of the occupied territories has continued to suffer a heavy toll of casualties caused by the disproportionately harsh and violent methods employed by the Israeli authorities to repress the popular uprising .  
Mr . Joudeh informed the Special Committee how he had lost his entire crop and stopped farming as a result of the prolonged curfews imposed in the occupied territories after the Gulf War :

It also reaffirmed support for the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people , including their rights to return , to self-determination , and to establish their independent State on their national soil , with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital ; as well as support for the international programmes for economic , social and cultural development in the occupied territories .  
My Government also considers that all the steps and measures taken by the Israeli occupation authorities with the aim of altering the legal status and demographic character of the Palestinian and Arab occupied territories , particularly with regard to Al-Quds , are null and void and constitute a serious breach of international law .  Peace , security , stability and development in the Middle East require the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the region , including nuclear weapons .  
In this context , we call on the international community to support appropriately the commendable efforts of the Palestinian Authority for economic , social and cultural development in the occupied territories and to consolidate the institutional and socio-economic structures of the emerging Palestinian entity so that it will be able to fulfil its responsibilities in the best possible conditions . 
It provided a real and immediate opportunity for the Palestinian people and their nascent government authority to elaborate appropriate policies , establish and build credible institutions and implement urgent programmes aimed at guiding the process of structural transformation in the occupied territory during the five-year interim period .  
Croatia has even accepted considerable modifications to the Vance Plan , such as the establishment of the " pink zones " and the " blue lines " , the latter being an element of the Zagreb Cease-fire Agreement of 29 March 1994 , which has been grossly violated , most blatantly so through the coordinated offensive and aggression on Biha _ by the Serbs from the occupied territories of Croatia .  
She concluded by stressing the need for the strict observance in the occupied territory of international human rights instruments and humanitarian law , particularly as set out in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , since such instruments were the sole guarantee of the promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people and were the instruments on which the Palestinian people relied for justice .  
Meanwhile the Greek Cypriots living in the occupied territory ( whose numbers had dropped from 22,000 in 1974 to less than 550 in 1994 ) continued to be the victims of discriminatory measures , harassment and violent acts and to suffer human rights violations ( 1,619 Greek Cypriots had disappeared ) and systematic looting of the cultural heritage of Cyprus .  
In the light of overwhelming Croatian public support and the support of almost all of the parliamentary parties regarding the termination of the UNPROFOR mandate , the Sabor of the Republic of Croatia reiterates that negotiations , as well as the implementation of all basic provisions of United Nations Security Council resolutions , i.e . a peaceful reintegration of occupied territories , remain a permanent Croatian policy objective and orientation .  
Few impediments to progress are more implacable and emotional than that of Israeli settlers who both remain in and continue to settle the occupied territories , and that this could be supported by the Israeli Government in full knowledge of the ultimate and unavoidable consequences is difficult to believe when there is plainly a direct correlation between the violence in the occupied territories and the continued expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank . 
In addition to the highest-ranked professional officers listed in the annex , there are approximately 6,000 other officers and petty officers commissioned in the " Army of Yugoslavia " who are detached to the general headquarters of the " Serbian Army of Krajina " and other paramilitary units in the occupied territories of Croatia ; of these , there are an additional 30 colonels , 170 lieutenant colonels and 150 majors .  
By its presence in Croatia over the past three years , UNPROFOR has contributed positively by keeping relative peace in Croatia and has given the international community time to establish a political framework and binding legal decisions that will assist in reintegrating the occupied territories and their residents into Croatia peacefully and in a manner consistent with Croatia \ x { e5b8 } sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
In the CIS countries , Governments , in compliance with the provisions of the signed standard basic agreement , have each agreed to provide and have identified a building to house the United Nations system on a rent-free basis ; however , the costs of the renovation to convert such buildings into functional offices will have to be borne by the participating agencies , based on the office area to be occupied .  
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
Faced with the joint and highly coordinated offensive military activities of the Croatian and Bosnian Serbs , and the growing interference of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , the Republic of Croatia presented the Croatian Serb leaders with a clear choice : to accept immediately the principles of peaceful reintegration or face police and military action aimed at restoring Croatian sovereignty over its occupied territories .  
After four years of the utmost patience and restraint , the Republic of Croatia accurately concluded that the least costly solution for both Croatia and the international community to end Croatia 's agony and the international community 's humanitarian concerns in Bosnia and Herzegovina would require a limited but credible use of force that would end the siege of Bihac and restore order in adjacent occupied territories of Croatia .  
The Government of the Republic of Croatia is concerned that the magnitude of the human rights abuses against ethnic Croats in the " Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) " as well as in the remaining occupied territories of Croatia and in the parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by Serbs will increase and that this can only raise tensions and hinder the establishment of a lasting peace in the region .

NULLDetermines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
Similarly on the point of occupation , the General Assembly concluded that , " in particular , [ the activities of ] the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) . . . aimed at achieving the integration of the occupied territories of Croatia into the administrative , military , educational , transportation and communication systems of the Federal Republic are illegal , null and void , and must cease immediately " .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
Some leading representatives of the international community pointed out on more than one occasion that it was operation " Storm " that changed the strategic balance in the former Yugoslavia and paved the way for the negotiated peaceful reintegration of the remaining occupied areas of Croatia and a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Bosnia .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,

extremely dangerous trend was emerging with the approach of the twenty-first century ; local wars , particularly within the former Soviet Union , had led to ethnic cleansing and destruction of the economic , historical and cultural wealth of the occupied nation .  
The immediate effects of the beginning of the war in 1991 were as follows : the tourist market was depressed as a result of the lack of security ; many hotels and private accommodations were occupied by displaced persons and refugees ; commercial and communication links were immediately cut from the north ; and routes inland towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were blocked .

obstacles remained , however : harsh economic conditions , the building and expansion of Israeli settlements , the isolation and closure of areas of the occupied territory , including Jerusalem , and land and water confiscation all had a detrimental effect on the situation of Palestinian women and children , who were already suffering from the disastrous consequences of long years of occupation ( rising numbers of refugees and displaced persons , break-up of families , deterioration of health conditions , poor education , rising unemployment and depletion of the environment ) .  
NAJEM ( Lebanon ) said that Israel was responsible for flagrant and persistent violations of human rights in the occupied territories of southern Lebanon , the western Bekaa and surrounding areas .  
This year 's twenty-second anniversary of the invasion and occupation of substantial territory of the Republic of Cyprus by Turkish forces was marked by the brutal killings of two Greek-Cypriot unarmed demonstrators , witnessed on television screens by the entire world , and the wounding of many others , including two United Nations peace-keepers , by the Turkish occupation troops and Turkish extremists imported from mainland Turkey to the occupied part of the island . 
The machinery of the process took the form of numerous negotiating tracks , from a bilateral track to negotiate a withdrawal from the occupied territories , to a multilateral track to negotiate regional questions , such as disarmament , water , Palestinian refugees and the establishment of regional economic cooperation , which , from the outset , was believed to be the next logical step once peace had been secured through a just and comprehensive political settlement .  
The dawning in the Middle East and the new climate in Palestinian-Israeli relations quickly had a positive impact by breathing fresh life into the region , and as a result Israel and Jordan have established formal diplomatic relations and Syria and Israel have held several talks on substantive issues relating to the occupied Syrian Golan . 
The unbounded enthusiasm felt by so many staff members , the many posts of great responsibility within the Organization that he has occupied with such brilliance , the admirable management of sensitive issues such as Kuwait and Bosnia and Herzegovina , and the smooth conduct of delicate peacekeeping operations attest to the competence and effectiveness of the man and justify the great hopes his appointment has inspired .  
The occupation itself constituted the primary violation of the human rights of the civilian population and was the source of other violations and harsh practices by the occupying Israeli authorities , including closure and sealing of the occupied territories , land confiscation , the demolition of Palestinian homes , the detention of Palestinians , and the killing of Palestinians by military and undercover security forces .  
The operative part of the resolution called on Israel to respect the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , declared invalid all Israeli acts in the occupied Syrian Golan , called on Israel to desist from attempting to alter the physical , demographic , institutional and legal character of the occupied Syrian Golan , and referred to the issue of settlements in that territory .  
The violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by Croatian forces which were mentioned in the Secretary-General 's report on the situation in the occupied territories of Croatia ( A / 50 / 648 ) were a cause of deep concern , and Canada called upon the Croatian Government to prosecute those responsible , to do everything in its power to protect fundamental human freedoms in the territories under its control , and to permit the safe return of refugees and displaced persons .  
The promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people could be guaranteed only by strict observance of the international human rights instruments and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , particularly as set forth in the fourth Geneva Convention .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
Hiding behind a " living shield " of members of the Government forces , they are continuing attacks which are compelling the command of the armed forces of the Republic of Tajikistan to abandon the positions occupied by it in order to avoid unjustified losses of life among military personnel and the civilian population .  
In view of the harsh economic situation , the United Nations Special Coordinator in the occupied territories stated that the standard of living of Palestinians living under the autonomous region of Gaza had declined by 50 per cent since the signing of the Interim Agreement . 8 / A special appeal was launched to the donor community to support the Palestinian authorities in this crucial period . 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic declares that the recent step taken by the Republic of Armenia in signing the aforementioned agreement with the illegal entity established in the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic which is occupied by the Republic of Armenia constitutes gross and undisguised interference in the internal affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic and yet another infringement of the latter 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and that it violates the universally accepted norms of international law and hence can have no legal force whatsoever . 
Stressing that all forms of repression and cruel and inhuman treatment of women and children committed by belligerents in the course of military operations or in occupied territories , including taking them hostage , their imprisonment , the destruction of their dwellings and their forcible eviction , should be considered criminal ,  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous Israeli illegal settlements activities , as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestine women and their families , resulting from the frequent closure and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
To condemn Israel in the strongest terms for its continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa ; and to call upon the international community , and upon the United Nations and all its associated bodies in particular , to strive for the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) and the relevant subsequent resolutions calling for Israel 's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Lebanese territory to the internationally recognized boundaries ;  
To appeal to international organizations and their member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to pay compensation to Lebanon for the damage caused by its repeated attacks on Lebanese territory and to take action to halt the inhumane and oppressive Israeli practices against the peaceful inhabitants of occupied Lebanese territory in the south and the western Bekaa ;  
As long as more than one eighth of Lebanon is occupied and Israeli raids continue to blow up power stations , to interrupt daily life , to stifle the population with their aerial bombardment , killing women , children and the elderly before the eyes of the entire international community , the Security Council 's equating of aggressor and victim in its approach to Lebanon 's complaints will remain devoid of justice .  
This requires : complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 ; complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa to the internationally recognized boundaries ; the complete withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian territories , including Arab Jerusalem ; and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its right to exercise self-determination and establish an independent State on its own soil . 
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
The Committee wishes to remind the international community that these tragic developments follow repeated warnings about the devastating consequences for Palestinian hopes and living conditions , of the delayed implementation by Israel of the agreements already reached , its prolonged closure of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the resumption of land confiscation and settlement , and actions against Palestinian property and institutions in Jerusalem .  
It recently took concrete form , as everyone knows , through the freezing of the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron , the refusal to resume negotiations on the final situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , the return to the policy of settlements , the blocking off of the Palestinian territories , the confiscation of Arab lands and the collective economic sanctions and daily acts of violence against the unarmed civilian population .  
The swift , bloody events that have taken place in the self-rule areas and the occupied territories , which have left dozens of people dead or wounded , have confirmed that the peace process has reached a serious and crucial stage .  
We in the OIC believe in speeding up the peace process and aim at putting it back on track with a view to establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region and restoring the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people , including their right to return , their right to self-determination and their right to build their own independent State on their national soil with Al-Quds al - Sharif as its capital , as well as a complete and speedy Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan and occupied Lebanese territories .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
The " policies " and " practices " affecting human rights that came within the scope of investigation by the Special Committee referred , in the case of " policies " , to any course of action consciously adopted and pursued by the Government of Israel as part of its declared or undeclared intent ; while " practices " referred to those actions which , irrespective of whether or not they were in implementation of a policy , reflected a pattern of behaviour on the part of the Israeli authorities towards the civilian population in the occupied areas .  
" The inhuman Israeli practices include the various material , political , cultural and social situations of the Arab citizens in the occupied region of the Syrian Arab Golan , not to mention the continuity of settlement policy , advancing to the Arab territories , destruction of building , theft of antiquities , investment and seizure of lands , natural resources and water sources . "  
He stated that none of the criteria used to define ethnic groups or national minorities were applicable to Burundi , since for centuries Hutus and Tutsis had occupied the same geographical area , shared the same religious beliefs and spoken the same language .  
While the authorities have made efforts to ensure that cases of illegally occupied houses are solved , and many of the cases have been dealt with fairly and justly , there still remains a significant amount of unresolved cases where the local authorities have been unable to prevent de facto ethnic discrimination , owing to intimidation , limited capacity of the judiciary , pressure exercised on judges , and in some cases because decisions of eviction have not been enforced by the local police .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
By far the most serious consequence of the virtually hermetic sealing off of the occupied territories was the significant deterioration of economic and social conditions , with a reported 60-per-cent unemployment rate and nearly 60,000 Palestinian workers prevented from reaching their places of employment in Israel , shortages of imported staple goods , the interruption of all imports and consequent business closings , and bleak prospects generally for business .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
The question of Palestine can not be resolved simply through the redeployment of Israeli forces , but only through complete withdrawal of the occupation forces from all the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 , including Jerusalem ; through the dismantling of the Israeli settlements , which have been declared illegal by the international community , as is evident in Security Council Resolutions 465 ( 1980 ) and 478 ( 1980 ) ; and through the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to sovereignty over their land and natural resources .  
The United Arab Emirates , which welcomes the peace process on the basis of international law and the land for peace principle , considers illegal and inadmissible all current Israeli measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories , including the city of Jerusalem , Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
While the territorial and maritime frontier dispute between the Republic of Cameroon and the Federal Republic of Nigeria is pending before the International Court of Justice , Nigerian authorities have just put into operation electrification and drinking-water supply projects , which , in spite of protests by Cameroon , they implemented in Abana , a town occupied by Nigerian troops and set up as an administrative unit of the federal Nigerian state of Cross River .  
In view of the current serious situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem , the Committee intends to encourage renewed , intensified efforts by non-governmental organizations to organize and coordinate sustained campaigns in order to inform public opinion and to promote national and international action in support of United Nations resolutions and the Committee 's objectives .  
The need for that assistance and support remains urgent amid the current difficult circumstances faced by the Palestinian people of the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip , in view of the stagnation of the peace process and Israeli coercive measures , including closures and restrictions on the movement of workers and commodities to and from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which represent an additional burden increasing the suffering of the Palestinian people .  
This in itself reflects the international community 's rejection of Israel 's racist and extremist practices and policies as well as its condemnation of Israel 's misleading statements and its profound belief that peace in the region is not attainable in accordance with the whims of Mr . Netanyahu , but that it can be achieved only through respect for United Nations resolutions and commitment to the principle of Israel 's full withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and the restoration of those territories to their rightful owners .  
A quick review of its recent report transmitted to the General Assembly indicates that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories expressed its grave concern at the existing human rights situation in the occupied territories as a result of the settlerist policy pursued by the current Israeli Government . 
Israel has continued to spread illegal settlements in the occupied territories , provoking in response deadly terrorist attacks against innocent Israeli citizens by frustrated Palestinians who see no hope in a peace process which has been in a state of prostration for more than a year .  
Unfortunately , these gains were nullified by subsequent events , characterized by the ominous statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister and members of his Government and backed by continued military occupation ; land confiscation and settlement in the occupied territories ; construction of housing units in the settlement of Givat Zeev ; demolition of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories ; confiscation of identity documents of Palestinians ; imposition of closures to drain the Palestinian economy , resulting in the loss of potential income ; and systematic change in the physical character and demographic composition of Jerusalem .  
And only a few days ago the Assembly extensively considered the question of Palestine and expressed its views in no uncertain terms on the Government of Israel 's continued evasion of the commitments and agreements reached as well as its blatant unilateral measures to impose a fait accompli in the occupied Palestinian territory .  
It has been recognized in all international legal and political forums that East Jerusalem is an organic part of the West Bank occupied since 1967 and that the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , applies there , as do the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
The Ministers asserted that the establishment of truly cooperative relations between regional parties in the Middle East was subject to complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab land , and the achievement by the Palestinian people of their legitimate national rights , in order that a climate of peace , security and stability could prevail in the region .  
My delegation , therefore , can not accept any policies adopted or illegal measures taken by Israel in occupied East Jerusalem aimed at judaizing the city and changing its legal status and demographic character to advance its own political and strategic interests .  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , is applicable to the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographic and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ fourth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,3 and have no legal effect ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
To condemn Israel in the strongest terms for its persistence in making repeated attacks on Lebanese territory ; and to appeal to the international community , international organizations and their member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to pay compensation to Lebanon for the damage caused by its repeated attacks on Lebanese territory , particularly for the attack it launched against Lebanon during April 1996 , and to take action to halt the inhumane and oppressive Israeli practices against the peaceful inhabitants of occupied Lebanese territory in the south and the western Bekaa ;  
To condemn the persistent Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied regions of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa , as exemplified by the kidnapping and arbitrary arrest of civilians and the destruction of their homes , the confiscation of their property and their expulsion from their land , as well as by the shelling of peaceful villages and urban areas ;  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous Israeli illegal settlements activities as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestinian women and their families , resulting from the frequent closure and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
Whereas the Oslo , Washington and Cairo accords raised hopeful prospects for a just and lasting peaceful solution leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital , the new Israeli Government has embarked on a policy of colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories with the aim of creating situations of fait accompli on the ground .  
It is obvious that the Turkish selective quotations are intended to divert attention from the continuous violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Cyprus by Turkey and , in particular , of the few Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the occupied territory .  
The request is made bearing in mind that , following the recent nationwide local elections , new local authorities have been elected and established in the last remaining occupied territory of Croatia , and that the reintegration of that territory has been largely completed .  
I would point out that the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus contains a large part of the island 's archaeological and historic sites , as well as religious monuments , which are subject to severe and extensive destruction , of which Turkey , as the occupying Power , is fully responsible and accountable .  
In connection with the preparation of this notorious provocative act of sabotage , the Milli Majlis of Azerbaijan states that the new so-called " presidential elections " planned to be held in the occupied territory of the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic contradict all the principles and norms of international law , and that if these elections are held they can have no legal result .  
That concern was evoked by the fact that the situation in the occupied territories was growing worse each day , as shown by the total blockade of the territories and the restrictions imposed on freedom of movement , which , in turn , had a catastrophic impact on the economic and social situation , health care , education and freedom of religion . 
Such policies constitute a flagrant violation of humanitarian law , international legitimacy and the accords concluded between the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel , as do the ensuing serious actions , including the expansion of illegal settler activities in Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 , particularly in Jerusalem ; the expropriation of Palestinian lands and the demolition of houses ; resort to alleged security reasons in order to carry out measures of collective punishment ; and the imposition of an economic blockade .  
If we are to be occupied , and not only preoccupied , with reform , let us reject , as incompatible with this Organization , the corporate and transnational approach promoted by some of the main United Nations contributors , as if this building were a stock exchange and the just desires of the peoples were mere merchandise .  
We support the Syrian position calling for the resumption of the negotiations with the current Israeli Government from where they ended with the previous Israeli Government , based on full and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan to the boundaries prior to 4 June 1967 , with the concomitant mutual obligations to guarantee the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel and in the region at large .  
The result of this deliberate inflexibility is the perpetuation of the illegal Turkish occupation of 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic by Turkish military forces , the artificial forceful separation of the two communities , the colonization of the occupied area by illegal settlers from Turkey , the refugee problem , the usurpation of the Greek Cypriot properties in the occupied area and the continued blunt violation by the Turkish side of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .  
Mr . Olhaye ( Djibouti ) : The draft resolution under consideration by the General Assembly at this emergency special session , regarding the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , represents , in the light of the enormous implications of Israel 's actions , a reasonable expression of concern and a minimal measure on the part of the international community .  
The denial of basic human rights , the confiscation of one 's rightful property and ancestral home , the denial of free movement , the obstruction of necessary economic activity , the importation of thousands of foreigners to be settled in confiscated land in occupied territory , the systematic and deliberate splitting of the West Bank through streams of bypass highways and indiscriminately placed settlements all these , in our view , amount to a clear record of violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli authorities .  
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .  
The Secretary-General , in his report of 26 June 1997 to the tenth emergency special session , informed Member States that Israel had not abandoned its construction of the new Israeli settlements at Jebel Abu Ghneim and that settlement activity including the expansion of existing settlements , the construction of bypass roads , the confiscation of lands adjacent to settlements and related activities continued unabated throughout the occupied territories , in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
In July this year , earlier in this the tenth emergency special session of the General Assembly on the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , my delegation emphasized , among other things , that it is not possible to divorce the complete nationhood of the Palestinian people from a just , comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East .  
In an open challenge to every provision of international humanitarian law , in pursuance of an exclusive military option and by acquiring a large quantity of weapons and logistical support from abroad , the Taliban mercenaries attacked and occupied part of Charikar , the capital of the province of Parwan to the north of Kabul on 16 January 1997 .  
My delegation is delighted to see the Chair of the CD occupied by a representative of Romania , a country with which Poland is linked by traditional bonds of friendship , which _ as confirmed during the recent visit of the President of Romania , Emil Constantinescu , to Warsaw _ is firmly based on shared values and aspirations .  
The only explanation seems to lie in the fact that Israel has realized that the Security Council is not prepared to live up to its commitments to stop aggression , thanks to the unqualified and continuous support of certain members who , at most and out of sheer embarrassment , express dissatisfaction with the atrocious Israeli practices in the occupied areas .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ fourth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority . 
The delegation of Cyprus had given an accurate and alarming picture of the situation prevailing in the Turkish occupied area of northern Cyprus , where the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Greek Cypriot population were being systematically violated , as they had been throughout the 23-year presence of the Turkish armed forces on the island .  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
He called on the international community to condemn measures taken by the occupying Power in the occupied territories ; many of them were tantamount to collective punishment , had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the inhabitants , and were not only illegal but inhuman .  
He reaffirmed his Governments view that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to territories occupied by Israel since 1967 ; it opposed the specific reference to Jerusalem which had no effect on issues of sovereignty and prejudged the final political arrangements in territories that could be determined only by the direct negotiations to which the parties had committed themselves .  
It had made it clear , moreover , that the timetables laid down in those Agreements would not be respected and had continued with other dangerous violations of the Agreements , including the seizure of Palestinian territory , the intentional delay in its redeployment from Hebron , its continuous attempts to create new facts on the ground in occupied East Jerusalem , and the resumption of colonial settlement activities in the occupied territories , in contravention of the 1949 Geneva Conventions .  
Such violations shall include , but not be limited to , murder , ill _ treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory , murder or ill _ treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas , killing of hostages , plunder of public or private property , wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages , or devastation not justified by military necessity ;  
As you know and as reported by the international news media , upon entering the provinces of Balkh ( Mazar-i-Sharif ) , Jowzjan and Faryab , the Taliban , as in Kabul , Kandahar , Herat and other occupied areas , introduced and sought to implement their self-defined unique version of " Islamic Sharia " by closing girls ' schools , banning women from work and imposing many other repressive restrictions dealing with the work status of women .  
The Ministerial Council observed with great concern the continuing deadlock and deterioration of the peace process in the Middle East and the growing danger of its imminent breakdown as a result of the arbitrary policies and provocative practices pursued by the Israeli Government , with its insistence on building a new settlement in Jerusalem , expanding settlements in the occupied Arab territories and reneging on its commitments relating to the implementation of agreements signed with the Palestinian Authority .  
ESCWA has focused its activities on supporting the economic and social sectors in the occupied territories as well as monitoring their developments through the provision of advisory services and technical assistance and the preparation of reports , analytical studies and project proposals regarding the rehabilitation of the Palestinian economy .  
Furthermore , the report of the Secretary _ General stressed , in paragraph 23 , the persistent violation of the Israeli occupation authorities of the principles of international law , concerning administrative detention of Palestinians and the ill _ treatment and torture to which Palestinians are subjected , in accordance with an official decision made by the High Court and the Government of Israel , in addition to imposing collective punishments on Palestinians , among which is the demolition of houses in Jerusalem and in other regions of the occupied territory .  
In this context we must recall the brutal acts of aggression carried out on Lebanese territory by the Israelis on an almost daily basis , the bombardments by Israeli military aircraft , the use against civilians of proscribed weapons , the naval blockade of Lebanon 's southern coast and the inhumane practices carried out against Lebanese citizens in the occupied area .  
There had been thinly veiled attempts at altering the demographic composition and physical characteristics of the occupied Palestinian territory , incessant human rights violations , plundering of the territory 's natural resources and exploitation of its labour force .  
The expert groups established by the committee had drawn up a national strategy and a triennial plan of action with the objective of guaranteeing the equality of women before the law , the participation of women in all political institutions , an increase in the participation of women in economic activities , the advancement of rural women and support for women in the territories occupied by Israel .  
The closure had had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the occupied territories with at least 10 per cent of the population living below the poverty line and the losses resulting from the current closure estimated at more than US $ 6 million a day , which was more than the financial assistance provided by foreign donors .  
It has not been satisfied with ruining building sites in the occupied Golan since 1967 , including the liberated town of Quneitra , and established in their stead Israeli settlements whose number has gradually increased and risen to 40 settlements inhabited now by about 17,000 Israeli settlers , while suppression is imposed on building throughout the occupied Syrian villages , with heavy taxes imposed on building , which has resulted in an abnormal rise of building prices which is very onerous to the population . 
Those suffering the most are the civilian population of the occupied territories , whose standard of living has been eroded steadily as a result of the very serious economic and social situation .  
Israel , the occupying Power , has committed yet another illegal and provocative action in occupied Jerusalem , in flagrant violation of international law and relevant United Nations resolutions , and in blatant defiance of the international community .  
Greek Cypriot political and military leadership issued provocative statements while air force and naval units engaged in manoeuvres , using live ammunition , which pronounced the element of offence in order to " capture occupied territories " .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,3 and have no legal effect ;  
In many respects , those conditions did not meet contemporary international standards in the field of human rights or the requirements of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 , which the General Assembly had determined was applicable to the occupied territories . 
Consistently and methodically Turkey continues its unabated policy of altering the demographic character of occupied Cyprus through destruction , looting and pillaging of its copious archaeological and religious treasures , which form an integral part of the rich patrimony of the world .  
We were responsible for convening the first periodic meeting on international humanitarian law , which in January 1998 dealt with the protection of humanitarian personnel and so-called unstructured conflicts , and also the expert meeting on the Fourth Geneva Convention , which in October 1998 considered general problems relating to the implementation of the Convention in general and in occupied territories .  
Accordingly , as underlined in no uncertain terms by its Prime Minister , the demand that Eritrea must withdraw from all occupied Ethiopian territories for peace to be achieved between Ethiopia and Eritrea has been a firm Ethiopian position and a fundamental and irreducible minimum condition and not , as alleged by Eritrea , a new element injected by Ethiopia at the eleventh hour .  
The Sudan expressed concern about the children in the southern part of the country , particularly those living in areas occupied by the rebel movement , where they were being exploited , forcibly conscripted , used as human shields , tortured and killed , which must be denounced and condemned by the entire international community .  
By making its withdrawal from the rest of the occupied Ethiopian territory conditional on demilitarization along the common border and on mutual redeployment , Eritrea is simply confirming that its declared acceptance of the Framework Agreement is bogus and , as Ethiopia has already insisted , is tactical and designed to buy time .

Also reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;

Finally , in the smaller translation and editorial units at the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the regional commissions , the total absence of posts at the P-5 level , except those occupied by managers overseeing all conference services at those duty stations , means that all prospects of advancement to the P-5 level of any translator or editor , however competent , is contingent on a transfer to one of the three larger conference centres . 
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;

Also reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have no legal effect ;

Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ sixth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority .

The C-130 and the unidentified type of aircraft , violated the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus , flying over the area of Mesaoria before landing at the illegal airport of Tymbou in the occupied area of the Republic , from where they departed the same day , returning to the FIR of Ankara .  
The absence of resolve to call upon Eritrea to withdraw from all the territories it occupied by force ( as it was required to do ) , coupled with the lack of readiness of the Eritrean regime to reverse its aggression , no doubt encouraged Asmara to embark on repeated and futile efforts to regain the Badme area in late March and late May 1999 .  
Contrary to what the aggressors are doing in the occupied territories , where civilians , including vulnerable persons , are massacred , raped , tortured , deported and robbed of their personal possessions and property , the Government of National Salvation , mindful of its international commitments , is protecting Rwandan , Ugandan and Burundian Tutsis in appropriate sites .  
The purpose of the Makobola massacre was to pin the blame for that criminal act on the regular forces of the Congolese Armed Forces and on their supreme commander , M'zee Laurent-Dsir Kabila , as was done recently in the slaughter of six Western tourists in Uganda ; people have sought to blame that on the Congolese State , ignoring the fact that that crime was committed in territories occupied and controlled by the aggressor States and their RCD and Mouvement de Libration du Congo ( MLC ) agents . 
UNTAES was created in an environment favourable to its ultimate goal of peaceful reintegration of the formerly occupied Croatian territory : we had the agreement of the parties to the conflict ; recourse to the military option was unattractive to all interested parties ; and the political goal of peaceful reintegration was clearly set and known , as well as supported by the political will of the host Government , the international community and the skilled United Nations leadership in the field .  
Monitoring and documenting economic and social conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory and providing periodic analyses on these aspects and special reports on specific issues relevant to the development effort , such as the prospects for growth in the private sector and the constraints thereon ;  
The Economic and Social Monitoring Unit continued to publish periodic reports on economic and social conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory , in addition to a special report entitled The economy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip : a retrospective on the 1990s and future challenges .  
The Working Group decided , inter alia : that monthly meetings will be held , starting early August ; that the number of law enforcement personnel on both sides will be brought in line with agreed levels ; that all fortifications and positions along the line of separation will be dismantled by 10 July and no new positions will be occupied ; and that the sides will propose by 10 July concrete measures for the withdrawal of forces and redeployment to rear positions .

The CN-235 and the unknown type of Turkish military aircraft violated the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus , flying over the area of Mesaoria , before landing at the illegal airport of Tymbou in the occupied area of the Republic , from where they departed on the same day , returning to the FIR of Ankara .  
In Nairobi , the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) are charged for the space occupied at the United Nations premises at Gigiri on the basis of a local commercial rate , minus a percentage equivalent to the share of regular budgetary resources of each programme .  
In that context , it was regrettable that Israel continued to apply inhumane practices against the Palestinian people of the occupied territories and to confiscate their land , water and other natural resources , in flagrant violation of the principle , based on the Charter of the United Nations and international law , that land and other resources could not legitimately be acquired by force .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,3 and have no legal effect ;  
Welcomes the increased cooperation between the Agency and international and regional organizations , States and relevant agencies and non-governmental organizations , which is essential to enhancing the contributions of the Agency towards improved conditions for the refugees and thereby the social stability of the occupied territory ;  
Despite the positive developments connected with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority , economic activities had been adversely affected by a prolonged fall in living conditions , high unemployment and border closures , which led to an internal geographic separation of the occupied Palestinian territory .  
In addition to discrimination , violence and poverty , Palestinian women faced the harsh oppressive reality of the Israeli occupation on a daily basis : the construction and expansion of illegal Israeli colonial settlements , the confiscation of land and water , and the recurrent closing of the borders of the occupied Palestinian Territory , which included Jerusalem .  
Welcomes the increased cooperation between the Agency and international and regional organizations , States and relevant agencies and non-governmental organizations , which is essential to enhancing the contributions of the Agency towards improved conditions for the refugees and thereby the social stability of the occupied territory ;  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,23 and have no legal effect ;  
In Africa , in particular , children were all too often the victims of armed conflict , a situation aggravated by natural disaster , disease , an adverse economic environment and the growing burden of foreign debt , while in Palestine and other occupied territories , children were being killed , tortured and imprisoned without having committed any crime .  
He reaffirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , but opposed specific reference to Jerusalem in the resolutions in question because , just as the conference of 15 July attended by some High Contracting Parties had served only to divert attention from the peace process , such references sought to prejudge arrangements which could be determined only by direct negotiations between the parties .  
The report showed that the human rights situation in the occupied territories had remained very much the same as in previous years : the Israeli authorities were continuing to pursue their repressive practices , with a heavy psychological impact on the Arabs living under Israeli occupation .  
Israels ongoing policy of establishing settlements in the West Bank , including Jerusalem , and the other occupied Arab territories violated the resolutions adopted by the international community , which had declared those settlements illegal , obstructed a peaceful settlement , and were incompatible with the principles upon which the peace process was based .  
His delegation was extremely concerned about the unabated racist measures adopted by the Eritrean regime against Ethiopians living both in Eritrea and in the occupied Ethiopian territory , for whom denial of human rights , lack of legal remedies and outright discrimination had become the order of the day .  
Many still wish to return to the properties they occupied prior to the war , but return has been made difficult by complicated property laws that have not been implemented and by the difficult economic , security and political realities facing those who would now be part of ethnic minorities in their pre-war communities .  
However , the continuous , intransigent Israeli position in violation of international legitimacy with regard to returning the occupied Palestinian , Syrian and Lebanese territories to their rightful sovereigns , which is the first and basic prerequisite for establishing peace , continues to impede the effective resumption of these negotiations .  
Let me refer here to the fact that the Security Council has repeatedly stressed in its relevant resolutions that Jerusalem is an indivisible part of the occupied land and that all Israeli measures aimed at changing the legal and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem are null and void .  
Furthermore , the efforts of UNESCO to link existing databases and identification systems to allow for electronic transmission of information concerning stolen cultural property , including those removed from areas of conflict and occupied territories , is viewed by my delegation as a primary weapon in the ongoing struggle to achieve an advantage over those engaged in the smuggling trade .  
Once again , the international community finds itself obliged to take action ; once again , Member States find themselves obliged to resume the tenth emergency special session in the face of Israel ' s intransigence and its insistence on continuing its illegal actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , in grave violation of international law , international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions .  
They are unilateral attempts to change the legal , historical and demographic composition of the occupied territories and are aimed at imposing a fait accompli on the ground prior to the final status negotiations to determine the fate of the Palestinian people and its attempt to establish its independent State on its national soil , as other peoples of the world have done .  
Paragraph 2 reaffirms that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel which have altered or purport to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian Territory , including the law adopted recently on 26 January 1999 and the legislation of 27 January 1999 , are all null and void and have no validity whatsoever .  
We are all aware of the grave repercussions of such illegal measures and the adverse consequences of making the whole region face an untenable situation , and our deliberations are being held to reject Israeli settlement policies which are aimed at altering the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Measures such as these , and any others intended to alter the legal status and the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , are inherently null and void ; they are unlawful and in breach of the fundamental norms of international law and international humanitarian law .  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous illegal Israeli settlements activities , as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestinian women and their families , resulting from the frequent closures and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
Mr . SLADE ( Samoa ) said that the aspiration to establish a permanent international criminal court had occupied the international community for much of the twentieth century , which had experienced the horrors of two world wars and the atrocities of countless civil conflicts . 
The report surveys all major properties at principal duty stations and regional commissions occupied by the United Nations , both owned and leased , since there are administrative and financial implications for facilities management and major maintenance under either occupancy condition .  
He expressed concern at the broad language of article 26 , which seemed to give indigenous peoples the right to ownership of land they had traditionally occupied or otherwise used , but pledged his delegations commitment to continuing to work towards a positive resolution of the language of such a valuable article .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
Achieving a just , comprehensive and lasting peace requires putting an end to Israels occupation of all occupied Palestinian territories , including AlQuds AlSharif , and enabling the Palestinian people to secure their legitimate national and political rights .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
In the countries middle of an acute crisis and we have several examples of such crises in Africa the United Nations and the donors face the worst possible conditions in war-torn and occupied countries , with their resources sometimes plundered , and with a lack of clear political prospects for restoring trust among the people .  In these conditions , to start implementing the economic and social development programmes that are necessary for bringing about a lasting resolution to the crisis is a considerable challenge .  
Thirdly , the failure of the Security Council to play any meaningful role during the past nine months regarding the ongoing events in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem , in the face of the oppression and brutality inflicted upon the Palestinians , and the failure to provide international protection for the Palestinian people , indeed represent a challenge to the credibility of the Security Council and its ability to fulfil its duties in a firm and consistent manner that is free of double standards .  
Were the Council to fail to effectively assume its responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security or to contain the volatile situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , we fear that , given the inability of the other parties to achieve concrete progress in prevailing upon the Israeli Government to accept steps that would lead to a political solution , the situation would become yet more tense and would get completely out of control , having a very negative impact on the stability of this vital part of our world .  
This debate has been made necessary by an explosive situation that has followed the exacerbation of violence in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem a perverse sequence of indiscriminate or targeted assassinations , outbursts of anger and extreme and disproportionate retaliatory measures on the part of the Israeli troops , and almost desperate retaliatory actions , to say nothing of heinous acts of opportunism on the part of well-known unrepentant extremists .  
The Supreme Council reviewed the bloody events that have taken place in the occupied Palestinian territories owing to the savage aggression , repressive measures and policies of closure and encirclement directed by Israel against a fraternal Palestinian people seeking the restoration of all of its legitimate rights , including its right to return and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital .  
As far as we , the Palestinian people , are concerned , we believe that this failure also means a failure to contribute to ending the tragedy that has been taking place in the occupied Palestinian territories because of the bloody and oppressive campaign waged against our people by Israel the occupying Power and by the leaders in charge and the current and previous Israeli Prime Ministers Messrs . Sharon and Barak through all their declared and expressed statements and positions that run counter to international law and that call for escalation and confrontation .  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have no legal effect ;

The suffering of Palestinian children caused by Israeli acts of aggression aimed at killing and maiming children , coupled with the lack of facilities to shelter them , Israels abandonment of all values and human rights and its flouting of all international instruments , and its refusal to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to establish a just peace in accordance with the legitimate decisions of the international community , causing heightened suffering among the Arab population under occupation and denying their children all the rights enshrined in the precepts of God and humanitarian law .  
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
As a matter of fact , the Armenian falsifiers conveniently disregard so many facts essential to a humane , spirited , forward-looking and constructive understanding of the tragic events which took place within the fold of a dying and partly occupied country , that as a result , only hatred and rage , unfortunately , govern their general attitude towards the Turks .  
The Ministers expressed their serious concern for the threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia in recent months by ethnic Albanian extremist groups , strongly condemning their terrorist acts and armed violence and calling on these groups to stop their actions , to release the hostages , to lay down their weapons and to withdraw immediately from the occupied areas .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
They urged that Israel should be required to pay reparations for the material losses resulting from its aggression against the occupied Palestinian territories , such as the destruction of urban and rural installations , as well as for the many Palestinian lives that have been lost , the serious wounds that have been inflicted and the permanent disabilities that have been caused , as has been the case in the past when compensation has been paid to victims of aggression in similar cases . 
We have the honour to inform you that at two urgent and successive meetings , the first of the Follow-up Committee of the Ninth Islamic Summit Conference and the second of the Islamic Group , both held yesterday , at the ambassadorial level , grave concern was expressed over the deteriorating situation that has developed in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem .  
As a result of a deliberate policy methodically implemented by Turkey in the occupied areas of Cyprus , the cultural identity of the northern part of the island , which dates back to the seventh millennium BC , is in grave danger of being permanently and completely destroyed .  
In paragraph 32 of its concluding observations on the initial report of Israel , the Committee requested the State party to provide additional information on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights in the occupied territories , in order to complete the State partys initial report and thereby ensure full compliance with its reporting obligations .  
The Committee expresses its deep concern about the State partys continuing gross violations of economic , social and cultural rights in the occupied territories , especially the severe measures adopted by the State party to restrict the movement of civilians between points within and outside the occupied territories , severing their access to food , water , health care , education and work .  
The International Labour Organization ( ILO ) maintained close cooperation with the League of Arab States and particularly with its specialized agency , the Arab Labour Organization ( ALO ) , by conducting joint activities and coordinating work pertaining to issues of common interest to both organizations .  With a view to strengthening cooperation with the League of Arab States , the two organizations signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2000 , with respect to employment in the occupied Palestinian territory .
