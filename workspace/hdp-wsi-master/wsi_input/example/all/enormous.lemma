China has accomplished enormous achievements over the 20 years of liberalized reforms .  China has vaulted into the world 's top ten ranking for total import and export trade volume , well ahead of her position below 30th place in the world prior to liberalized reforms , while dependent foreign trade has reached 40 percent .  
In the face of China 's enormous economic body , abundant resources , large labor force , and vast market , of course we can not ignore China 's competitive potential if its economic reform develops in a sustained and smooth manner .  However , Taiwan will not necessarily lose in the competition .  This is like comparing " a diamond with a tonne of cement " - - which has the greater value ?

Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
Without such a guide , the revolutionary contingent would still be disunited and weak , could hardly realize its objectives as planned , and may even lose their way and digress towards the wrong direction , despite the enormous potentiality to change the current situation and the relatively mature revolutionary situation .  
Patriotism is a banner for mobilizing and motivating the billion Chinese people to struggle in unison , an enormous force for driving society and history forward , and a common spiritual pillar for people of all nationalities .  
As joint operations waged under modern conditions involve a large number of precision-guided weapons , intelligent weapons , as well as the C4ISR system , which serves as " nerves and brains " for different weapons systems and military command systems , concentration of military strength is now increasingly dependent upon a commander 's enormous potential unleashed via an information system , and upon a perfect integration of different weapons systems and information systems .  
Zhang Wannian said that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech stands at a historical , epochal , and strategic high plane , and uses a proletarian politician 's grand boldness of vision and daring combined with superior judgment - - as well as using the profound insight and enormous theoretical courage of a brilliant Marxist - - to carry out a systematic , scientific , and incisive exposition toward a series of significant questions regarding the future prospects and fate of the party and the nation .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech delivered at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China points out the Party 's historical task and objective in the new century and provides a powerful ideological weapon and enormous spiritual driving force that encourages the majority of Party members to live through all kinds of tests and forever maintain the advanced nature of Party members .

The primary force driving Sino-US relations forward is that there are enormous common interests between the two sides on both national and global strategic issues and that these interests far outweigh the differences and contradictions between them .  
China 's positive use of foreign capital has played an enormous role in promoting the national economic growth , precipitating the development of import and export trade , and increasing the number of people having found jobs .  
Fourth , after years of development , the western region has initially possessed the soft environment for attracting foreign investment , and more and more overseas enterprises , having realized the enormous potential for the western development , have come one after another to make investment in the western region .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .

It will become a country that has accomplished modernization on the whole , and the ideal of building a powerful country and bringing prosperity to the people pursued by the kind and upright men will be preliminarily achieved as well .  
As for the so-called administrative monopolies , precisely as analyzed by the scholars of the State Council 's Development Research Center , with the vigorous support by a series of preferential policies by the state and nurtured by enormous investments over a long period of time , China 's rail transport , communications , electric power , coal and gas , running water , and numerous other infrastructure industries grew rapidly , and furthermore they were mainly enterprises invested in by the central or local governments which were operated as institutional monopolies .  
All of this may be both familiar and unfamiliar to each of those who experienced the " Cultural Revolution , " but what is most moving is that , in the face of these frenzied political storms and enormous political pressures , Deng Xiaoping showed himself as a long-tested revolutionary and demonstrated the true qualities of a mature politician .

[ Ellipses as received ] It has been learned that the 5000-member Japanese-Chinese cultural sightseeing group , which visited China on a goodwill mission in May this year , broke the record in both the number and the scale in the history of non-governmental exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese peoples .  Self-evident in this figure of 5000 is the positive attitude adopted by the Japanese government in promoting the China-Japan friendly relations , as well as the enormous enthusiasm displayed by the vast numbers of the Japanese people in plunging themselves into the China-Japan friendship undertaking .  
Xu Qiyao , director of Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department , used five million yuan of public money to support 13 mistresses in what is China 's biggest case involving a senior official in such an immoral affair .

The Jiangsu Provincial Procuratorate recently approved Xu 's arrest and charged him with an enormous amount of crimes that were especially serious and harmful to society .

His conduct constituted crimes of smuggling ordinary goods , accepting bribes , embezzlement , unauthorized partitioning of state-owned assets and possessing large amounts of property of unaccountable origins .  Due to the enormous amount of money involved and the especially serious circumstances , in the judgment of first instance , he was sentenced to death , deprived of political rights for life , and subjected to confiscation of all personal property .  
He pointed out : Despite the complex and changeable situations at home and abroad in the past five years , China has achieved enormous economic and social successes that have attracted world-wide attention , and has triumphantly accomplished the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the second-step objective set for the country 's modernization program .

Ladies and gentlemen , I have enormous faith in our future .  That confidence is not based on wishful thinking .  It 's based on what I have just outlined - a clear understanding of our positioning , and a whole range of initiatives coming on stream over the next few years .  
His first major task became road development . In order to fund the enormous task , Mayor Shu sought a loan from the provincial government . As the standard yearly appropriation for all public construction throughout the island is US $ 72,500,000 , officials of the provincial government were astounded when Mayor Shu requested five times that amount for a single city .  
Besides military work , the large capital investment and cultivation of talent can provide enormous resources for the future development of a complete air industry and for raising the level of domestic industry in general .  
This year local commodity prices , which caused enough complaint before , have been affected by a " bad year " in terms of both natural and man-made disasters . Since the middle of August when Typhoon Yancy struck , Taiwan has weathered typhoons Abe and Dot in quick succession , causing enormous losses in farm produce .  
In particular , with population increasingly packed into urban areas , this creates new opportunities for communicable diseases to spread . " 2,000 Dead from Influenza : Looking back at the history of epidemic illnesses , in the era when medicines were still undeveloped and public hygiene was poor , all kinds of diseases spread by bacteria or virus posed an enormous threat to human life .  
Art as Life : As dusk came over , sacred Tawu Mountain gradually was shrouded and disappeared . In a flash , Sakuliu had manufactured a durable firewall out of flagstones in the front room , and lit an enormous piece of wood using only half a sheet of newspaper , and then in one graceful gesture moved the now-cooled pot of water next to the fire to warm up .  
We reached a particularly steep stretch of the path and my legs grew weary . Only a few slanting rays of sunlight managed to pierce the broad canopies of the enormous trees scattered about both sides of the path - - the forest 's parasol . The world under this living umbrella was a moist and luxuriant green realm of nameless grasses and strange insects that flew up whenever one disturbed them . It was a timeless , carefree world under the care of the mountain .  
Otherwise , if one just adopts the form outright , it could turn out like the Hsiu Lang Elementary School in Yungho : The newly built four story school building is a four-sided ( fully enclosed ) ho-yuan , but because an activities center was added to the courtyard , the school thus became an enormous resonance chamber . The only thing the school could do was to restrict the children from running about , thus contradicting the original spirit of the large communal compound .  
Q : Because the Three Gorges project is extremely complex , there are many different opinions pro and con . Those opposed accuse the political leaders of simply liking grandiose white elephants while ignoring the ecology and the overall interests of the nation . Those who approve say that the dam could resolve the eternal problem of flooding on the Yangtze , and feel that this enormous project would enable the country to become wealthy and strong , creating a chance to do something unparalleled in the world .  
The banks and shoals of the Tsengwen estuary , built up by the accretion of silt over thousands of years , are rich in organic matter and bottomdwelling organisms , and the estuary 's broad intertidal zone , with large-scale aquaculture nearby , provides a safe environment with abundant food , which attracts enormous numbers of migratory birds to rest or over winter here .  
The section chief of the division for agricultural weather forecasts , Liu Fu-cheng , nicknamed " the old turtle , " has known Jen Li-yu for thirty years as classmate , fellow conscript , and colleague . He laughingly commented on the fact that Jen Li-yu was a mild-mannered civil servant , always meek and always humble . But because the timbre of his voice was clear and resonant , far more so than the average , he gained enormous popularity .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
The PRC is an enormous economic unit with the potential for explosive growth . Like a " black hole , " it could absorb and exhaust Taiwanese capital and technology . Further , the political standoff between the two sides has yet to be resolved . Commercial competition may have a complex impact on all this , and should not be seen as a simple economic problem .  
However , the secularized tiger in China with its enormous area and complex ethnic mix naturally gave rise to a multiplicity of different symbolisms , creating apparent contradictions . This is no different from the imaginary dragon , for although the dragon is said to be holy and inviolable for the Chinese , there are also some stories of evil dragons .  
Yinfeng was left with two children less than ten years old . Women in similar situations rushed to remarry in order to meet their daily needs . Fate dictated that not long after the fighting between the Nationalists and Communists stopped , there was an enormous flood , which ruined the just-planted crops .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
To attract followers , such groups employ methods of " intensive instruction , therapy and guidance , an isolated environment , and worship of the religious leader , " which are akin to brainwashing techniques . These cause people to identify with the doctrine and ceremonies of the religion , so that believers fully believe themselves to be acting of their own free will . Yet outsiders find their behavior inexplicable . The end result is tragedy , with society paying enormous costs .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
However , simple watch display chips can not meet the needs of Taiwan 's information industry companies , and Taiwan spends enormous amounts of foreign exchange on dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) , static random access memory ( SRAM ) , central processing units ( CPUs ) and all kinds of other integrated circuits , which are assembled into computers and motherboards for export .  
It continued : " Chinese emperors collected these works over 11 centuries . Some of the pieces predate them-the elaborate wine vessel from the mid-ninth century BC , for example , and the curious reddish bronze vat , or liang , from AD 9 that was intended to enforce a new set of volumetric standards . In complexity , both works are years ahead of their Western equivalents . Nor was there a Western equivalent of the enormous workshops that , in centuries to come , filled these emperors ' warehouses . "  
What private sector publishing firms originally set their sights on was the huge primary school textbook market , which consists of over 300,000 student readers . This , plus the possibility of publishing additional reference materials and teaching aids , adds up to potentially enormous profits . It is the main reason publishers were initally jumping at the chance to get in on the textbook market .  
Chien Chun-an notes that extramarital affairs entail enormous risks . A third party becomes involved in the family life of others , the people having the affair face a moral challenge , and after the most romantic initial stage passes , pressure grows to bring the affair to an end . Having chosen a path of love that is by nature misguided and tragic , it is natural that it leads to serious problems .  
For the whole global village to be improved into an enormous " aseptic chamber " is surely impossible , but what we can predict is that if humans do not change their attitudes towards the environment and nature , and if they continue to pay scant regard to safe practice in medical treatment and the use of drugs , new viruses and infectious diseases will never stop appearing .  
He compares the rage for the beads to the scams involving the charlatan Buddhist master Song Chi-li who sold doctored photographs of light emanating from his head or the enormous sums spent on Buddha pedestals by the Taiqimen sect . " Strange beasts , " he says , " come out during times of social crisis . " Modern people , with their numerous desires , are hard to satisfy and often lack peace and happiness .  
The PRC has an enormous undersea force and has been developing nuclear subs . Meanwhile , Taiwan has only four subs , two of which are re-fitted submarines used by the US in World War II ( they are outdated and useful only for training ) . The current ROC submarine force can not effectively undertake counter blockade missions . Therefore , the purchase of new submarines is urgent .  
With the end of the US-Soviet Cold War , the PRC has recognized that an enormous transformation has occurred in the global political and military structure . Bipolar confrontation has been replaced by regional or functional conflicts . Under these circumstances , middle-sized powers or regional powers can expand their international political influence .  
He recalls how in the 1960s , when Taiwan and mainland China were engaged in a propaganda battle on the airwaves , and listening to mainland broadcasts was forbidden in Taiwan , the government encouraged the establishment of private radio stations . The number of radio stations quickly grew to over 80 , and there was an enormous demand for programs . Father Bourret produced classical music programs , five-minute stories , and short radio dramas , all of which he made available to radio stations free of charge .  
Yueliang-wan became a mecca for archeological research in Sichuan Province . A succession of wars , however , brought archeological work to a halt for many years before experts were finally able to return to Yueliang-wan and Sanxingdui in the 1950s and 60s . The growing number of sites and the enormous collection of jades and pottery that were gradually unearthed in scattered excavations led archeologists to suspect that the area might have been one of the principal cities of southwest China 's Shu kingdom in prehistoric times .  
Filling the open spaces around the Taiwan Museum of Art in Taichung , and crowded onto nearby rooftops , some 20,000 spectators , including over 200 local and international journalists , were waiting for the action-an enormous number given the usual low attendance at art events .  
My parents always felt that a child had to chubby to be healthy . From when I was nine years old , right up until the time I started trying to break into show business , they always stuffed me up nice and plump . At one point I was an enormous 110 kilos . In the past , maybe my friends just thought I was cute , but nobody thought of me as handsome .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
It seems they have n't realized yet that they may live to be 85 . They have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that can be expected over the next 25 years . " She has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success . Indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother .  
Martial arts novels first appeared in the late Qing dynasty , and largely featured fight action . The time and place in which they were set differed little from those in which people at that time lived . But the 20th century brought enormous changes , with dramatic advances in civilization , science , technology and lifestyles , and as a result the setting of the martial arts novel lost its connection with everyday life .  
Although this incident is not related to the ongoing partisan conflict , it has generated an enormous stir in Taiwanese politics . The original political problem of unending discord has consequently become even more complex .  
In the past there was also an enormous difference between the simple content of elementary school courses and the difficult and dry content of junior high school courses . In future , courses will be designed with continuity from first to ninth grade , and there will no longer be such a break between elementary and junior high school .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
There are a dazzling variety of intricately shaped sacred turtle images large and small , with past and present examples that include an enormous rice turtle weighing 8000 Taiwanese catties ( 4800 kg ) , a solid-gold electric turtle made of 230 taels ( about 8.6 kg ) of gold , and " money turtles " made up of stacks of shiny new coins . But whatever the form , all carry the same message : hope for a beautiful life in the new year .  
Three or four old buddies sit around a table munching away , feeling the satisfying warmth spread through their bodies . As the alcohol takes effect , they become happy and excitable . Amidst the noise and chatter , they feel that enormous sense of well-being that comes with crowding around a blazing fire in wintertime . It would be safe to conclude that there is no wintertime " tonic " dish more welcome and more deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture than ginger duck .  
In contrast , the enormous expenses of the two dialysis centers in Malaysia are covered entirely locally by donations from grateful patients and the money raised by local volunteers through small donations and recycling of waste . Wang Yun-ching relates that most people have the mistaken idea that all Tzu Chi volunteers are Buddhists . In fact , those handling medical duties for Tzu Chi branch organizations around the world include persons of many different faiths .  
Part of the problem is that education reform has been conducted without a clear objective , with schemes adopted helter-skelter , and with countless cooks ending up spoiling the broth . Also to blame is the simultaneous and zealous pursuit of globalization and localization by both local and central governments . The result is that the book bags carried by Taiwanese children have become enormous , and the psychological pressure equally weighty .  
Dr . Latifah , participating in the clinic , notes that there are many small islands around Batam , and medical resources , inadequate to begin with , are also scattered . Given the great distance from Jakarta , the political and economic heart of Indonesia , local residents must travel far across the water for treatment . Often minor illnesses are ignored until they become major ones , and patients with serious problems deteriorate over time because they can not afford the enormous costs of seeking treatment .  
But the TCM Clinic finds itself under enormous pressure , because many of its patients present complex symptoms that have proven resistant to Western medicine . Such patients place great hopes in Chinese medicine and set deadlines for positive results . The clinic faces the formidable challenge of improving patients ' condition within three or four weeks of admission .  
The tragic situation being experienced by that fraternal nation is of extreme concern to us , because it is causing us enormous political , economic and social problems .

However , it should not be forgotten that the firm establishment of tolerance was an enormous undertaking which could not be completed in one day and which thus required the united efforts of the entire international community .  
The problems threatening international peace which arouse natural fears , create anxiety , work against the people 's well-being , cause enormous losses of human life and bring about an immense deterioration of social and economic development are no doubt the gravest problems , and they call for action for peace by all means possible . 
After engaging in broad contacts within the system of Asian States , we have once again become convinced of the correctness of the conclusion drawn at the beginning of this century that Asia , with its enormous human , natural and intellectual resources , had every possibility of becoming the most prosperous region in the world .  
We believe that the gap which exists , in the areas of economic growth and social advancement , between the wealthy industrialized countries , with their enormous economic resources , and the developing countries , is among the most chronic and significant problems that face the international community .  
We are confident that a Middle East zone free of nuclear and weapons of mass destruction would enhance the peace process and lead to a situation wherein enormous financial resources would be saved and channelled towards the economic prosperity and social development of the peoples of the region .  
However , our conscience can not rest easy in view of a reality that we can not ignore : the fact that one-fifth of mankind still lives in abject poverty , and the challenges posed by the enormous gap between the annual per capita gross national product for the least developed countries less than $ 200 and that of advanced industrialized countries , which is more than a-hundred times higher . 
Youth represent 18 per cent of the world population , that is , 1.01-billion persons between 15 to 24 years of age ; 84 per cent of these people live in developing countries and represent a challenge within the context of the economic and social crisis that rages in Africa , as well as representing the enormous potential on which the future of our continent is based . 
This is why it is imperative that both exercises should result in a final break with regrettable strategies aimed at turning procedural questions and an accrued demand for reform into prerequisites preventing all possibility of substantive debate about the real stakes and about problems affecting the operational capabilities of the United Nations to realize its enormous potential to support economic and social development in developing countries .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
However , the OECD Social Indicators Programme experienced enormous difficulty in reaching a consensus on the choice of indicators , and the comprehensive survey which was its logical conclusion was never initiated , although similar surveys were set up in a number of countries and many countries currently publish social indicators according to national needs .  
Thus , it was stated that the establishment of an international criminal court , with the subsidiary organs mentioned in article 5 and other infrastructures , would entail an enormous financial outlay which might be an extra burden for developing countries .  
Persons of all categories and walks of life and all ages - peasant farmers executives and militant members of political parties , government agents , medical and paramedical personnel , and lay and religious persons - were killed in atrocious ways in the bloodthirsty madness which caused the people of Burundi enormous suffering and which can not in any way be justified . 
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .

As for the so-called administrative monopolies , precisely as analyzed by the scholars of the State Council 's Development Research Center , with the vigorous support by a series of preferential policies by the state and nurtured by enormous investments over a long period of time , China 's rail transport , communications , electric power , coal and gas , running water , and numerous other infrastructure industries grew rapidly , and furthermore they were mainly enterprises invested in by the central or local governments which were operated as institutional monopolies .  
All of this may be both familiar and unfamiliar to each of those who experienced the " Cultural Revolution , " but what is most moving is that , in the face of these frenzied political storms and enormous political pressures , Deng Xiaoping showed himself as a long-tested revolutionary and demonstrated the true qualities of a mature politician .  
At the same time , both sides unanimously agreed that there are enormous potential and good prospects for trade and economic cooperation between the two countries and the trade and economic cooperation should be further expanded on the basis of equality and mutual benefit so that they will reach a level commensurate with the economic potential of the two countries .

He said that an important issue much emphasized in the new Five-Year Plan China has formulated is developing science and technology , because scientific and technological advance is an enormous motivation to promote the various undertakings of the state , enhance the overall national strength , and improve people 's living standard .  
[ Ellipses as received ] It has been learned that the 5000-member Japanese-Chinese cultural sightseeing group , which visited China on a goodwill mission in May this year , broke the record in both the number and the scale in the history of non-governmental exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese peoples .  Self-evident in this figure of 5000 is the positive attitude adopted by the Japanese government in promoting the China-Japan friendly relations , as well as the enormous enthusiasm displayed by the vast numbers of the Japanese people in plunging themselves into the China-Japan friendship undertaking .  
Xu Qiyao , director of Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department , used five million yuan of public money to support 13 mistresses in what is China 's biggest case involving a senior official in such an immoral affair .  In addition , Xu received more than 10 million yuan in bribes .  The Jiangsu Provincial Procuratorate recently approved Xu 's arrest and charged him with an enormous amount of crimes that were especially serious and harmful to society .  
Their common goals are : Actively explore China 's enormous market , strive hard to bring China into the world economic and international political systems dominated by the West , use the game rules formulated by Western countries , which are led by the United States , to restrain China , maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait , prevent armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait , strengthen ties with regional allies , and step up the efforts to contain and guard against China in the security domain .  
His conduct constituted crimes of smuggling ordinary goods , accepting bribes , embezzlement , unauthorized partitioning of state-owned assets and possessing large amounts of property of unaccountable origins .  Due to the enormous amount of money involved and the especially serious circumstances , in the judgment of first instance , he was sentenced to death , deprived of political rights for life , and subjected to confiscation of all personal property .  
He pointed out : Despite the complex and changeable situations at home and abroad in the past five years , China has achieved enormous economic and social successes that have attracted world-wide attention , and has triumphantly accomplished the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the second-step objective set for the country 's modernization program .  
Hong Kong has long been the international maritime capital of Asia . Not only is its excellent location supported by world-class communications , transport and financial services , but coupled with an enormous pool of experienced professionals in shipping affairs , Hong Kong is the ideal place for settling arbitration disputes .  
" They have brought their enormous creativity into full play , centering around optimization of living space and building efficiency , integration of technological and environmental concepts , and harmonization with physical environment , " Dr Cheng said , adding that the innovative ideas had rightly set a new direction for public housing development and were extremely valuable for future reference .  
Ladies and gentlemen , I have enormous faith in our future .  That confidence is not based on wishful thinking .  It 's based on what I have just outlined - a clear understanding of our positioning , and a whole range of initiatives coming on stream over the next few years .  
His first major task became road development . In order to fund the enormous task , Mayor Shu sought a loan from the provincial government . As the standard yearly appropriation for all public construction throughout the island is US $ 72,500,000 , officials of the provincial government were astounded when Mayor Shu requested five times that amount for a single city .  
Besides military work , the large capital investment and cultivation of talent can provide enormous resources for the future development of a complete air industry and for raising the level of domestic industry in general .  
This year local commodity prices , which caused enough complaint before , have been affected by a " bad year " in terms of both natural and man-made disasters . Since the middle of August when Typhoon Yancy struck , Taiwan has weathered typhoons Abe and Dot in quick succession , causing enormous losses in farm produce .  
In particular , with population increasingly packed into urban areas , this creates new opportunities for communicable diseases to spread . " 2,000 Dead from Influenza : Looking back at the history of epidemic illnesses , in the era when medicines were still undeveloped and public hygiene was poor , all kinds of diseases spread by bacteria or virus posed an enormous threat to human life .  
Art as Life : As dusk came over , sacred Tawu Mountain gradually was shrouded and disappeared . In a flash , Sakuliu had manufactured a durable firewall out of flagstones in the front room , and lit an enormous piece of wood using only half a sheet of newspaper , and then in one graceful gesture moved the now-cooled pot of water next to the fire to warm up .  
We reached a particularly steep stretch of the path and my legs grew weary . Only a few slanting rays of sunlight managed to pierce the broad canopies of the enormous trees scattered about both sides of the path - - the forest 's parasol . The world under this living umbrella was a moist and luxuriant green realm of nameless grasses and strange insects that flew up whenever one disturbed them . It was a timeless , carefree world under the care of the mountain .  
Otherwise , if one just adopts the form outright , it could turn out like the Hsiu Lang Elementary School in Yungho : The newly built four story school building is a four-sided ( fully enclosed ) ho-yuan , but because an activities center was added to the courtyard , the school thus became an enormous resonance chamber . The only thing the school could do was to restrict the children from running about , thus contradicting the original spirit of the large communal compound .  
Q : Because the Three Gorges project is extremely complex , there are many different opinions pro and con . Those opposed accuse the political leaders of simply liking grandiose white elephants while ignoring the ecology and the overall interests of the nation . Those who approve say that the dam could resolve the eternal problem of flooding on the Yangtze , and feel that this enormous project would enable the country to become wealthy and strong , creating a chance to do something unparalleled in the world .  
The banks and shoals of the Tsengwen estuary , built up by the accretion of silt over thousands of years , are rich in organic matter and bottomdwelling organisms , and the estuary 's broad intertidal zone , with large-scale aquaculture nearby , provides a safe environment with abundant food , which attracts enormous numbers of migratory birds to rest or over winter here .  
The section chief of the division for agricultural weather forecasts , Liu Fu-cheng , nicknamed " the old turtle , " has known Jen Li-yu for thirty years as classmate , fellow conscript , and colleague . He laughingly commented on the fact that Jen Li-yu was a mild-mannered civil servant , always meek and always humble . But because the timbre of his voice was clear and resonant , far more so than the average , he gained enormous popularity .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
The PRC is an enormous economic unit with the potential for explosive growth . Like a " black hole , " it could absorb and exhaust Taiwanese capital and technology . Further , the political standoff between the two sides has yet to be resolved . Commercial competition may have a complex impact on all this , and should not be seen as a simple economic problem .  
However , the secularized tiger in China with its enormous area and complex ethnic mix naturally gave rise to a multiplicity of different symbolisms , creating apparent contradictions . This is no different from the imaginary dragon , for although the dragon is said to be holy and inviolable for the Chinese , there are also some stories of evil dragons .  
Yinfeng was left with two children less than ten years old . Women in similar situations rushed to remarry in order to meet their daily needs . Fate dictated that not long after the fighting between the Nationalists and Communists stopped , there was an enormous flood , which ruined the just-planted crops .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
To attract followers , such groups employ methods of " intensive instruction , therapy and guidance , an isolated environment , and worship of the religious leader , " which are akin to brainwashing techniques . These cause people to identify with the doctrine and ceremonies of the religion , so that believers fully believe themselves to be acting of their own free will . Yet outsiders find their behavior inexplicable . The end result is tragedy , with society paying enormous costs .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
However , simple watch display chips can not meet the needs of Taiwan 's information industry companies , and Taiwan spends enormous amounts of foreign exchange on dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) , static random access memory ( SRAM ) , central processing units ( CPUs ) and all kinds of other integrated circuits , which are assembled into computers and motherboards for export .  
It continued : " Chinese emperors collected these works over 11 centuries . Some of the pieces predate them-the elaborate wine vessel from the mid-ninth century BC , for example , and the curious reddish bronze vat , or liang , from AD 9 that was intended to enforce a new set of volumetric standards . In complexity , both works are years ahead of their Western equivalents . Nor was there a Western equivalent of the enormous workshops that , in centuries to come , filled these emperors ' warehouses . "  
What private sector publishing firms originally set their sights on was the huge primary school textbook market , which consists of over 300,000 student readers . This , plus the possibility of publishing additional reference materials and teaching aids , adds up to potentially enormous profits . It is the main reason publishers were initally jumping at the chance to get in on the textbook market .  
Chien Chun-an notes that extramarital affairs entail enormous risks . A third party becomes involved in the family life of others , the people having the affair face a moral challenge , and after the most romantic initial stage passes , pressure grows to bring the affair to an end . Having chosen a path of love that is by nature misguided and tragic , it is natural that it leads to serious problems .  
For the whole global village to be improved into an enormous " aseptic chamber " is surely impossible , but what we can predict is that if humans do not change their attitudes towards the environment and nature , and if they continue to pay scant regard to safe practice in medical treatment and the use of drugs , new viruses and infectious diseases will never stop appearing .  
He compares the rage for the beads to the scams involving the charlatan Buddhist master Song Chi-li who sold doctored photographs of light emanating from his head or the enormous sums spent on Buddha pedestals by the Taiqimen sect . " Strange beasts , " he says , " come out during times of social crisis . " Modern people , with their numerous desires , are hard to satisfy and often lack peace and happiness .  
The PRC has an enormous undersea force and has been developing nuclear subs . Meanwhile , Taiwan has only four subs , two of which are re-fitted submarines used by the US in World War II ( they are outdated and useful only for training ) . The current ROC submarine force can not effectively undertake counter blockade missions . Therefore , the purchase of new submarines is urgent .  
With the end of the US-Soviet Cold War , the PRC has recognized that an enormous transformation has occurred in the global political and military structure . Bipolar confrontation has been replaced by regional or functional conflicts . Under these circumstances , middle-sized powers or regional powers can expand their international political influence .  
He recalls how in the 1960s , when Taiwan and mainland China were engaged in a propaganda battle on the airwaves , and listening to mainland broadcasts was forbidden in Taiwan , the government encouraged the establishment of private radio stations . The number of radio stations quickly grew to over 80 , and there was an enormous demand for programs . Father Bourret produced classical music programs , five-minute stories , and short radio dramas , all of which he made available to radio stations free of charge .  
Yueliang-wan became a mecca for archeological research in Sichuan Province . A succession of wars , however , brought archeological work to a halt for many years before experts were finally able to return to Yueliang-wan and Sanxingdui in the 1950s and 60s . The growing number of sites and the enormous collection of jades and pottery that were gradually unearthed in scattered excavations led archeologists to suspect that the area might have been one of the principal cities of southwest China 's Shu kingdom in prehistoric times .  
Filling the open spaces around the Taiwan Museum of Art in Taichung , and crowded onto nearby rooftops , some 20,000 spectators , including over 200 local and international journalists , were waiting for the action-an enormous number given the usual low attendance at art events .  
My parents always felt that a child had to chubby to be healthy . From when I was nine years old , right up until the time I started trying to break into show business , they always stuffed me up nice and plump . At one point I was an enormous 110 kilos . In the past , maybe my friends just thought I was cute , but nobody thought of me as handsome .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .

" She has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success . Indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother .  
Martial arts novels first appeared in the late Qing dynasty , and largely featured fight action . The time and place in which they were set differed little from those in which people at that time lived . But the 20th century brought enormous changes , with dramatic advances in civilization , science , technology and lifestyles , and as a result the setting of the martial arts novel lost its connection with everyday life .  
Although this incident is not related to the ongoing partisan conflict , it has generated an enormous stir in Taiwanese politics . The original political problem of unending discord has consequently become even more complex .  
In the past there was also an enormous difference between the simple content of elementary school courses and the difficult and dry content of junior high school courses . In future , courses will be designed with continuity from first to ninth grade , and there will no longer be such a break between elementary and junior high school .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .

But whatever the form , all carry the same message : hope for a beautiful life in the new year .  
Three or four old buddies sit around a table munching away , feeling the satisfying warmth spread through their bodies . As the alcohol takes effect , they become happy and excitable . Amidst the noise and chatter , they feel that enormous sense of well-being that comes with crowding around a blazing fire in wintertime . It would be safe to conclude that there is no wintertime " tonic " dish more welcome and more deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture than ginger duck .  
In contrast , the enormous expenses of the two dialysis centers in Malaysia are covered entirely locally by donations from grateful patients and the money raised by local volunteers through small donations and recycling of waste . Wang Yun-ching relates that most people have the mistaken idea that all Tzu Chi volunteers are Buddhists . In fact , those handling medical duties for Tzu Chi branch organizations around the world include persons of many different faiths .  
Part of the problem is that education reform has been conducted without a clear objective , with schemes adopted helter-skelter , and with countless cooks ending up spoiling the broth . Also to blame is the simultaneous and zealous pursuit of globalization and localization by both local and central governments . The result is that the book bags carried by Taiwanese children have become enormous , and the psychological pressure equally weighty .  
Dr . Latifah , participating in the clinic , notes that there are many small islands around Batam , and medical resources , inadequate to begin with , are also scattered . Given the great distance from Jakarta , the political and economic heart of Indonesia , local residents must travel far across the water for treatment . Often minor illnesses are ignored until they become major ones , and patients with serious problems deteriorate over time because they can not afford the enormous costs of seeking treatment .  
But the TCM Clinic finds itself under enormous pressure , because many of its patients present complex symptoms that have proven resistant to Western medicine .

Youth represent 18 per cent of the world population , that is , 1.01-billion persons between 15 to 24 years of age ; 84 per cent of these people live in developing countries and represent a challenge within the context of the economic and social crisis that rages in Africa , as well as representing the enormous potential on which the future of our continent is based . 
This is why it is imperative that both exercises should result in a final break with regrettable strategies aimed at turning procedural questions and an accrued demand for reform into prerequisites preventing all possibility of substantive debate about the real stakes and about problems affecting the operational capabilities of the United Nations to realize its enormous potential to support economic and social development in developing countries .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .
