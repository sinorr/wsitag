By resolution 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , the General Assembly decided that the governing body of the United Nations Children 's Fund should be transformed into an Executive Board , and that the Executive Board should have 36 members , to be elected with due regard to equitable geographical representation and other relevant factors with a view to ensuring the most effective and broadest representation .  
The requested oral report on the status of an interregional workshop to formulate a pilot project ( for an appropriate region ) which should develop standard approaches to the identification and qualitative assessment of permissive tracts and be based on geographical information system technology , that would allow integration with other land management information will not be presented due to the current financial situation of the United Nations , which has prevented the workshop from being financed and prepared . 
With the aim of providing high-quality technical support services to countries , some agencies have identified focal points on gender in their country teams and geographical divisions to monitor the mainstreaming of gender issues at the national and regional levels , as well as at the global level .  
Maintenance of " old habits " is reinforced , in addition to spiritual and cultural traditions , through a low level of social and geographical mobility , strong social control exerted by communities and - paradoxically - the socialist system enforcing uniformity in society .  
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
No one fully knows how deep and friendly are the relations that link the Egyptian people with the Sudanese people : their ties are as old as the Nile , are enhanced by geographical proximity , neighbourly relations , a common language , the similarity of their social customs and the human relations between the two peoples in the Nile valley since time immemorial .  
The objectives of the AEQM Plan are to analyse the specific impact of productive activity on all environmental systems in a given geographical space ; to assess the assimilative capacity of those systems ; and based on these two technical assessments , to establish a set of environmental priorities and action plans to improve environmental quality and reduce the adverse environmental impact on air , water and land resources .  
In accordance with Council resolution 1985 / 17 , the Committee has 18 members who are experts with recognized competence in the field of human rights , serving in their personal capacity , due consideration being given to equitable geographical distribution and to the representation of different forms of social and legal systems ; to this end , 15 seats are equally distributed among the regional groups , while the additional 3 seats are allocated in accordance with the increase in the total number of States parties per regional group .  
However , terrorism was not confined to certain countries or regions ; it posed a serious threat to all countries , regardless of their military power , economic development and geographical location , and therefore required a concerted international response .  
The survey produced written and oral responses from individuals and delegations covering well over half of the total 232 indigenous participants at the Working Group session , reflecting their geographical diversity and a broad range of experience of the United Nations system .  
He stated that none of the criteria used to define ethnic groups or national minorities were applicable to Burundi , since for centuries Hutus and Tutsis had occupied the same geographical area , shared the same religious beliefs and spoken the same language .  
While it was gratifying to note that the percentage of women in posts subject to geographical distribution had risen by 1 per cent over the past year , his delegation was concerned that , because of the financial crisis , it had been difficult for the Organization to meet its targets for the percentage of women in decision-making and policy-making posts .  
Permanent membership for these regions should be considered not only in order to ensure equitable geographical distribution , but also because countries from these regions have significant political and economic influence and have played a constructive role in international affairs , including peacekeeping .  
Under those definitions , a Member State was considered to be adequately represented if the number of its nationals employed in the Secretariat on posts subject to geographical distribution fell within the desirable range as defined by the General Assembly itself .  
At a time when profound changes are taking place in the international arena and the United Nations is being increasingly called upon to face new challenges that are not always conciliatory and require the concerted efforts of all Member States , regardless of size , geographical situation or economic and military might , it is vital that a broad programme of comprehensive reform of the multilateral institutions be adopted to further measures , in a decisive manner , for the democratization of international relations based on the rule of law and the mutual benefit of States .  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
It is therefore the humble submission of my country that , based on the United Nations principles of the sovereign equality of all its Members , of universality of membership , and of equitable geographical representation , the South Pacific region , which includes the island nations along with Australia and New Zealand , should be recognized as a geopolitical region for the purpose of regional representation and membership of the Security Council .  
My delegation believes that our proposals on the size of the permanent membership and on the size and geographical composition of the non-permanent membership are a material and proper approach to the reform of the Security Council if the Council is to continue to have credibility as an institution which is representative of the international community as a whole and which therefore has the legal and moral authority to act on its behalf .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
Like other members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , his country supported the concept of a rapidly deployable headquarters team and emphasized the importance of such a team being set up in a transparent manner , bearing in mind the multilateral character of the Organization and the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations as it pertained to the independence of the staff and to equitable geographical distribution . 
Notwithstanding their valuable contributions to the United Nations , loaned officers were not a substitute for an independent international civil service that reflected as wide a geographical distribution as possible .  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
The following table and chart show the proportion of fixed-term appointments to career appointments , including permanent and probationary , for staff subject to equitable geographical distribution , over a six-year period . 8 It is noted that , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 49 / 222 A , the Secretary-General has sustained the ratio between career and fixed-term appointments since 1994 , with minor variations . 
The Special Committee also noted the significant work accomplished by personnel provided by some Member States on loan to the Organization , including in specialized areas essential to support of peacekeeping operations , and requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the recruitment and use of loaned personnel was consistent with the requirements of Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations , including that due regard be paid to wide geographical representation .  
In the composition of subsidiary organs , emphasis shall be placed on the need for members qualified and competent in relevant technical matters dealt with by those organs , provided that due account shall be taken of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and of special interests .  
In fact , the concept is embedded in the FAO Constitution , Article VII , paragraph 3 , which states : " In appointing the staff , the Director-General shall , subject to the paramount importance of securing the highest standards of efficiency and technical competence , pay due regard to the importance of selecting personnel recruitment on as wide a geographical basis as possible " .  NULLA member State 's representation is determined directly by its contribution to the regular budget .  
The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .  
" Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
It was hard to reconcile calls made by delegations for equitable geographical distribution with a situation in which the vast majority of staff members , including many whose professional qualifications did not meet the high standards of the international civil service , enjoyed permanent status .  
This data will be utilized by OHRM 's human resources planning specialist to project external recruitment needs sufficiently in advance as to allow National Competitive Examinations to target occupational groupings of staff to meet the current and anticipated2 needs of the Organization , while addressing as well equitable geographical distribution concerns .  
This is intended to lead to more rational , transparent and effective recruitment , placement and promotion strategies that take into account existing staff profiles and potential , and target recruitment and staff development needs to take into account , in particular , equitable geographical distribution and gender balance requirements .  
[ Urged ] [ ( iv ) Urging ] Governments to promote digital mapping ( using geographical information systems ( GIS ) and global positioning systems ( GPS ) combined with social mapping for establishing forest holdings and values ; assisting planning and management partnerships ; and assisting in the [ location of cultural and ] [ storage of ] geographical information required to support [ sustainable forest management schemes ; ] [ the management , protection and use of TFRK ] ;

PASHAYEV ( Azerbaijan ) said that drug abuse , illegal drug trafficking and crime were increasing at alarming rates and had serious political , economic and social implications for countries , particularly the newly independent States , which had been confronted with problems resulting from aggression , large numbers of refugees and displaced persons , economies in transition and a geographical situation favourable to drug dealers .  
We make this statement for the sake of the record of this institution , which was established for the attainment of the goals and ideals reflected in its Charter , maintains its neutrality , supports peoples ' will and is based on the principles of sovereign equality of all States , irrespective of their size , geographical location and military or economic potentialities .  
While proximity to the countries is a definite advantage in developing geographical specialization - something difficult to achieve by entities outside the region - the marked heterogeneity among the countries of the ESCAP region calls for special skills , localized knowledge , and competence for adopting , whenever required , a case-by-case approach .  
The rich variety of geographical , ethnic , cultural and linguistic origins within the staff of the Commission has served , as I intended , to centre and balance the work of the secretariat to meet the required high standards of independence , effectiveness and impartiality , which are expected from a United Nations operation .  
These tasks are also dictated by the increase in the membership of the Organization , by the full application of the principles of sovereign equality and equitable geographical representation based on the Organization 's universal nature , and by the recognition that the United Nations remains a viable alternative for Member States .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,

Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
In accordance with article III of the statute of the Institute , the Board of Trustees is composed of 11 members nominated by States and appointed by the Economic and Social Council , with due regard to the fact that the Institute and its work are funded from voluntary contributions and to the principle of equitable geographical distribution .  
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,

Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
This Union will enable all Central American social sectors to take full advantage of the region 's strategic geographical location , economic potential , vast ecological wealth and robust and abundant human resources within the new international order , and to confront the challenges of the next millennium .  
With its unique nature , its special mandate and its open-ended composition it could contribute greatly to the process of restructuring the Organization , giving an enhanced role to the General Assembly as the most representative body and increasing the representativeness of the Security Council by expanding the participation of developing countries , in conformity with the principle of sovereign equality as well as equitable geographical representation .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme to secure representation of the major legal systems and to ensure balance among various geographical regions .  
Newly emerging phenomena , such as the possibility of long-term climate change with the expectation of disastrous effects on a global scale or , better known , periodic seasonal or geographical anomalies such as the El Ni �� Southern Oscillation phenomenon , create further uncertainties and new challenges for institutionalized warning practices .  
It was imperative that the international criminal court should be an organ that was universally accepted by all the principal legal systems as well as all the major geographical regions of the world so as to ensure its effectiveness and authority .  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
As outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the report of the Secretary-General , adjustments would need to be made to the Mission 's staffing and regional deployment during the biennium 1998-1999 in order to strengthen its capacity to coordinate its work , attract and retain highly qualified staff , ensure an adequate geographical coverage of the country and address all the substantive areas of verification in compliance with its mandate and ensure adequate liaison with other international institutions and bodies .

The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
The formula based on geographical representation shifts the emphasis of the entire reform process towards a replacement of the former ideologized bipolar world by a new bipolarity of North-South , which runs counter to a balanced perception of the objectives which have been laid out , which take into account the interests of all geographic regions .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
While we consider counterproductive the ambition to expand the geographical frontiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and while we attach particular importance to efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the territory of foreign military bases in order to limit nuclear arsenals to the territory of the nuclear States , we are also ready to hold consultations on building a balanced system of relations between Belarus and that important military bloc and to work for political , military and strategic equilibrium with all our partners .  
Article 76 of the Convention requires that information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
The Sub-Commission considered that it would be useful for the Commission to establish , for a three _ year period , a Working Group composed of five experts nominated by Governments , to be appointed by the Chairman of the Commission at its fifty _ third session on the basis of equitable geographical representation and in consultation with the regional groups in the Commission , with the following mandate :  
Its cultural and linguistic ties with both the United States and Europe , its geographical proximity to the United States mainland and its weak institutional structures contribute to the continued use of the Caribbean subregion as a major transit point in international drug trafficking .  
Among the principles underlying the current methodology for calculating equitable geographical distribution are broad agreements regarding the desirability of relating the base figure to the actual number of posts subject to geographical distribution ; the inclusion of posts based on the population factor in the ranges allocated to Member States ; and the need for flexibility upwards and downwards from the mid-point of each Member State 's range .  
The present report limits itself to a selection of human activities that are : ( a ) not gravely hazardous to the environment if carried out over a limited period of time but are cumulative and hazardous if undertaken on a continued basis ; ( b ) undertaken occasionally and / or involve a potential risk of major contamination within a given geographical area and time-frame .  4 .  The report , however , does not provide a comprehensive analysis of environmental impacts of activities that are gravely hazardous to the environment .  
Where the outer limits of the national jurisdiction of a State Party are defined by the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone , the United Nations shall provide to the Authority copies of such lists of geographical coordinates or , to the extent practicable , charts , indicating the outer limit lines of the exclusive economic zone of such State Party as may be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations pursuant to article 75 , paragraph 2 , of the Convention .  
Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .

In the inter-agency follow-up to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 56 of 28 July 1995 , agencies agreed that a lead agency might be designated to carry out the functions of operational coordination for a specific target group , geographical area or technical sector ; and that the lead agency would be accountable to the resident / humanitarian coordinator . 
Moreover , as stated in paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General 's report , adjustments to the Mission 's staffing and regional deployment are proposed during 1998-1999 " in order to strengthen its capacity to coordinate its work , attract and retain highly qualified staff , ensure an adequate geographical coverage of the country , address all the substantive areas of verification in compliance with its mandate and ensure adequate liaison with other international institutions and bodies " .

Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
Where the outer limits of the national jurisdiction of a State Party are defined by the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone , the United Nations shall provide to the Authority copies of such lists of geographical coordinates or , to the extent practicable , charts , indicating the outer limit lines of the exclusive economic zone of such State Party as may be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations pursuant to article 75 , paragraph 2 , of the Convention .  
In conclusion , since environmental concerns found expression in diametrically opposite ways depending on economic situations and the geographical location of the countries concerned , efforts by the international community would become effective only when there was an emphasis on the human dimension of the consequences of environmental changes , which should be fully reflected in the post-1997 phase of implementation of Agenda 21 . 
In addition to the exodus from the countryside and chaotic urbanization , problems common to all developing countries , Lebanon encountered other difficulties : the destruction of housing and infrastructure ; the collapse of economic and cultural institutions ; the displacement of more than 100,000 families ; an unbalanced geographical distribution of the population ; a rise in unemployment ; the devastation of arable land ; stagnation in industry , tourism and commerce ; frequent human rights violations ; a breakdown of social and moral values ; growing drug use ; and increasing juvenile crime . 
These mechanisms consist , among others , of annual financial reports , semi-annual reports , quarterly reports , audited reports by internal and external auditors , field visits by agency personnel , regular monitoring by geographical desks , narrative reports on progress , regular operational reporting and meetings , as well as mid-term and final reports on activities and finance ( see table 6 below ) . 
Even though there was a decrease of 1.8 per cent in the overall percentage of promotions of women in posts subject to geographical distribution , the percentage of promotions for women at the D-1 and P-5 levels has increased considerably as compared with the previous year , thus increasing the pool of women eligible for promotion to senior decision-making levels in the near future .  
Other findings included continued recruitment from a narrow geographical base with apparently no attempt to diversify recruitment sources as prescribed by existing policies , finalization of special service agreements during or even after the consultancy in many cases and high consultancy fees .  
The operating model utilized depends mainly upon the technological sophistication of the local exporter and trade services communities which in turn depends on the general development stage , geographical size and logistical constraints of the local market .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
On this point some delegations expressed preference for a framework convention , arguing that States would be bound by the provisions of such an instrument without losing the freedom to conclude more detailed bilateral or multilateral agreements with respect to specific hazardous or harmful activities or geographical regions with a high concentration of such activities .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Table 2 : OHCHR staff members in the Professional and above category , by nationality , grade and gender , falling under the following categories , as of 31 December 1998 : ( i ) temporary staff in the Professional and above categories holding appointments of less than one year ( not subject to geographical distribution ) ; ( ii ) staff employed as technical cooperation personnel ; and ( iii ) staff specifically appointed for mission service .

Good social welfare systems offer lifetime security , and geographical remoteness has spared people fierce economic competition from other countries of the world . As a result , Australians and New Zealanders are leisurely and carefree , but their economic growth has been rather slow . Their leading exports are still agricultural and mining products , and they rely on imports for most industrial and manufactured products .  
The formation of culture is strongly influenced by geographical factors , " says Tsai Hsiang-hui , an associate professor of history at the Chinese Culture University who serves as a trustee to the cultural foundation in Peikang . " The significance of local cultural and educational foundations lies in bringing together people from the same area , sharing similar customs and backgrounds , to show their concern for local culture . If we are n't elementary school classmates , we may be distant cousins .  
Usually found in the temperate zone , most of them were brought from abroad by migratory birds like the quillwort and the Sparganium fallax . Their taking root in the subtropical environment of Taiwan has greatly startled international botanists . Among them are plants found at their southern most geographical limit : The Nuphar shimadai is especially noteworthy because it belongs to temperate zone family of water plants found mostly in North America and the northern parts of the Eurasian land mass .  
What Lin calls " knowing the earth " involves becoming familiar with different geographical environments .

Swatting a fly with a hammerThe ingredients for Chinese medicine are taken from the natural world , and are limited by such factors as geographical spread . Unlike the supply of Western medicine , which is determined by factory production , the supply for Chinese medicine is not stable . Supply problems for ingredients used in Chinese medicine are nothing new , but over several thousand years , numerous plants have been found to have similar effects to those in short store .  
In those days , because of geographical factors , northern and southern Taiwan developed distinct varieties of settlement . On the wide , flat plains of southern Taiwan , villages basically massed together . In the mountainous north , settlement was spread out among many little villages .  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
Due to Taiwan 's unique geographical position and diverse alpine terrain , as well as the numerous avenues for the immigration of new species-including transport by ocean currents , settlement by migratory birds , the mass migration of species during the ice age when Taiwan and the Chinese mainland were connected-the high level of biodiversity on the island greatly exceeds that of any other place on Earth .  
Changhua City has a long history , but now it seems to have hit a wall , unable to get beyond its current population level or its geographical limitations , stuck running second to Taichung . But the past was different . Old Changhua once held the spotlight , especially its train station . A popular rest stop in the long north-south train journey , the station made a huge impression on all who visited it , and was the pride of Changhua .  
Helanshan Mountain , extending more than 250 kilometers to the north and south , is situated in the border area of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia , two large autonomous regions .  It is an important natural and geographical border , a water resource conservation forest and a natural ecological defense for the attacks of Tenggeli desert and Siberia cold wave .  
The Helan Mountain Range , about 250 kilometers long , extends from south to north along the common border of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia .

This is what strikes me , as I now appear for the first time before so distinguished a forum to speak on behalf of a country such as mine a country with a modest economy , a small population , a territory that is medium-sized but which , owing to its excellent geographical situation , developed more than others ; a culture of social freedom , of mixed races and of political independence , achieved by means of an epic struggle , not only for itself but for all of its American neighbours . 
Though this sense of equality was repressed for three centuries by pragmatic measures that were respected but not implemented , and by the extreme zeal of monks who consulted no one in imposing a single faith on this immense geographical area , it was imbued with the spaciousness of the land , the rivers , the forests , the gentle climate , the mountains and prairies , whose influence produced a different type of human character .  
We are also of the view that additional permanent members should be chosen on the basis , not only of equitable geographical representation , but also of such objective criteria as the political , economic and demographic weight of a country , its capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and its commitment to assume the responsibilities inherent in permanent membership .  
The desire expressed by the Members of the United Nations to enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council will become reality if we make the Council as representative an organ as possible , reflecting the universal character of the United Nations and including within it the greatest possible variety of interests and views , and if we adopt , as guiding principles to that end , those of the sovereign equality of States and of equitable geographical distribution , as provided in the Charter .

The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) , UNEP and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) organized their second training course on environmental law and policy ( March / April 1995 ) , designed to familiarize 30 government lawyers and officials from all geographical regions with the provisions of major environmental instruments , and to compose national legislative strategies for implementing relevant conventions .  
The Workshop was composed of qualified academic and governmental lawyers in their personal capacities , taking into account geographical representation ; and was based on the premise that , in moving towards sustainable development , international environmental law is inspiring new and innovative concepts , principles and ideas , and developing facilitative and enabling mechanisms and procedures in areas such as implementation and compliance and dispute avoidance and settlement .

43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
The normalization of the political situation , the restoration of mutual trust and the creation of viable mechanisms for ensuring lasting peace , stability and security are essential if these riches are to be used with maximum effectiveness for the benefit of all the peoples and all inhabitants of our region , and the advantageous transport and geographical conditions are to be fully exploited .

Maintenance of " old habits " is reinforced , in addition to spiritual and cultural traditions , through a low level of social and geographical mobility , strong social control exerted by communities and - paradoxically - the socialist system enforcing uniformity in society .  
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
No one fully knows how deep and friendly are the relations that link the Egyptian people with the Sudanese people : their ties are as old as the Nile , are enhanced by geographical proximity , neighbourly relations , a common language , the similarity of their social customs and the human relations between the two peoples in the Nile valley since time immemorial .  
The objectives of the AEQM Plan are to analyse the specific impact of productive activity on all environmental systems in a given geographical space ; to assess the assimilative capacity of those systems ; and based on these two technical assessments , to establish a set of environmental priorities and action plans to improve environmental quality and reduce the adverse environmental impact on air , water and land resources .  
In accordance with Council resolution 1985 / 17 , the Committee has 18 members who are experts with recognized competence in the field of human rights , serving in their personal capacity , due consideration being given to equitable geographical distribution and to the representation of different forms of social and legal systems ; to this end , 15 seats are equally distributed among the regional groups , while the additional 3 seats are allocated in accordance with the increase in the total number of States parties per regional group .

While it was gratifying to note that the percentage of women in posts subject to geographical distribution had risen by 1 per cent over the past year , his delegation was concerned that , because of the financial crisis , it had been difficult for the Organization to meet its targets for the percentage of women in decision-making and policy-making posts .  
Permanent membership for these regions should be considered not only in order to ensure equitable geographical distribution , but also because countries from these regions have significant political and economic influence and have played a constructive role in international affairs , including peacekeeping .  
Under those definitions , a Member State was considered to be adequately represented if the number of its nationals employed in the Secretariat on posts subject to geographical distribution fell within the desirable range as defined by the General Assembly itself .  
At a time when profound changes are taking place in the international arena and the United Nations is being increasingly called upon to face new challenges that are not always conciliatory and require the concerted efforts of all Member States , regardless of size , geographical situation or economic and military might , it is vital that a broad programme of comprehensive reform of the multilateral institutions be adopted to further measures , in a decisive manner , for the democratization of international relations based on the rule of law and the mutual benefit of States .  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
It is therefore the humble submission of my country that , based on the United Nations principles of the sovereign equality of all its Members , of universality of membership , and of equitable geographical representation , the South Pacific region , which includes the island nations along with Australia and New Zealand , should be recognized as a geopolitical region for the purpose of regional representation and membership of the Security Council .  
My delegation believes that our proposals on the size of the permanent membership and on the size and geographical composition of the non-permanent membership are a material and proper approach to the reform of the Security Council if the Council is to continue to have credibility as an institution which is representative of the international community as a whole and which therefore has the legal and moral authority to act on its behalf .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .

The following table and chart show the proportion of fixed-term appointments to career appointments , including permanent and probationary , for staff subject to equitable geographical distribution , over a six-year period . 8 It is noted that , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 49 / 222 A , the Secretary-General has sustained the ratio between career and fixed-term appointments since 1994 , with minor variations . 
The Special Committee also noted the significant work accomplished by personnel provided by some Member States on loan to the Organization , including in specialized areas essential to support of peacekeeping operations , and requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the recruitment and use of loaned personnel was consistent with the requirements of Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations , including that due regard be paid to wide geographical representation .  
In the composition of subsidiary organs , emphasis shall be placed on the need for members qualified and competent in relevant technical matters dealt with by those organs , provided that due account shall be taken of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and of special interests .  
In fact , the concept is embedded in the FAO Constitution , Article VII , paragraph 3 , which states : " In appointing the staff , the Director-General shall , subject to the paramount importance of securing the highest standards of efficiency and technical competence , pay due regard to the importance of selecting personnel recruitment on as wide a geographical basis as possible " .  NULLA member State 's representation is determined directly by its contribution to the regular budget .  
The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .

It was hard to reconcile calls made by delegations for equitable geographical distribution with a situation in which the vast majority of staff members , including many whose professional qualifications did not meet the high standards of the international civil service , enjoyed permanent status .  
This data will be utilized by OHRM 's human resources planning specialist to project external recruitment needs sufficiently in advance as to allow National Competitive Examinations to target occupational groupings of staff to meet the current and anticipated2 needs of the Organization , while addressing as well equitable geographical distribution concerns .  
This is intended to lead to more rational , transparent and effective recruitment , placement and promotion strategies that take into account existing staff profiles and potential , and target recruitment and staff development needs to take into account , in particular , equitable geographical distribution and gender balance requirements .

We make this statement for the sake of the record of this institution , which was established for the attainment of the goals and ideals reflected in its Charter , maintains its neutrality , supports peoples ' will and is based on the principles of sovereign equality of all States , irrespective of their size , geographical location and military or economic potentialities .  
While proximity to the countries is a definite advantage in developing geographical specialization - something difficult to achieve by entities outside the region - the marked heterogeneity among the countries of the ESCAP region calls for special skills , localized knowledge , and competence for adopting , whenever required , a case-by-case approach .  
The rich variety of geographical , ethnic , cultural and linguistic origins within the staff of the Commission has served , as I intended , to centre and balance the work of the secretariat to meet the required high standards of independence , effectiveness and impartiality , which are expected from a United Nations operation .  
These tasks are also dictated by the increase in the membership of the Organization , by the full application of the principles of sovereign equality and equitable geographical representation based on the Organization 's universal nature , and by the recognition that the United Nations remains a viable alternative for Member States .
