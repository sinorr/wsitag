The director of the East China Sea Section of the State Oceanic Administration , Zhang Youfen , said red tide is a common incident in the international marine environment .  Its impacts can be confined to the smallest scope if strict monitoring , warning and precautionary measures are taken .  Any panic is unnecessary .  
Wen Jiabao noted : The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have attached great importance to the management of national land and resources ; have set up a number of systems for the unified control of natural resources , including land , mineral , and marine resources ; and have made it clear that same as family planning and environmental protection , the protection and a rational use of natural resources is also considered a basic national policy of our country .  
The publication and implementation of " the Provisions " indicate that China has advanced a big step in developing legal system governing public security and border patrol .  They have very important significance in demonstrating China 's efforts to strengthen the administration over vessels along the coasts , to prevent and crack down on marine crimes , and to safeguard social order along coastal regions and at sea .  
During the continuous cooperation of an electronic warfare exercise , the naval , air , and marine troops staged coordinated exercises and training on dozens of scenarios , including such naval training scenarios as firing at surface targets , launching anti-submarine rockets , launching air defense missiles , and launching an underwater anti-submarine operation , a surface interception operation , a surface search operation , a surface rescue operation , or a surface fire support operation , and so on ; 
During the combined " circum-Pacific " military exercises staged in June and July , the United States took the lead in conducting a one-week humanitarian rescue operation code-named " Strong Angel " .  Their idea is : If two neighboring nations resort to arms , a third nation ( and its allies ) will send naval forces and marine corps to prevent the war from escalating and thus ensure regional " stability " .  They will also send food , tents , and other necessities of life to the invaded nation .  
In the twilight of the 20th century , the Chinese Navy sounded its siren as it sails into the ocean of the new century : Two naval formations charted new routes of crossing both the east and west hemispheres and the north and south hemispheres on the marine chart of the world this year , with one formation crossing the Pacific and reaching the North American continent and the other formation crossing the Indian Ocean , rounding the Cape of Good Hope and sailing into the Atlantic Ocean for the first time .  
This marine brigade , which is dubbed " China 's no . 1 army , " has been set up with great care to fight and win in a future partial hi-tech war ; every one of its members has to undergo training from hell , be familiar with all kinds of weapons , be skilled in close combat , and have the ability to live off the land .  
Fishing folks along the southern Fujian coast are devout believers in the goddess Matsu and look upon her as a " strait goddess " who " makes her power felt on the sacred sea " and protects fishing folks against marine perils .  Hence , fishing folks have built by the seaside one temple after another for worshipping the goddess Matsu . On Dongshan Island you can also see such southern Fujian buildings with carved beams and walls and colorfully painted , upward tilted eaves that have been built for generations .  
A rapid response unit will join in the military exercise for the first time .  The special armed unit whose members were transferred from the Beijing Theater 's certain group army , has accomplished various assault training missions in northern China over the last two years .  The unit has been airlifted to the Fuzhou Theater by Russia-made IL-76 transport planes to join in live-fire training .  In addition , the airborne force is now in a predetermined area awaiting orders .  The marine corps has also sent a task force to take part in the war drill .  
Second stage .  The three forces will cooperate in see crossing and landing operations , including simulated missile attacks , air assaults , night airborne raids , naval and ground forces occupying islands and launching sudden attacks , the special armed unit 's sudden attacks on ports or airports , and house-to-house fighting .  This reveals that the PLA 's island-attacking pattern has begun to change from " marine landings " into " airborne assaults . "  Under the new pattern , cracks troops rather than large numbers of troops will be sent to occupy important strategic points .  
Afterwards , Su-27 fighters , " Flying Leopard " fighters , and Qiang-5 attack aircraft began their air raids .  Then , special armed units parachuted in for sudden attacks .  Shielded by destroyers , landing-craft vessels , submarines , and armored helicopters , tens of thousands of field army troops , the naval marine brigade , called as the world army No . 1 , and amphibious tanks fiercely attacked the offshore islands off Dongshan Island and Zhaoan Bays and attacked Penghu Island and Taiwan Island in a simulated manner .  
Second , we should actively promote the research of high technologies of strategic significance , and launch major and important engineering projects using new and high technologies .  To bring about a leap forward in the development of productive forces in our country , we should keep abreast of the new development trend of the world 's high technologies and related industries ; intensify our strategic studies of high technologies in such key fields as information technology , biological technology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing and automation technology , and marine technology ;  
With high functional density , short lead time , low costs , and other special features , small satellites are extensively applied to mobile communications , resources exploration , forest conflagrations , flooding , and marine monitoring , and yield social and economic benefits , becoming an important industry for countries with advanced aerospace technology .  
With its great efforts over the past 50 years , the Chinese Navy has initially built a modern marine operational force composed of the crack troops of five branches - - surface warships , submarines , naval air force , coastal guard , and the marines .  The Chinese Navy is capable of carrying out various kinds of operational tasks on coastal waters .  
The Chinese military expert held that the 21st century would be a " marine century . "  He said : It is necessary to make conscientious efforts to build a powerful and large navy and turn it into one of the major forces that protect the motherland and safeguard world peace and regional security .  
Now , it is basically provided with the capacities of conducting sea-air maneuver and conducting operations in coordination with all other armed forces .  It has played a positive role in resisting the invasion of foreign enemies , defending the security of the sea and the air , safeguarding China 's marine rights and interests , and supporting the economic construction of the state .

Rapid response units , amphibious armored units , digital artillery units , special combat units , marine corps of the navy , airborne units , and airmen of the ground force , the navy and the air force , which had gathered here , were marshaled in rank for battle .  
Tens of thousands of troops from around the country took part in the exercises , encompassing all the military regions nationwide .  Branches of the military taking part in the exercises included rapid response units , amphibious armored units , digital artillery units , special operations units , marine corps units , airborne units , Army , Navy , and Air Force aviation units , and reservist units .  
Yet , while we benefit from a rich material life and the sophisticated infrastructures we have developed , we shall never overlook the problems that come with our development .  Some of the major concerns of people at large are the air quality , marine and river pollution , and some indiscernible ecological problems .  
( d ) In general , for reclamation works where the marine mud is not dredged away , a suitable geotextile fabric is placed on top of the marine mud to contain it in position while allowing water dissipation .  It is then covered with a layer of sand to help control lateral displacement of the mud and to drain away the water dissipated from the marine mud .  Fill material is then placed on the sand in layers of uniform thickness until the reclamation is complete .  
Holders of valid Dumping Licences for public filling areas may be permitted to dump materials such as earth , building debris , broken rock and concrete at the barging point provided that the materials are free from marine mud , household refuse , plastic , metal , industrial and chemical waste , animal and vegetable matter and other materials considered unsuitable . 
She was pleased to know that later this year , after a new radar station in Mirs Bay became operative , traffic surveillance in that area would be further enhanced and that a complete upgrading of the existing VTS system had been planned for early 2000 ' s to cope with anticipated growth in marine traffic into the next century . 
For examples , he said , nowadays sea lanes were no longer dominated by traditional maritime powers , seafarers were more likely to come from Asia than Europe , trading patterns had changed , tankers and bulk carriers had grown to sizes that were unimaginable before , cargoes were moved by containers instead of carried in sacks and on pallets , the realisation of the need to tackle marine pollution and the drastic improvements in communications at sea .  
The Government 's policy objective on the environmental well-being of the community is to improve our urban , rural and marine surroundings , conserve our natural heritage , and optimise the use of resources and goods so as to reduce pollution and waste and promote health and the enjoyment of our living environment .  
The Government has also conducted a more focused site search along the entire north shore of the Hong Kong Island and having taken into account all the relevant considerations ( e.g . land availability , land-use , marine impact , etc . ) concluded that the site in North Point proposed by the private developer is the most suitable site . 
The planned GIC uses include a swimming pool complex , a sports stadium , a training school and other facilities of the Immigration Department , water-related recreational facilities / holiday camps , social welfare uses , a wholesale marine fish market , indoor recreational centres , and primary and secondary schools .  
A vessel sank between Tap Mun Chau and Chek Chau on January 1 , last year , but to date a container on the sunken vessel is still left in the sea and has not been salvaged .  Recently , the plastic waste inside that container has been flowing out from the container and drifting about in the nearby waters , resulting in the death of a substantial amount of marine fish in the fish culture zones in these waters , and causing serious damage to marine ecology .  
All modular display units are specially designed to represent the natural marine environment , depicting sandy beach , rocky shore , coral reefs and even the deep sea .  
Speaking on the project , Marine Parks Officer , Dr Cheng Wo-wing said : " The exhibition introduces to the public the beautiful seascape , the majestic coast , the tranquil marine environment and the rich and diverse marine habitat found in Hong Kong . " It serves to enhance public understanding of our marine environment and to promote the importance of its conservation . "

The audience will experience what Darwin did not - - descending to a depth of 1,000 m , exploring the deep sea that still remains veiled in mystery today .  The 40-minute long film will offer the audience the opportunity to encounter some unique creatures of the Galapagos Islands and their surrounding waters ranging from giant land tortoises , red and blue-footed boobies and other unusual birds to hammerhead and whale sharks , marine iguanas and a diversity of intriguing sea life .  
Another key success that we have had in applying EIA was the abandonment of a project which proposed the excavation of 400 million cubic metres of fill material from Mirs Bay to the east of Hong Kong : one of the most pristine , valuable marine ecosystems left in Hong Kong . EIA has saved it from destruction and preserved it for present and future generations to enjoy . 
" Entries to the photographic competition give beautiful depiction to the majestic coast , the tranquil marine environment and the rich and diverse marine habitat found in Hong Kong . " More than 70 outstanding pieces will be shown at the exhibition for the public to see , through the participants ' perception , the beauty and functions of marine parks .  " Visitors can also get a glimpse of our beautiful seascape and the mysterious underwater world , " he added .  
" Cargo material contained in the cargo hold bilge water is not treated as cargo residues provided that the cargo material is not classified as a marine pollutant in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code and the bilge water is discharged from a loaded hold through the vessel 's fixed piping bilge drainage system . "

During this marine phase , apart from intensifying its scheduled daily scavenging and refuse collection work , the MD has been carrying out special operations like collecting floating refuse at identified major marine refuse black spots including typhoon shelters and waters off gazetted and ungazetted beaches .  
The funded projects cover a wide spectrum including research into real-time bilateral teleoperation of internet based robotic systems , economic reforms and labour market transitions in urban China , studies on dendritic cell functions in chronic Chinese Hepatitis B patients , high performance non-lead piezoelectric single crystal materials , interactions of trace metals and macronutrients in marine plankton , etc .  
Mr Tupper is an expert in the maritime field .  In his current post as Assistant Director / Planning and Services , Mr Tupper is responsible for future port planning and development , cross boundary ferry terminals , harbour moorings and navigational aids , public cargo working areas , control of marine pollution , and the Hydrographic Office .  
To wild dolphins , human is the biggest threat to them apart from shark , its main predator .  Thousands of dolphins die everyday in fishing nets around the world .  What 's more , the seriously polluted environment makes dolphins increasingly vulnerable .  In view of that , many scientists , naturalists and marine biologists devote their lifetime to study dolphins , their mode of communication , foraging and social behaviors so as to preserve these graceful and extraordinary creatures .  
An environmentalist is reported to have stated that the underground drainage system in the area around Dundas Street in Mongkok has been misconnected , causing the inflow of sewage from commercial and domestic buildings into the stormwater drainage system and threatening the health of the residents in the vicinity .  As such sewage may not have undergone any treatment before it is directly discharged into the Victoria Harbour , the marine environment may be polluted .  
Milkfish Culture in Taiwan A succession of milkfish ponds can be found dotted on tidal lands in Yunlin , Chiayi , Tainan and Pingtung counties along the southwest coast of Taiwan . Milkfish , also called Bandeng or Bangos , is a silvery marine food fish collected when young and raised for food in brackish or freshwater tropical ponds .  
From the green-house effect , global climatic change , acid rain , the hole in the ozone layer , destruction of the rain forests , conservation of animal and plant species in the wild , to desertification and the shrinkage of marine mammals , all of this was very little discussed and paid scant attention .  
What Lin calls " knowing the earth " involves becoming familiar with different geographical environments . High mountains , rivers and marine islands all have their different appearances and their own special types of plants and animals ; tropical , temperate and frigid zones have their own natural conditions that can not be confused .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
Teach fishermen restraintAlthough Taiwan 's tiny community of marine scholars has already been worn thin studying ocean-dwelling mammals , NTOU , the only institution engaged in shark research , put forth a five-year plan for basic research in this area . Their goal is to understand the local shark catch situation and provide data for reference if controls are imposed in the future .  
In August this year , satellite transmitters were attached to marine turtles on Penghu ; three years ago , a Formosan black bear was released into Yushan National Park wearing a radio collar ; and the squirrels scampering through the grass and up and down the tall tropical trees of Taipei Botanical Garden have been kitted out with modern high-tech products for several years now .  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased . In addition to growing grain and vegetables , the scope of the missions has also come to include animal husbandry work-raising pigs and chickens ; marine technology-fishing techniques and the breeding and raising of marine animals ; handicraft work-bamboo weaving , wood carving ; and such areas of work as flood prevention and water conservation projects among others .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
Except for a small number of sea creatures which are attracting international attention because their numbers are dropping sharply-such as the shark , whale , and sea turtle-few marine animals are protected by law , and it is not difficult for aquariums to collect specimens . Since these then become the main selling points to attract visitors , particular attention is therefore devoted to how these precious creatures respond to their new environment .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
After work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation . But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three-kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like . Environmental protection agencies are weak , and research funding is limited . Thus there is little concrete knowledge about the numbers of various species and whether these numbers are rising or falling , not to mention any understanding of what concrete steps can be taken to solve specific problems .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
According to surveys , there are currently in excess of 100,000 belugas in the ocean . Although they are not among the most endangered animals , CITES has included them on Appendix II ( which includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction , but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival ) , both because of their numbers and because of the growing problem of marine pollution .  
" Back in the 1960s and 1970s , increasing food production was an important target of economic planning , " says former Council of Agriculture chairman Peng Tso-kwei . Developing mountain and marine food sources and developing marginal land were central to achieving this objective . The government even established a special Bureau of Mountain Agriculture and Animal Husbandry , as well as another agency to develop land reclaimed from the sea .  
An approach to marine pollution prevention " , GESAMP Report and Studies , No . 30 , 1986 .  Heavy trawls may be considered " green " on deep muddy grounds but " red " in shallow estuaries and coastal zones or coral reefs .  
As part of the effort to expand the production base for trade , island developing countries need to strengthen regional capabilities for the effective surveillance and monitoring of marine and coastal resources and activities in the exclusive economic zones .  
Such cooperation was aimed at preserving the marine environment and living resources , disposing of toxic wastes , developing coastal infrastructure and taking joint action to promote sustainable development in border areas .  The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m .  
Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Furthermore , other recent endeavours , including the 1995 Agreement on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the work of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , reflect the determination of the international community to develop and strengthen the global legal order for the sustainable development of the living and non-living resources of marine and coastal waters .  
Owing to insufficient consultations and negotiations at the Conference , reasonable views and opinions of some States that have major interests in marine fisheries failed to be duly reflected in relevant provisions .  The actual implementation of these Articles may encounter many difficulties and may increase the differences and disputes between States with conflicting interests .  
At their meeting earlier this month , the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean Community again expressed grave concern at the recurring threat posed to the region through the marine transport of irradiated nuclear fuel , plutonium and high-level radioactive wastes .  
Many species , such as migratory species , species dependent on the timing of ice-melting , Arctic communities , marine , coastal and peripheral populations , genetically impoverished species , mountain and alpine communities , and species that inhabit dry lands , semi-arid and arid ecosystems , are all likely to be adversely affected by global warming ; the climatic changes predicted may bring about catastrophic losses in genetic resources and species and ecosystem diversity .  
ECA provides advisory services and support to its member States on agriculture and rural development policies , planning and programming , with a focus on measures for the conservation of natural forests and their biodiversity , desertification and the related conservation of biodiversity , the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and green belts in targeted countries , and the strengthening of regional cooperation programmes for the optimum and sustainable use of inland and marine fisheries .  
Programmes dealing with biosafety have expanded beyond the scientific sector to include the concerns of workers exposed to biological agents in the workplace ( ILO ) , farmers ( FAO ) and the general public , while programmes on marine agricultural and industrial biotechnology call for closer cooperation among FAO , ILO , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , UNEP , UNIDO , WHO and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .  
Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , are a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Activities planned for 1996-1997 are expected to result in ( a ) a knowledge base upon which management strategies and plans can be formulated and implementation initiated to ensure the protection and sustainable development of marine and coastal areas ; and ( b ) establishment of mechanisms and policy options for the development of environmental protection and sustainable management and plans .  
Field projects . ( i ) Establishment of four port reception facilities in the Mediterranean ; ( ii ) two field projects on the assessment of threats to marine mammals ; ( iii ) one marine biodiversity assessment ; ( iv ) strengthening of four institutional arrangements for integrated coastal zone planning and management ; and ( v ) 10 projects to assist Mediterranean countries to set up their legislation concerning specially protected areas .  
Within the project on " Coastal Marine Pollution Monitoring and Training : Asia Pacific Mussel Watch " , UNU is seeking to analyse and monitor key hazardous chemicals and substances in the coastal marine areas of the Asia-Pacific region , including relative levels of important agricultural and industrial halogenated hydrocarbons in the eastern Pacific .  
" ' Damage to the Antarctic environment or dependent or associated ecosystems ' means any impact on the living or non-living components of that environment or those ecosystems , including harm to atmospheric , marine or terrestrial life , beyond that which is negligible or which has been assessed and judged to be acceptable pursuant to this Convention . "  
The Office provides legal advice and services in operational matters to United Nations organs , bodies and Secretariat units and is responsible for meeting the needs of Member States in dealing with legal , political , economic , scientific , technical and environmental aspects of the law of the sea and marine affairs .  
Their needs for coordinated information and advice will be addressed through the development and operation of a centralized system of integrated databases , inter alia , on marine legislation and marine policy , as well as by intensifying general legal advice and other advisory services and by focusing dissemination of information on national , regional and international developments in the law of the sea and ocean affairs .  
For the sustainable development of ocean resources in the context of the international ocean regime , priority will be given to the needs of States for specialized data and information for developing integrated national , subregional or regional information systems on marine areas within national jurisdiction and for putting in place appropriate legislative frameworks .  
Particular areas in which regional cooperation requires strengthening by both the Territories concerned and international agencies : preservation and protection of marine and other natural resources from over-exploitation ; transport and communications ; higher education ; research and development ; regional pooling arrangements for sharing special skills and expertise ; and assistance in the public health area ;  
Regarding protection of the marine environment , the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities , expected to be adopted at an intergovernmental conference on the subject to be held in Washington , D.C . , from 23 October to 3 November 1995 , would contribute to the effective implementation of relevant provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and various regional maritime conventions and protocols .  
To identify the crucial international conventions relating to ships and shipping operations and to implement those conventions as early as possible within an agreed harmonized framework , and take all other appropriate steps , in conjunction with established regional and international programmes , to promote maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment of ACS States , countries and territories from vessel-caused pollution ;  
Building upon earlier activities and based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the coastal and marine pollution loads from land-based sources in the eastern African subregion , including the Comoros and Seychelles , the planned development of a regional overview and strategy will lead to the implementation of various additional activities , such as monitoring programmes .

The General Assembly has proclaimed 1998 to be the International Year of the Ocean . 158 / This initiative is expected to generate important cooperative efforts in the United Nations system 159 / and stimulate greater global awareness of the oceans and greater cooperation for the effective protection and management of marine and coastal areas and resources . 
While the term " living resources " in the Convention might be broad enough to include free living and symbiotic micro-organisms , the collection and subsequent use of microbial genetic resources is not necessarily analogous to traditional methods of harvesting marine living resources .  
On the contrary , at that meeting the participants had unanimously adopted the Brisbane Declaration , which called upon France , amongst other things , to conduct a prior assessment of any major project such as nuclear testing on the marine environment , and to make its data and studies available to the international community for independent and comprehensive assessment .  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;

In many cases , the unrestricted use of technology , the growing demand for goods and services from the ocean , uncontrolled population growth and continuous migration to coastal areas have led to the depletion of living resources and the degradation of the coastal and marine environment as well as of the economic conditions of some of the major sectors exploiting the ocean .  
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 called for governmental action , with the assistance of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system when required and with the active participation of the people and sectors involved and that of the non-governmental organizations , in order to : ( a ) improve the use and conservation of coastal resources through integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) ; ( b ) increase marine environmental protection from land-based and sea-based sources of pollution  
Protection of the atmosphere , in regard to : ( i ) absorption of greenhouse gases ; ( ii ) climate change and its potentially drastic effects on marine living resources ; ( iii ) energy optimization programmes and reduction of dangerous substances in exhaust gas emissions ; and ( iv ) reduction in the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) in at-sea and coastal ocean industries ; ( g ) Chapter 10 .  
Recognizing further the progress made during the post-UNCED process in developing international and regional standards and action plans relevant to the protection and management of coastal and marine environments and to the sustainable use and conservation of its resources , recommend that Governments : ( i ) continue to use existing mechanisms and forums to foster further progress ; ( ii ) actively participate in regional action plans , programmes and other cooperative arrangements ; and ( iii ) take advantage of international collaboration , particularly in the area of financing ;  
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
Other specific areas that have been mentioned as deserving future attention include , inter alia , persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals ( preparatory work initiated for developing protocols to the 1979 ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution ) ; joint implementation and tradable permits ; protection of marine biodiversity ; protection of inland waters ; protection of the soils ; mountain ecosystems ; introduction of genetically modified and alien organisms ; child labour ; and environmental impact assessment .  
The aforementioned 1972 London Dumping Convention for the prevention of marine pollution by waste dumping has been significantly strengthened by amendments in 1993 banning the dumping of radioactive , industrial and incineration wastes ; a new protocol under discussion would ban all marine disposal except in specific cases that could be shown to have no adverse environmental impacts .  
Decisions on questions affecting the marine environment must be the result of an integrated approach , taking into account all relevant environmental , social and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing countries , as well as the best available scientific evidence .  
The Working Group also stressed the need for increased support for training and capacity-building in the field of integrated management of coastal areas , and stressed the need for taking action to protect all critical habitats of marine living resources in the coastal zone , including coral reefs , mangroves , mudflats and estuaries .  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
As regards the subprogramme on environmental law , institutions and policies , over 10 additional intergovernmental meetings were convened on issues relating to the protection of marine environment from land-based sources of pollution ; the Lusaka Agreement on cooperative enforcement operations directed at illegal trade in wild fauna and flora ; military activities and the environment ; and African Ministerial Conference on the Environment .  
As stated in the aide-m \ x { 5e66 } oire transmitted to the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Buenos Aires on 27 February 1996 , the Argentine Republic reiterates that the only rules applicable to the utilization of Antarctic marine living resources in the area adjacent to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are those laid down in the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and such rules adopted by the Commission established under the Convention as are currently in force .  
Establish cooperative mechanisms with global , regional and national organizations involved in marine geological and geophysical data collection , in particular , data related to the bathymetry , macro - and microtopographical data of the Area ;  
Island developing countries should seek to exploit fully , within the limits of sustainability , their agricultural potential and marine resources in the exclusive economic zones by enhancing relevant skills and carrying out specialized studies on the conservation , management and surveillance of these resources .  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Furthermore , international law permits the coastal State to conduct only marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone , not " any kind of research " , as stated in article 14 , subparagraph ( b ) ( ii ) , of the aforementioned Iranian Act .  
They reaffirmed that the Convention and the agreements represented significant achievements of the international community through multilateral efforts in creating a legal order for the seas and the oceans that will , inter alia , facilitate international communications , promote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans , the equitable and efficient utilization of their resources , the conservation of their living resources and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
The fundamental importance of the law of the sea institutions for international peace and security , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the sustainable development of marine resources and the protection of the environment has allowed them to evolve successfully , despite the increasing financial difficulties for Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  
Being a comprehensive instrument also , the Convention holds considerable " strategic importance . . . as a framework for national , regional and global action in the marine sector " ( resolution 49 / 28 , preamble ) , with further implications , in turn , for the manner in which the system of ocean institutions will evolve , in particular the core institutions established by the Convention . 
The coastal State may , pursuant to article 211 ( 6 ) , under the conditions stipulated therein , adopt special mandatory laws and regulations for the prevention , reduction and control of marine pollution in a clearly defined area in its exclusive economic zone where such special laws and regulations are required for recognized technical reasons in relation to its oceanography , ecology , resource use and maritime traffic conditions .  
According to Indonesia , the proposed axis lines are the result of years of careful study of various factors , such as : the need of international transportation and aviation in transiting Indonesian waters ; the hydrographic and natural marine conditions in and near the relevant axis lines ; the intensity of coastal and inter-island navigation and overflight ; the intensity of fishing activities , particularly of local artisanal fishermen ; the existence of oil and gas exploration and exploitation ;  
It expressly recognizes , and indeed mandates , the need for further elaboration of international rules , standards and recommended practices and procedures for marine environmental protection at the global and regional levels , but at the same time ensures that these more specialized processes are guided by its basic structure .  
Among other actions , the Subcommittee agreed that the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities would be considered as the cooperative programme framework for programme areas A ( integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ) and B ( i ) ( marine environmental protection : land-based sources ) .  
While this new instrument has no binding character , it rests on a firm international legal basis , most particularly on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , 169 and also on the 1972 London Convention , particularly in the light of its forthcoming amendment , and on the numerous regional instruments for the protection of the marine environment against land-based activities , including most recently the revised Protocol on Protection of the Mediterranean Sea from Pollution by Land-based Sources and Activities ( March 1996 ) .  
The topic touches not only on the protection and preservation of the marine environment , including that of the international seabed area , but also on such other matters as the application of the consent regime for marine scientific research , the regime for protected areas in the exclusive economic zone , the duties of conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas , and the sustainable development of living marine resources generally .  
The group of experts on marine and coastal biodiversity , established pursuant to decision II / 10 of the Second Conference of Parties , has not been able to meet as planned ; however , the first step has been achieved in drawing up a roster of nominated experts from which the group will be composed .  
SBSTTA has recommended that this expert group should concentrate on determining the following areas where the Biodiversity Convention can have the greatest effect : integrated marine and coastal area management , marine and coastal protected areas , sustainable use of coastal and marine living resources , mariculture and alien species . 193 Other items of particular note discussed by SBSTTA included the economic valuation of biological diversity and its components , in particular in relation to access to genetic resources ( art . 15 of the Convention ) .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
Establish cooperative mechanisms with global , regional and national organizations involved in marine geological and geophysical data collection , in particular , data related to the bathymetry , macro - and micro-topographical data of the Area ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
While bilateral aid from donor countries , support from governmental agencies , assistance from international agencies , international development and aid institutions have an important role in supplementing national and regional endeavours in this regard , it is essential that due importance be given to development mechanisms that are better able to cope with the transboundary movement of marine resources and to address the transboundary nature of marine environmental problems .  
The draft resolution before us on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing , unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction and fisheries by-catch and discards draws attention to a number of damaging practices that continue to threaten a sustainable future for the world 's living marine resources .  
At the national level my country has pursued for some years a solid , viable , scientifically based programme to ensure the sustainability of tuna fishing and to guarantee the preservation of all living marine resources .  
This is a demonstration of our firm commitment to the principles contained in those instruments : multilateralism , the responsible utilization of renewable resources to ensure the continued availability of a valuable source of protein , employment for our people , the effective preservation of marine mammals and the use of science to protect a complex and delicate ecosystem .  
It proposes the establishment of a new oceanic order in the twenty-first century , as well as the joint management and scientific development of marine resources on an equitable and peaceful basis so as to maintain the ecological balance of oceans and achieve the sustainable development of marine resources .  It calls on States parties to the Convention to strengthen cooperation and establish joint management and development zones of marine resources .  
The 1982 Convention , although the most universal and extensive instrument on the law of the sea , nevertheless can not fully reflect the growing concern of coastal States at the state of living marine resources , which often fall victim to uncontrolled and scientifically unsound harvesting on the high seas .  
The Congress provided a superb and unique opportunity for representatives of the merchant marine industry and collateral fields to describe to future interested parties how the Panama Canal works and thus give them a complete understanding of what lies ahead for the Canal .  
The region \ x { e5b8 } constant focus on democracy , good governance , peace , security and nuclear disarmament ; its undertaking to take responsibility for the proper and responsible management of the environment ; the protection of fish and other marine resources ; cultural and technology exchanges ; and economic cooperation and respect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone is successfully dealing with a changing global environment .  
Future international action should address the oceans , particularly the sustainable use of marine resources through improved environmental approaches to marine ecology ; the protection and sustainable use of fresh water and wetland habitats , particularly in arid regions ; the protection and sustainable use of forests and woodlands ; and the problems of hazardous chemicals .  
Furthermore , they have established programmes to develop the principles of the CBD and facilitate their implementation : on coastal and marine biodiversity ; forest biodiversity ; agricultural biodiversity ; the biodiversity of inland waters ; the rights of indigenous and local communities under the CBD ; and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity .  
In particular , Parties have through the CBD been actively pursuing a strategy of establishing the legal basis to ensure the integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources under national jurisdiction ( programme area D ) .  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level and low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people and the marine environment or does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
Urge all SAARC countries to preserve rare , fragile , ecologically sensitive coastal and marine ecosystems , such as mangroves , coral reefs , sea-grass beds , etc . , for conservation and sustainable use of the resources under national jurisdiction .  
Continuing the international dialogue on the issues of conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity and agricultural biological diversity was also very important , since both issues were essential to food security , which was the focus of the forthcoming World Food Summit ; the work being undertaken by the Intergovernmental Panel on forests was likewise crucial to that discussion .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Many countries , including Peru , are currently facing a cyclical , worldwide natural phenomenon known as El Ni �� , whose severe economic , environmental and social consequences are drastically changing the marine environment , which is a source of food and employment for broad sectors of humankind .  
In this regard , it should be emphasized that the Jakarta Mandate covering the following areas : integrated marine and coastal area management ; marine and coastal protected areas ; sustainable use of marine and coastal living resources ; and mariculture and alien species called , inter alia , for the effective implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity concerning marine and coastal biodiversity questions .  
Another significant event in the international community 's quest to apply the rule of law in relations between States in marine affairs was the successful completion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea of its judicial organizational phase , despite operating with a modest budget and a tiny staff under its President , Thomas Mensah .  
These documents have established a legal order governing the ocean space which will contribute to the exploration of the sea for peaceful purposes and the equitable and efficient utilization of marine resources and facilitate the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order .  
It is obvious that without a comprehensive sustainable energy strategy , global warming will continue unabated , urban air with continue to deteriorate and marine pollution will not be halted .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
The main issues that have emerged during SBSTTA sessions have been detailed technical issues , such as how to promote access to and transfer of technology , the development of monitoring systems and assessments , and issues dealing with agricultural , terrestrial , marine and coastal biodiversity and traditional knowledge .  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
The Penal Code lays down offences of an ecological nature , dealing , for example , with the unlawful destruction of raw materials , trees , agricultural or industrial products or means of production , such destruction being detrimental to national wealth or consumption , as well as with the protection of mammals or marine vertebrates and aquatic species .  
Spain reported on initiatives to combat marine pollution , including the control and monitoring of maritime transport of pollutant products that may have an impact on the environment ; the prevention of pollution from ships ; the monitoring and control of industrial waste or waste from ships ; and active participation in the implementation of specific maritime safety plans in each port , taking into account current provisions including those of the National Regulation for the Admission , Handling and Storage of Hazardous Goods in Ports .  
IMO forwarded a document entitled " Status of international conventions relating to marine pollution of which IMO is depositary or responsible for secretariat duties " , which provided information of relevance to the issues of concluded bilateral and multilateral treaties , including legislation to ensure their implementation , and information on the status of implementation of international conventions at the national level .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
We also recognized that the problems of the environment , such as global warming , the destruction of coastal and marine ecosystems , the degradation of forests , desertification and the overuse of mineral resources are concerns not of any one nation or continent , but of the entire international community .  
We are deeply convinced that such an approach will increase the responsibility of each littoral State for the consequences of activities in its own sector ; make possible the effective legal regulation of the use of marine resources on the basis of national legislation ; make it easier to attract foreign investment to the region , which in turn will contribute to the region 's economic growth ; and minimize the likelihood of disputes among States concerning specific deposits in the Caspian Sea .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the sustainable management , conservation and enhancement , as appropriate , of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , including biomass , forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial , coastal and marine ecosystems .  
We have to address as a matter of priority the three most immediate dangers identified by the Commission : the overexploitation of marine biological resources , the dumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global warming .  
We continue to be concerned at the threat to the fragile marine environment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear and other hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
In order to curb rapid loss of biodiversity , the deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled so as to reverse the serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
To curb rapid loss of biodiversity , deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled to reverse the continuing serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
These were responsible for the greater part of the landed catch of the worlds marine fisheries and were the main contributors to the global annual average of 28-million tons of discarded by-catch .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
In the Caribbean , in collaboration with selected regional institutions , OAS is currently providing technical assistance for the execution of three major projects : assessment of coastal and marine problems ; assessment of the current state of effluent disposal in the region ; and comprehensive review of integrated coastal zone management legislative systems .  
The Coastal Module Panel of GOOS has begun the design of optimal monitoring and forecasting systems for coastal seas , focusing on preserving healthy coastal environments , promoting sustainable use of resources , mitigating coastal hazards , and enabling safe and efficient marine operations .  
The Global Programme of Action states at the outset that its implementation will require new approaches by and new forms of collaboration among Governments , organizations and institutions with responsibilities and expertise relevant to marine and coastal areas , at all levels national , regional and global including the promotion of innovative financial mechanisms to generate needed resources .  
The disposal of untreated effluents into surrounding areas of land and sea often leads to the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , loss of valuable marine life , destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
Stress the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
Contributing factors to the marine environmental deterioration include oil exploration and exploitation , rapid economic growth , overfishing , physical alteration of the coastlines by dredging and filling , discharge of raw sewage , disposal of untreated industrial effluents , and dumping wasted oil and debris .  
Enhanced national capacity for integrating environmental considerations into economic and social policies ; improvement of energy efficiency and conservation potentials ; wider application of renewable energy technologies ; formulation and implementation of integrated development and management policies in the water , mineral and marine resources sectors ; natural disaster preparedness and mitigation ; and application of space technology through human resources development activities ;  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
Invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities ;  
One of the most important challenges being tackled by Ukrainian specialists is to study the seas surface , atmospheric and oceanic dynamics , and marine temperatures and colours by means of satellite data , such research constituting a basic component of environmental monitoring and surveillance of navigational hazards .  
The Commission invited all organizations concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider whether their programmes of work provided sufficient consideration of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review what needed to be done to ensure adequate prediction and understanding of the impacts on coastal and marine areas of phenomena such as El Nio .  
It is also keeping the U . S . marine units based in Okinawa , Japan , and the aircraft carrier Constellation , F-15 tactical fighters , B-52 strategic bombers and EA-6B electronic warfare aircraft based in its mainland on standby for rapid deployment in south Korea .  
Promoting the formulation , adoption and implementation of appropriate technical , institutional , administrative and legal measures contributing to improved protection of marine and coastal environment , including the rational use and conservation of their resources .  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
In the area of geological map configuration , the combined working methods of remote sensing technology and large-scale multi-picture surveys have reduced the actual costs by one third and the length of field survey routes by about one half compared with conventional methods .  Remote sensing technology has also been applied in archaeology , prospecting , railway and highway construction and marine information services .  
The main applications of this technology are to be found in the following fields : air and marine navigation , telecommunications , economic and social development , national capacity-building in formulating strategies geared to sustainable development and in solving problems in the fields of health and education , in the environmental sphere and in the areas of prevention and disaster relief .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Formulation of policies , strategies and measures to address fisheries needs , including the urgent need to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , to ensure essential sources of food supplies for island populations , and economic development ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
Given IMOs global regulatory mandate , which encompasses the development of international rules and standards designed to enhance the safety of life at sea and protect the marine environment from pollution caused by ships , the twin fundamentals of sustainable development and poverty alleviation have evolved in recent years as parallel concerns to the Organization .  
GOOS aims to meet the need for : ( a ) forecasting climate variability and change ; ( b ) assessing the state of health of the marine environment and its resources ( including the coastal zone ) ; and ( c ) supporting an improved decision-making and management process which takes into account potential natural and man-made changes in the environment and their effects on human health and resources .  
Our rich flora and fauna , marine life , mineral wealth and human potential is unparalleled , and this God-given untapped wealth can best be developed not by a single country but by our Mano River Union .  
e .  Marine environment assessments : global and regional assessments of the state of the marine environment ; global and regional assessments of marine mammals , including identification of endangered and threatened marine mammal species ; and rapid assessment methodology for coral reefs ( international coral reef initiative ) ;  
The Caribbean region and sea possessed a number of unique features which justified according them priority attention : exceptional biological diversity , highly fragile ecosystems and heavy reliance by most of the countries of the region on the coastal land and marine environment in order to achieve sustainable development .  
In my delegation ' s view , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a fundamental means of ensuring the peaceful and sustainable use and development of the oceans and their resources , through , in particular , the promotion of international cooperation , the equitable and efficient utilization and preservation of living marine resources , and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Formulation of policies , strategies and measures to address fisheries needs , including the urgent need to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , to ensure essential sources of food supplies for island populations , and economic development ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
These States are confronted with major challenges , such as protecting the marine environment against various forms of pollution , the increasing scarcity of fresh water , ever more frequent and devastating natural disasters , adapting to climate change and to the rising sea level , integrating into the global economy , and the diversification of their exports .  
The need for universal commitment to such preventive measures has become more pressing due to the isolation and oceanic location of some small island developing States and their total dependence on a marine and limited terrestrial base , which render them highly vulnerable to contamination from such waste .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
The Commission emphasizes the fundamental fact that oceans and seas constitute the major part of the planet that supports life , drive the climate and hydrological cycle , and provide the vital resources to be used to ensure well-being for present and future generations and economic prosperity , to eradicate poverty , to ensure food security and to conserve marine biological diversity and its intrinsic value for maintaining the conditions that support life on earth . 
The Commission urges support , upon the request of the State concerned , for national efforts to gain greater access to resource information and to develop appropriate policies to facilitate the exploration and exploitation , with the States consent and in a manner consistent with the sustainability of marine living resources , of non-living marine resources within its exclusive economic zones , or to the outer limits of the continental shelf , wherever applicable .  
Stresses the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , including the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
Invites all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction and coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as the El Nio phenomenon .  
The Commission invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities .  
The disposal of untreated effluents into surrounding areas of land and sea often leads to the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , loss of valuable marine life , destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
In terms of programme areas covered by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received larger shares were human resource development , transport and communication , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources , and energy resources .  
In short , the draft convention merely serves to protect the interests of developed countries , such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America , which have long _ standing international maritime traditions or a large merchant marine fleet and , consequently , wish to protect their ships from the calamity of arrest , which would prevent them from operating .  
Where untreated effluents are disposed into surrounding areas of land and sea , the result often is the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , the loss of valuable marine life , the destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
A number of initiatives have been taken by Governments , in all parts of the world to : ( a ) develop national strategies or master plans for sustainable development of tourism ; ( b ) develop appropriate regulatory mechanisms and tools , such as environmental assessment and the development of building regulations and environmental standards for tourism ; ( c ) create terrestrial and marine protected areas ; and ( d ) support voluntary initiatives by the tourism industry .  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
At the regional level , ongoing activities conducive to the sustainable management of coastal and marine resources include training of personnel , acquisition of equipment and facilities , production of stock assessment data and other resource inventories , upgrading of skills for management of marine parks , studies on pollution , information exchange and sharing of experience from within and outside the regions , and production of ICAM plans using regional guidelines .  
Small island developing States also have been the recipients of formal and informal training efforts to improve their capacity to implement sustainable coastal and marine resource management from regional and international institutions .  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
The present section summarizes , by region and by sea , the main priorities and challenges , developments in decision-making , and activities at the national level to promote integrated coastal zone management , marine environment protection , and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources .  
Parts of the region are also concerned about increased mineral loading in marine estuaries from upstream , intensive paddy cultivation and the conversion of intertidal zones ( i.e . , salt marsh and mangrove ) to rice paddy .  
New Zealand provided a variety of examples on technology innovations , including the use of wool booms in residual oil spill clean-ups , oil-eating microbes , development of captive breeding programmes for shellfish , experimental wave and tidal energy generation , and development of pharmaceutical and natural health products from marine sources , such as sponges .  
The major concerns of the Russian Federation ( 97 , 99 ) are the recently established state marine boundaries ( changing geopolitical situation ) , a worsening economic situation , increasing international competition for property rights on ocean zones and resources , and absence of a mechanism for interregional and intersectoral coordination in oceanic projects .  
The major interests at the international level are the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources and pollution by dumping of waste , protection of the sensitive environment of the Arctic Ocean , and exchange of scientific information on the oceans and its living resources .  
In terms of coverage of programme areas at the global level by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received large shares were human resources development , transport and communications , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources and energy resources .  
We are of the view that illegal , unregulated , unreported fishing activities have a severe adverse impact on the effectiveness of measures for the sustainable management and exploitation of marine living resources .  
CARICOM member States have for many years expressed growing concern at the increasing threat to our marine environment posed by pollution and by the transportation of hazardous and nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines , international aviation and marine bunker fuel emissions , based upon fuel sold to ships or aircraft engaged in international transport , should not be included in national totals , but reported separately .  
By the same token , the rest of the world can not ignore the unique contribution of small island developing States to global sustainability , through their rich biodiversity , their vast areas of marine resources and their coral reef systems .  
Those delegations expressed the view that such re-entry constituted a serious threat to human security and the economic activities of coastal States and threatened the marine environment and its natural resources .  
Noting the importance that the global meetings of regional seas conventions and action plans have taken as a consultative mechanism for the revitalization of Regional Seas Programme , including the strengthening of partnerships with international organizations dedicated to marine and coastal issues and the establishment of programmatic linkages with global environmental conventions and related agreements ,  
The States members of MERCOSUR and the associated countries considered that the strictest safety requirements should be observed in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , which posed great danger to the marine environment and the health of populations in affected areas .  
The basic consent provision is contained in article 246 , paragraphs 1 and 2 , whereby the coastal State in the exercise of its jurisdiction has the right to regulate , authorize and conduct marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone and on its continental shelf in accordance with relevant provisions of the Convention .  
Under article 272 , there is a particular duty to coordinate activities of international programmes : States are to endeavour to ensure that international organizations competent in the field of transfer of marine technology coordinate their activities , including any regional or global programmes , taking into account the interests and needs of developing States , particularly landlocked and geographically disadvantaged States .  
The aim of the Recommendations for Guidance is to define the biological , chemical , geological and physical components to be measured and the procedures to be followed by the Contractor to ensure the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects which may arise from its activities in the Area , and to provide guidance to prospective contractors in preparing plans of work for exploration for polymetallic nodules .  
In the context of establishing the limits of an extended continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles , the vast non-living marine resources that are known to occur on and beneath the deep seabed of the Pacific Ocean provide further opportunities that could provide the Pacific Island Forum States with an additional measure of economic independence .  
Recognize also the special needs of regional and subregional ecosystems , including arid and semi-arid , mountain , forest , marine , aquatic and island ecosystems , which are rich and diverse but generally fragile as well , together with the importance of ensuring their conservation , protection and sustainable use .  
Data received from the SAC-C satellite are used to study the terrestrial and marine environment , assess desertification , monitor flooding , forecast agricultural production , monitor the atmospheric temperature and vapour content of water with a view to determining the variability of the atmospheric structure , perform measurements of the geomagnetic field with the same level of accuracy attained by observatories , measure atmospheric space radiation and its effects on advanced electronic components , determine the migratory route of the southern right whale and verify methods used in determining satellite attitude and velocity .  
Climate change had , among other things , increased the scarcity and diminished the quality of fresh water and had contributed to the degradation of coastal zones and marine ecosystems in all CARICOM member countries , which therefore continued to seek the support of the United Nations for a special regime for the Caribbean Sea .  
The director of the East China Sea Section of the State Oceanic Administration , Zhang Youfen , said red tide is a common incident in the international marine environment .  Its impacts can be confined to the smallest scope if strict monitoring , warning and precautionary measures are taken .  Any panic is unnecessary .  
Wen Jiabao noted : The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have attached great importance to the management of national land and resources ; have set up a number of systems for the unified control of natural resources , including land , mineral , and marine resources ; and have made it clear that same as family planning and environmental protection , the protection and a rational use of natural resources is also considered a basic national policy of our country .  
The publication and implementation of " the Provisions " indicate that China has advanced a big step in developing legal system governing public security and border patrol .  They have very important significance in demonstrating China 's efforts to strengthen the administration over vessels along the coasts , to prevent and crack down on marine crimes , and to safeguard social order along coastal regions and at sea .  
During the continuous cooperation of an electronic warfare exercise , the naval , air , and marine troops staged coordinated exercises and training on dozens of scenarios , including such naval training scenarios as firing at surface targets , launching anti-submarine rockets , launching air defense missiles , and launching an underwater anti-submarine operation , a surface interception operation , a surface search operation , a surface rescue operation , or a surface fire support operation , and so on ; 
During the combined " circum-Pacific " military exercises staged in June and July , the United States took the lead in conducting a one-week humanitarian rescue operation code-named " Strong Angel " .  Their idea is : If two neighboring nations resort to arms , a third nation ( and its allies ) will send naval forces and marine corps to prevent the war from escalating and thus ensure regional " stability " .  They will also send food , tents , and other necessities of life to the invaded nation .  
In the twilight of the 20th century , the Chinese Navy sounded its siren as it sails into the ocean of the new century : Two naval formations charted new routes of crossing both the east and west hemispheres and the north and south hemispheres on the marine chart of the world this year , with one formation crossing the Pacific and reaching the North American continent and the other formation crossing the Indian Ocean , rounding the Cape of Good Hope and sailing into the Atlantic Ocean for the first time .  
This marine brigade , which is dubbed " China 's no . 1 army , " has been set up with great care to fight and win in a future partial hi-tech war ; every one of its members has to undergo training from hell , be familiar with all kinds of weapons , be skilled in close combat , and have the ability to live off the land .  
Fishing folks along the southern Fujian coast are devout believers in the goddess Matsu and look upon her as a " strait goddess " who " makes her power felt on the sacred sea " and protects fishing folks against marine perils .  Hence , fishing folks have built by the seaside one temple after another for worshipping the goddess Matsu . On Dongshan Island you can also see such southern Fujian buildings with carved beams and walls and colorfully painted , upward tilted eaves that have been built for generations .  
A rapid response unit will join in the military exercise for the first time .  The special armed unit whose members were transferred from the Beijing Theater 's certain group army , has accomplished various assault training missions in northern China over the last two years .  The unit has been airlifted to the Fuzhou Theater by Russia-made IL-76 transport planes to join in live-fire training .  In addition , the airborne force is now in a predetermined area awaiting orders .  The marine corps has also sent a task force to take part in the war drill .  
Second stage .  The three forces will cooperate in see crossing and landing operations , including simulated missile attacks , air assaults , night airborne raids , naval and ground forces occupying islands and launching sudden attacks , the special armed unit 's sudden attacks on ports or airports , and house-to-house fighting .  This reveals that the PLA 's island-attacking pattern has begun to change from " marine landings " into " airborne assaults . "  Under the new pattern , cracks troops rather than large numbers of troops will be sent to occupy important strategic points .  
Afterwards , Su-27 fighters , " Flying Leopard " fighters , and Qiang-5 attack aircraft began their air raids .  Then , special armed units parachuted in for sudden attacks .  Shielded by destroyers , landing-craft vessels , submarines , and armored helicopters , tens of thousands of field army troops , the naval marine brigade , called as the world army No . 1 , and amphibious tanks fiercely attacked the offshore islands off Dongshan Island and Zhaoan Bays and attacked Penghu Island and Taiwan Island in a simulated manner .  
Second , we should actively promote the research of high technologies of strategic significance , and launch major and important engineering projects using new and high technologies .  To bring about a leap forward in the development of productive forces in our country , we should keep abreast of the new development trend of the world 's high technologies and related industries ; intensify our strategic studies of high technologies in such key fields as information technology , biological technology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing and automation technology , and marine technology ;  
With high functional density , short lead time , low costs , and other special features , small satellites are extensively applied to mobile communications , resources exploration , forest conflagrations , flooding , and marine monitoring , and yield social and economic benefits , becoming an important industry for countries with advanced aerospace technology .  
With its great efforts over the past 50 years , the Chinese Navy has initially built a modern marine operational force composed of the crack troops of five branches - - surface warships , submarines , naval air force , coastal guard , and the marines .  The Chinese Navy is capable of carrying out various kinds of operational tasks on coastal waters .  
The Chinese military expert held that the 21st century would be a " marine century . "  He said : It is necessary to make conscientious efforts to build a powerful and large navy and turn it into one of the major forces that protect the motherland and safeguard world peace and regional security .  
Now , it is basically provided with the capacities of conducting sea-air maneuver and conducting operations in coordination with all other armed forces .  It has played a positive role in resisting the invasion of foreign enemies , defending the security of the sea and the air , safeguarding China 's marine rights and interests , and supporting the economic construction of the state .

Rapid response units , amphibious armored units , digital artillery units , special combat units , marine corps of the navy , airborne units , and airmen of the ground force , the navy and the air force , which had gathered here , were marshaled in rank for battle .  
Tens of thousands of troops from around the country took part in the exercises , encompassing all the military regions nationwide .  Branches of the military taking part in the exercises included rapid response units , amphibious armored units , digital artillery units , special operations units , marine corps units , airborne units , Army , Navy , and Air Force aviation units , and reservist units .  
Yet , while we benefit from a rich material life and the sophisticated infrastructures we have developed , we shall never overlook the problems that come with our development .  Some of the major concerns of people at large are the air quality , marine and river pollution , and some indiscernible ecological problems .  
( d ) In general , for reclamation works where the marine mud is not dredged away , a suitable geotextile fabric is placed on top of the marine mud to contain it in position while allowing water dissipation .  It is then covered with a layer of sand to help control lateral displacement of the mud and to drain away the water dissipated from the marine mud .  Fill material is then placed on the sand in layers of uniform thickness until the reclamation is complete .  
Holders of valid Dumping Licences for public filling areas may be permitted to dump materials such as earth , building debris , broken rock and concrete at the barging point provided that the materials are free from marine mud , household refuse , plastic , metal , industrial and chemical waste , animal and vegetable matter and other materials considered unsuitable . 
She was pleased to know that later this year , after a new radar station in Mirs Bay became operative , traffic surveillance in that area would be further enhanced and that a complete upgrading of the existing VTS system had been planned for early 2000 ' s to cope with anticipated growth in marine traffic into the next century . 
For examples , he said , nowadays sea lanes were no longer dominated by traditional maritime powers , seafarers were more likely to come from Asia than Europe , trading patterns had changed , tankers and bulk carriers had grown to sizes that were unimaginable before , cargoes were moved by containers instead of carried in sacks and on pallets , the realisation of the need to tackle marine pollution and the drastic improvements in communications at sea .  
The Government 's policy objective on the environmental well-being of the community is to improve our urban , rural and marine surroundings , conserve our natural heritage , and optimise the use of resources and goods so as to reduce pollution and waste and promote health and the enjoyment of our living environment .  
The Government has also conducted a more focused site search along the entire north shore of the Hong Kong Island and having taken into account all the relevant considerations ( e.g . land availability , land-use , marine impact , etc . ) concluded that the site in North Point proposed by the private developer is the most suitable site . 
The planned GIC uses include a swimming pool complex , a sports stadium , a training school and other facilities of the Immigration Department , water-related recreational facilities / holiday camps , social welfare uses , a wholesale marine fish market , indoor recreational centres , and primary and secondary schools .  
A vessel sank between Tap Mun Chau and Chek Chau on January 1 , last year , but to date a container on the sunken vessel is still left in the sea and has not been salvaged .  Recently , the plastic waste inside that container has been flowing out from the container and drifting about in the nearby waters , resulting in the death of a substantial amount of marine fish in the fish culture zones in these waters , and causing serious damage to marine ecology .  
All modular display units are specially designed to represent the natural marine environment , depicting sandy beach , rocky shore , coral reefs and even the deep sea .  
Speaking on the project , Marine Parks Officer , Dr Cheng Wo-wing said : " The exhibition introduces to the public the beautiful seascape , the majestic coast , the tranquil marine environment and the rich and diverse marine habitat found in Hong Kong . " It serves to enhance public understanding of our marine environment and to promote the importance of its conservation . "

The audience will experience what Darwin did not - - descending to a depth of 1,000 m , exploring the deep sea that still remains veiled in mystery today .  The 40-minute long film will offer the audience the opportunity to encounter some unique creatures of the Galapagos Islands and their surrounding waters ranging from giant land tortoises , red and blue-footed boobies and other unusual birds to hammerhead and whale sharks , marine iguanas and a diversity of intriguing sea life .  
Another key success that we have had in applying EIA was the abandonment of a project which proposed the excavation of 400 million cubic metres of fill material from Mirs Bay to the east of Hong Kong : one of the most pristine , valuable marine ecosystems left in Hong Kong . EIA has saved it from destruction and preserved it for present and future generations to enjoy . 
" Entries to the photographic competition give beautiful depiction to the majestic coast , the tranquil marine environment and the rich and diverse marine habitat found in Hong Kong . " More than 70 outstanding pieces will be shown at the exhibition for the public to see , through the participants ' perception , the beauty and functions of marine parks .  " Visitors can also get a glimpse of our beautiful seascape and the mysterious underwater world , " he added .  
" Cargo material contained in the cargo hold bilge water is not treated as cargo residues provided that the cargo material is not classified as a marine pollutant in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code and the bilge water is discharged from a loaded hold through the vessel 's fixed piping bilge drainage system . "

During this marine phase , apart from intensifying its scheduled daily scavenging and refuse collection work , the MD has been carrying out special operations like collecting floating refuse at identified major marine refuse black spots including typhoon shelters and waters off gazetted and ungazetted beaches .  
The funded projects cover a wide spectrum including research into real-time bilateral teleoperation of internet based robotic systems , economic reforms and labour market transitions in urban China , studies on dendritic cell functions in chronic Chinese Hepatitis B patients , high performance non-lead piezoelectric single crystal materials , interactions of trace metals and macronutrients in marine plankton , etc .  
Mr Tupper is an expert in the maritime field .  In his current post as Assistant Director / Planning and Services , Mr Tupper is responsible for future port planning and development , cross boundary ferry terminals , harbour moorings and navigational aids , public cargo working areas , control of marine pollution , and the Hydrographic Office .  
To wild dolphins , human is the biggest threat to them apart from shark , its main predator .  Thousands of dolphins die everyday in fishing nets around the world .  What 's more , the seriously polluted environment makes dolphins increasingly vulnerable .  In view of that , many scientists , naturalists and marine biologists devote their lifetime to study dolphins , their mode of communication , foraging and social behaviors so as to preserve these graceful and extraordinary creatures .  
An environmentalist is reported to have stated that the underground drainage system in the area around Dundas Street in Mongkok has been misconnected , causing the inflow of sewage from commercial and domestic buildings into the stormwater drainage system and threatening the health of the residents in the vicinity .  As such sewage may not have undergone any treatment before it is directly discharged into the Victoria Harbour , the marine environment may be polluted .  
Milkfish Culture in Taiwan A succession of milkfish ponds can be found dotted on tidal lands in Yunlin , Chiayi , Tainan and Pingtung counties along the southwest coast of Taiwan . Milkfish , also called Bandeng or Bangos , is a silvery marine food fish collected when young and raised for food in brackish or freshwater tropical ponds .  
From the green-house effect , global climatic change , acid rain , the hole in the ozone layer , destruction of the rain forests , conservation of animal and plant species in the wild , to desertification and the shrinkage of marine mammals , all of this was very little discussed and paid scant attention .  
What Lin calls " knowing the earth " involves becoming familiar with different geographical environments . High mountains , rivers and marine islands all have their different appearances and their own special types of plants and animals ; tropical , temperate and frigid zones have their own natural conditions that can not be confused .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
Teach fishermen restraintAlthough Taiwan 's tiny community of marine scholars has already been worn thin studying ocean-dwelling mammals , NTOU , the only institution engaged in shark research , put forth a five-year plan for basic research in this area . Their goal is to understand the local shark catch situation and provide data for reference if controls are imposed in the future .  
In August this year , satellite transmitters were attached to marine turtles on Penghu ; three years ago , a Formosan black bear was released into Yushan National Park wearing a radio collar ; and the squirrels scampering through the grass and up and down the tall tropical trees of Taipei Botanical Garden have been kitted out with modern high-tech products for several years now .  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased . In addition to growing grain and vegetables , the scope of the missions has also come to include animal husbandry work-raising pigs and chickens ; marine technology-fishing techniques and the breeding and raising of marine animals ; handicraft work-bamboo weaving , wood carving ; and such areas of work as flood prevention and water conservation projects among others .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
Except for a small number of sea creatures which are attracting international attention because their numbers are dropping sharply-such as the shark , whale , and sea turtle-few marine animals are protected by law , and it is not difficult for aquariums to collect specimens . Since these then become the main selling points to attract visitors , particular attention is therefore devoted to how these precious creatures respond to their new environment .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
After work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation . But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three-kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like . Environmental protection agencies are weak , and research funding is limited . Thus there is little concrete knowledge about the numbers of various species and whether these numbers are rising or falling , not to mention any understanding of what concrete steps can be taken to solve specific problems .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
According to surveys , there are currently in excess of 100,000 belugas in the ocean . Although they are not among the most endangered animals , CITES has included them on Appendix II ( which includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction , but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival ) , both because of their numbers and because of the growing problem of marine pollution .  
" Back in the 1960s and 1970s , increasing food production was an important target of economic planning , " says former Council of Agriculture chairman Peng Tso-kwei . Developing mountain and marine food sources and developing marginal land were central to achieving this objective . The government even established a special Bureau of Mountain Agriculture and Animal Husbandry , as well as another agency to develop land reclaimed from the sea .  
An approach to marine pollution prevention " , GESAMP Report and Studies , No . 30 , 1986 .  Heavy trawls may be considered " green " on deep muddy grounds but " red " in shallow estuaries and coastal zones or coral reefs .  
As part of the effort to expand the production base for trade , island developing countries need to strengthen regional capabilities for the effective surveillance and monitoring of marine and coastal resources and activities in the exclusive economic zones .  
Such cooperation was aimed at preserving the marine environment and living resources , disposing of toxic wastes , developing coastal infrastructure and taking joint action to promote sustainable development in border areas .  The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m .  
Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Furthermore , other recent endeavours , including the 1995 Agreement on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the work of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , reflect the determination of the international community to develop and strengthen the global legal order for the sustainable development of the living and non-living resources of marine and coastal waters .  
Owing to insufficient consultations and negotiations at the Conference , reasonable views and opinions of some States that have major interests in marine fisheries failed to be duly reflected in relevant provisions .  The actual implementation of these Articles may encounter many difficulties and may increase the differences and disputes between States with conflicting interests .  
At their meeting earlier this month , the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean Community again expressed grave concern at the recurring threat posed to the region through the marine transport of irradiated nuclear fuel , plutonium and high-level radioactive wastes .  
Many species , such as migratory species , species dependent on the timing of ice-melting , Arctic communities , marine , coastal and peripheral populations , genetically impoverished species , mountain and alpine communities , and species that inhabit dry lands , semi-arid and arid ecosystems , are all likely to be adversely affected by global warming ; the climatic changes predicted may bring about catastrophic losses in genetic resources and species and ecosystem diversity .  
ECA provides advisory services and support to its member States on agriculture and rural development policies , planning and programming , with a focus on measures for the conservation of natural forests and their biodiversity , desertification and the related conservation of biodiversity , the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and green belts in targeted countries , and the strengthening of regional cooperation programmes for the optimum and sustainable use of inland and marine fisheries .  
Programmes dealing with biosafety have expanded beyond the scientific sector to include the concerns of workers exposed to biological agents in the workplace ( ILO ) , farmers ( FAO ) and the general public , while programmes on marine agricultural and industrial biotechnology call for closer cooperation among FAO , ILO , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , UNEP , UNIDO , WHO and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .  
Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , are a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Activities planned for 1996-1997 are expected to result in ( a ) a knowledge base upon which management strategies and plans can be formulated and implementation initiated to ensure the protection and sustainable development of marine and coastal areas ; and ( b ) establishment of mechanisms and policy options for the development of environmental protection and sustainable management and plans .  
Field projects . ( i ) Establishment of four port reception facilities in the Mediterranean ; ( ii ) two field projects on the assessment of threats to marine mammals ; ( iii ) one marine biodiversity assessment ; ( iv ) strengthening of four institutional arrangements for integrated coastal zone planning and management ; and ( v ) 10 projects to assist Mediterranean countries to set up their legislation concerning specially protected areas .  
Within the project on " Coastal Marine Pollution Monitoring and Training : Asia Pacific Mussel Watch " , UNU is seeking to analyse and monitor key hazardous chemicals and substances in the coastal marine areas of the Asia-Pacific region , including relative levels of important agricultural and industrial halogenated hydrocarbons in the eastern Pacific .  
" ' Damage to the Antarctic environment or dependent or associated ecosystems ' means any impact on the living or non-living components of that environment or those ecosystems , including harm to atmospheric , marine or terrestrial life , beyond that which is negligible or which has been assessed and judged to be acceptable pursuant to this Convention . "  
The Office provides legal advice and services in operational matters to United Nations organs , bodies and Secretariat units and is responsible for meeting the needs of Member States in dealing with legal , political , economic , scientific , technical and environmental aspects of the law of the sea and marine affairs .  
Their needs for coordinated information and advice will be addressed through the development and operation of a centralized system of integrated databases , inter alia , on marine legislation and marine policy , as well as by intensifying general legal advice and other advisory services and by focusing dissemination of information on national , regional and international developments in the law of the sea and ocean affairs .  
For the sustainable development of ocean resources in the context of the international ocean regime , priority will be given to the needs of States for specialized data and information for developing integrated national , subregional or regional information systems on marine areas within national jurisdiction and for putting in place appropriate legislative frameworks .  
Particular areas in which regional cooperation requires strengthening by both the Territories concerned and international agencies : preservation and protection of marine and other natural resources from over-exploitation ; transport and communications ; higher education ; research and development ; regional pooling arrangements for sharing special skills and expertise ; and assistance in the public health area ;  
Regarding protection of the marine environment , the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities , expected to be adopted at an intergovernmental conference on the subject to be held in Washington , D.C . , from 23 October to 3 November 1995 , would contribute to the effective implementation of relevant provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and various regional maritime conventions and protocols .  
To identify the crucial international conventions relating to ships and shipping operations and to implement those conventions as early as possible within an agreed harmonized framework , and take all other appropriate steps , in conjunction with established regional and international programmes , to promote maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment of ACS States , countries and territories from vessel-caused pollution ;  
Building upon earlier activities and based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the coastal and marine pollution loads from land-based sources in the eastern African subregion , including the Comoros and Seychelles , the planned development of a regional overview and strategy will lead to the implementation of various additional activities , such as monitoring programmes .

The General Assembly has proclaimed 1998 to be the International Year of the Ocean . 158 / This initiative is expected to generate important cooperative efforts in the United Nations system 159 / and stimulate greater global awareness of the oceans and greater cooperation for the effective protection and management of marine and coastal areas and resources . 
While the term " living resources " in the Convention might be broad enough to include free living and symbiotic micro-organisms , the collection and subsequent use of microbial genetic resources is not necessarily analogous to traditional methods of harvesting marine living resources .  
On the contrary , at that meeting the participants had unanimously adopted the Brisbane Declaration , which called upon France , amongst other things , to conduct a prior assessment of any major project such as nuclear testing on the marine environment , and to make its data and studies available to the international community for independent and comprehensive assessment .  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
In many cases , the unrestricted use of technology , the growing demand for goods and services from the ocean , uncontrolled population growth and continuous migration to coastal areas have led to the depletion of living resources and the degradation of the coastal and marine environment as well as of the economic conditions of some of the major sectors exploiting the ocean .  
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 called for governmental action , with the assistance of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system when required and with the active participation of the people and sectors involved and that of the non-governmental organizations , in order to : ( a ) improve the use and conservation of coastal resources through integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) ; ( b ) increase marine environmental protection from land-based and sea-based sources of pollution  
Protection of the atmosphere , in regard to : ( i ) absorption of greenhouse gases ; ( ii ) climate change and its potentially drastic effects on marine living resources ; ( iii ) energy optimization programmes and reduction of dangerous substances in exhaust gas emissions ; and ( iv ) reduction in the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) in at-sea and coastal ocean industries ; ( g ) Chapter 10 .  
Recognizing further the progress made during the post-UNCED process in developing international and regional standards and action plans relevant to the protection and management of coastal and marine environments and to the sustainable use and conservation of its resources , recommend that Governments : ( i ) continue to use existing mechanisms and forums to foster further progress ; ( ii ) actively participate in regional action plans , programmes and other cooperative arrangements ; and ( iii ) take advantage of international collaboration , particularly in the area of financing ;  
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
Other specific areas that have been mentioned as deserving future attention include , inter alia , persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals ( preparatory work initiated for developing protocols to the 1979 ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution ) ; joint implementation and tradable permits ; protection of marine biodiversity ; protection of inland waters ; protection of the soils ; mountain ecosystems ; introduction of genetically modified and alien organisms ; child labour ; and environmental impact assessment .  
The aforementioned 1972 London Dumping Convention for the prevention of marine pollution by waste dumping has been significantly strengthened by amendments in 1993 banning the dumping of radioactive , industrial and incineration wastes ; a new protocol under discussion would ban all marine disposal except in specific cases that could be shown to have no adverse environmental impacts .  
Decisions on questions affecting the marine environment must be the result of an integrated approach , taking into account all relevant environmental , social and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing countries , as well as the best available scientific evidence .  
The Working Group also stressed the need for increased support for training and capacity-building in the field of integrated management of coastal areas , and stressed the need for taking action to protect all critical habitats of marine living resources in the coastal zone , including coral reefs , mangroves , mudflats and estuaries .  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
As regards the subprogramme on environmental law , institutions and policies , over 10 additional intergovernmental meetings were convened on issues relating to the protection of marine environment from land-based sources of pollution ; the Lusaka Agreement on cooperative enforcement operations directed at illegal trade in wild fauna and flora ; military activities and the environment ; and African Ministerial Conference on the Environment .  
As stated in the aide-m \ x { 5e66 } oire transmitted to the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Buenos Aires on 27 February 1996 , the Argentine Republic reiterates that the only rules applicable to the utilization of Antarctic marine living resources in the area adjacent to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are those laid down in the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and such rules adopted by the Commission established under the Convention as are currently in force .  
Establish cooperative mechanisms with global , regional and national organizations involved in marine geological and geophysical data collection , in particular , data related to the bathymetry , macro - and microtopographical data of the Area ;  
Island developing countries should seek to exploit fully , within the limits of sustainability , their agricultural potential and marine resources in the exclusive economic zones by enhancing relevant skills and carrying out specialized studies on the conservation , management and surveillance of these resources .  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Furthermore , international law permits the coastal State to conduct only marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone , not " any kind of research " , as stated in article 14 , subparagraph ( b ) ( ii ) , of the aforementioned Iranian Act .  
They reaffirmed that the Convention and the agreements represented significant achievements of the international community through multilateral efforts in creating a legal order for the seas and the oceans that will , inter alia , facilitate international communications , promote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans , the equitable and efficient utilization of their resources , the conservation of their living resources and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
The fundamental importance of the law of the sea institutions for international peace and security , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the sustainable development of marine resources and the protection of the environment has allowed them to evolve successfully , despite the increasing financial difficulties for Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  
Being a comprehensive instrument also , the Convention holds considerable " strategic importance . . . as a framework for national , regional and global action in the marine sector " ( resolution 49 / 28 , preamble ) , with further implications , in turn , for the manner in which the system of ocean institutions will evolve , in particular the core institutions established by the Convention . 
The coastal State may , pursuant to article 211 ( 6 ) , under the conditions stipulated therein , adopt special mandatory laws and regulations for the prevention , reduction and control of marine pollution in a clearly defined area in its exclusive economic zone where such special laws and regulations are required for recognized technical reasons in relation to its oceanography , ecology , resource use and maritime traffic conditions .  
According to Indonesia , the proposed axis lines are the result of years of careful study of various factors , such as : the need of international transportation and aviation in transiting Indonesian waters ; the hydrographic and natural marine conditions in and near the relevant axis lines ; the intensity of coastal and inter-island navigation and overflight ; the intensity of fishing activities , particularly of local artisanal fishermen ; the existence of oil and gas exploration and exploitation ;  
It expressly recognizes , and indeed mandates , the need for further elaboration of international rules , standards and recommended practices and procedures for marine environmental protection at the global and regional levels , but at the same time ensures that these more specialized processes are guided by its basic structure .  
Among other actions , the Subcommittee agreed that the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities would be considered as the cooperative programme framework for programme areas A ( integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ) and B ( i ) ( marine environmental protection : land-based sources ) .  
While this new instrument has no binding character , it rests on a firm international legal basis , most particularly on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , 169 and also on the 1972 London Convention , particularly in the light of its forthcoming amendment , and on the numerous regional instruments for the protection of the marine environment against land-based activities , including most recently the revised Protocol on Protection of the Mediterranean Sea from Pollution by Land-based Sources and Activities ( March 1996 ) .  
The topic touches not only on the protection and preservation of the marine environment , including that of the international seabed area , but also on such other matters as the application of the consent regime for marine scientific research , the regime for protected areas in the exclusive economic zone , the duties of conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas , and the sustainable development of living marine resources generally .  
The group of experts on marine and coastal biodiversity , established pursuant to decision II / 10 of the Second Conference of Parties , has not been able to meet as planned ; however , the first step has been achieved in drawing up a roster of nominated experts from which the group will be composed .  
SBSTTA has recommended that this expert group should concentrate on determining the following areas where the Biodiversity Convention can have the greatest effect : integrated marine and coastal area management , marine and coastal protected areas , sustainable use of coastal and marine living resources , mariculture and alien species . 193 Other items of particular note discussed by SBSTTA included the economic valuation of biological diversity and its components , in particular in relation to access to genetic resources ( art . 15 of the Convention ) .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
Establish cooperative mechanisms with global , regional and national organizations involved in marine geological and geophysical data collection , in particular , data related to the bathymetry , macro - and micro-topographical data of the Area ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
While bilateral aid from donor countries , support from governmental agencies , assistance from international agencies , international development and aid institutions have an important role in supplementing national and regional endeavours in this regard , it is essential that due importance be given to development mechanisms that are better able to cope with the transboundary movement of marine resources and to address the transboundary nature of marine environmental problems .  
The draft resolution before us on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing , unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction and fisheries by-catch and discards draws attention to a number of damaging practices that continue to threaten a sustainable future for the world 's living marine resources .  
At the national level my country has pursued for some years a solid , viable , scientifically based programme to ensure the sustainability of tuna fishing and to guarantee the preservation of all living marine resources .  
This is a demonstration of our firm commitment to the principles contained in those instruments : multilateralism , the responsible utilization of renewable resources to ensure the continued availability of a valuable source of protein , employment for our people , the effective preservation of marine mammals and the use of science to protect a complex and delicate ecosystem .  
It proposes the establishment of a new oceanic order in the twenty-first century , as well as the joint management and scientific development of marine resources on an equitable and peaceful basis so as to maintain the ecological balance of oceans and achieve the sustainable development of marine resources .  It calls on States parties to the Convention to strengthen cooperation and establish joint management and development zones of marine resources .  
The 1982 Convention , although the most universal and extensive instrument on the law of the sea , nevertheless can not fully reflect the growing concern of coastal States at the state of living marine resources , which often fall victim to uncontrolled and scientifically unsound harvesting on the high seas .  
The Congress provided a superb and unique opportunity for representatives of the merchant marine industry and collateral fields to describe to future interested parties how the Panama Canal works and thus give them a complete understanding of what lies ahead for the Canal .  
The region \ x { e5b8 } constant focus on democracy , good governance , peace , security and nuclear disarmament ; its undertaking to take responsibility for the proper and responsible management of the environment ; the protection of fish and other marine resources ; cultural and technology exchanges ; and economic cooperation and respect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone is successfully dealing with a changing global environment .  
Future international action should address the oceans , particularly the sustainable use of marine resources through improved environmental approaches to marine ecology ; the protection and sustainable use of fresh water and wetland habitats , particularly in arid regions ; the protection and sustainable use of forests and woodlands ; and the problems of hazardous chemicals .  
Furthermore , they have established programmes to develop the principles of the CBD and facilitate their implementation : on coastal and marine biodiversity ; forest biodiversity ; agricultural biodiversity ; the biodiversity of inland waters ; the rights of indigenous and local communities under the CBD ; and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity .  
In particular , Parties have through the CBD been actively pursuing a strategy of establishing the legal basis to ensure the integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources under national jurisdiction ( programme area D ) .  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level and low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people and the marine environment or does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
Urge all SAARC countries to preserve rare , fragile , ecologically sensitive coastal and marine ecosystems , such as mangroves , coral reefs , sea-grass beds , etc . , for conservation and sustainable use of the resources under national jurisdiction .  
Continuing the international dialogue on the issues of conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity and agricultural biological diversity was also very important , since both issues were essential to food security , which was the focus of the forthcoming World Food Summit ; the work being undertaken by the Intergovernmental Panel on forests was likewise crucial to that discussion .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Many countries , including Peru , are currently facing a cyclical , worldwide natural phenomenon known as El Ni �� , whose severe economic , environmental and social consequences are drastically changing the marine environment , which is a source of food and employment for broad sectors of humankind .  
In this regard , it should be emphasized that the Jakarta Mandate covering the following areas : integrated marine and coastal area management ; marine and coastal protected areas ; sustainable use of marine and coastal living resources ; and mariculture and alien species called , inter alia , for the effective implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity concerning marine and coastal biodiversity questions .  
Another significant event in the international community 's quest to apply the rule of law in relations between States in marine affairs was the successful completion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea of its judicial organizational phase , despite operating with a modest budget and a tiny staff under its President , Thomas Mensah .  
These documents have established a legal order governing the ocean space which will contribute to the exploration of the sea for peaceful purposes and the equitable and efficient utilization of marine resources and facilitate the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order .  
It is obvious that without a comprehensive sustainable energy strategy , global warming will continue unabated , urban air with continue to deteriorate and marine pollution will not be halted .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
The main issues that have emerged during SBSTTA sessions have been detailed technical issues , such as how to promote access to and transfer of technology , the development of monitoring systems and assessments , and issues dealing with agricultural , terrestrial , marine and coastal biodiversity and traditional knowledge .  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
The Penal Code lays down offences of an ecological nature , dealing , for example , with the unlawful destruction of raw materials , trees , agricultural or industrial products or means of production , such destruction being detrimental to national wealth or consumption , as well as with the protection of mammals or marine vertebrates and aquatic species .  
Spain reported on initiatives to combat marine pollution , including the control and monitoring of maritime transport of pollutant products that may have an impact on the environment ; the prevention of pollution from ships ; the monitoring and control of industrial waste or waste from ships ; and active participation in the implementation of specific maritime safety plans in each port , taking into account current provisions including those of the National Regulation for the Admission , Handling and Storage of Hazardous Goods in Ports .  
IMO forwarded a document entitled " Status of international conventions relating to marine pollution of which IMO is depositary or responsible for secretariat duties " , which provided information of relevance to the issues of concluded bilateral and multilateral treaties , including legislation to ensure their implementation , and information on the status of implementation of international conventions at the national level .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
We also recognized that the problems of the environment , such as global warming , the destruction of coastal and marine ecosystems , the degradation of forests , desertification and the overuse of mineral resources are concerns not of any one nation or continent , but of the entire international community .  
We are deeply convinced that such an approach will increase the responsibility of each littoral State for the consequences of activities in its own sector ; make possible the effective legal regulation of the use of marine resources on the basis of national legislation ; make it easier to attract foreign investment to the region , which in turn will contribute to the region 's economic growth ; and minimize the likelihood of disputes among States concerning specific deposits in the Caspian Sea .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the sustainable management , conservation and enhancement , as appropriate , of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , including biomass , forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial , coastal and marine ecosystems .  
We have to address as a matter of priority the three most immediate dangers identified by the Commission : the overexploitation of marine biological resources , the dumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global warming .  
We continue to be concerned at the threat to the fragile marine environment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear and other hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
In order to curb rapid loss of biodiversity , the deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled so as to reverse the serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
To curb rapid loss of biodiversity , deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled to reverse the continuing serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
These were responsible for the greater part of the landed catch of the worlds marine fisheries and were the main contributors to the global annual average of 28-million tons of discarded by-catch .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
In the Caribbean , in collaboration with selected regional institutions , OAS is currently providing technical assistance for the execution of three major projects : assessment of coastal and marine problems ; assessment of the current state of effluent disposal in the region ; and comprehensive review of integrated coastal zone management legislative systems .  
The Coastal Module Panel of GOOS has begun the design of optimal monitoring and forecasting systems for coastal seas , focusing on preserving healthy coastal environments , promoting sustainable use of resources , mitigating coastal hazards , and enabling safe and efficient marine operations .  
The Global Programme of Action states at the outset that its implementation will require new approaches by and new forms of collaboration among Governments , organizations and institutions with responsibilities and expertise relevant to marine and coastal areas , at all levels national , regional and global including the promotion of innovative financial mechanisms to generate needed resources .  
The disposal of untreated effluents into surrounding areas of land and sea often leads to the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , loss of valuable marine life , destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
Stress the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
Contributing factors to the marine environmental deterioration include oil exploration and exploitation , rapid economic growth , overfishing , physical alteration of the coastlines by dredging and filling , discharge of raw sewage , disposal of untreated industrial effluents , and dumping wasted oil and debris .  
Enhanced national capacity for integrating environmental considerations into economic and social policies ; improvement of energy efficiency and conservation potentials ; wider application of renewable energy technologies ; formulation and implementation of integrated development and management policies in the water , mineral and marine resources sectors ; natural disaster preparedness and mitigation ; and application of space technology through human resources development activities ;  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
Invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities ;  
One of the most important challenges being tackled by Ukrainian specialists is to study the seas surface , atmospheric and oceanic dynamics , and marine temperatures and colours by means of satellite data , such research constituting a basic component of environmental monitoring and surveillance of navigational hazards .  
The Commission invited all organizations concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider whether their programmes of work provided sufficient consideration of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review what needed to be done to ensure adequate prediction and understanding of the impacts on coastal and marine areas of phenomena such as El Nio .  
It is also keeping the U . S . marine units based in Okinawa , Japan , and the aircraft carrier Constellation , F-15 tactical fighters , B-52 strategic bombers and EA-6B electronic warfare aircraft based in its mainland on standby for rapid deployment in south Korea .  
Promoting the formulation , adoption and implementation of appropriate technical , institutional , administrative and legal measures contributing to improved protection of marine and coastal environment , including the rational use and conservation of their resources .  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
In the area of geological map configuration , the combined working methods of remote sensing technology and large-scale multi-picture surveys have reduced the actual costs by one third and the length of field survey routes by about one half compared with conventional methods .  Remote sensing technology has also been applied in archaeology , prospecting , railway and highway construction and marine information services .  
The main applications of this technology are to be found in the following fields : air and marine navigation , telecommunications , economic and social development , national capacity-building in formulating strategies geared to sustainable development and in solving problems in the fields of health and education , in the environmental sphere and in the areas of prevention and disaster relief .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Formulation of policies , strategies and measures to address fisheries needs , including the urgent need to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , to ensure essential sources of food supplies for island populations , and economic development ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
Given IMOs global regulatory mandate , which encompasses the development of international rules and standards designed to enhance the safety of life at sea and protect the marine environment from pollution caused by ships , the twin fundamentals of sustainable development and poverty alleviation have evolved in recent years as parallel concerns to the Organization .  
GOOS aims to meet the need for : ( a ) forecasting climate variability and change ; ( b ) assessing the state of health of the marine environment and its resources ( including the coastal zone ) ; and ( c ) supporting an improved decision-making and management process which takes into account potential natural and man-made changes in the environment and their effects on human health and resources .  
Our rich flora and fauna , marine life , mineral wealth and human potential is unparalleled , and this God-given untapped wealth can best be developed not by a single country but by our Mano River Union .  
e .  Marine environment assessments : global and regional assessments of the state of the marine environment ; global and regional assessments of marine mammals , including identification of endangered and threatened marine mammal species ; and rapid assessment methodology for coral reefs ( international coral reef initiative ) ;  
The Caribbean region and sea possessed a number of unique features which justified according them priority attention : exceptional biological diversity , highly fragile ecosystems and heavy reliance by most of the countries of the region on the coastal land and marine environment in order to achieve sustainable development .  
In my delegation ' s view , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a fundamental means of ensuring the peaceful and sustainable use and development of the oceans and their resources , through , in particular , the promotion of international cooperation , the equitable and efficient utilization and preservation of living marine resources , and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Formulation of policies , strategies and measures to address fisheries needs , including the urgent need to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , to ensure essential sources of food supplies for island populations , and economic development ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
These States are confronted with major challenges , such as protecting the marine environment against various forms of pollution , the increasing scarcity of fresh water , ever more frequent and devastating natural disasters , adapting to climate change and to the rising sea level , integrating into the global economy , and the diversification of their exports .  
The need for universal commitment to such preventive measures has become more pressing due to the isolation and oceanic location of some small island developing States and their total dependence on a marine and limited terrestrial base , which render them highly vulnerable to contamination from such waste .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
The Commission emphasizes the fundamental fact that oceans and seas constitute the major part of the planet that supports life , drive the climate and hydrological cycle , and provide the vital resources to be used to ensure well-being for present and future generations and economic prosperity , to eradicate poverty , to ensure food security and to conserve marine biological diversity and its intrinsic value for maintaining the conditions that support life on earth . 
The Commission urges support , upon the request of the State concerned , for national efforts to gain greater access to resource information and to develop appropriate policies to facilitate the exploration and exploitation , with the States consent and in a manner consistent with the sustainability of marine living resources , of non-living marine resources within its exclusive economic zones , or to the outer limits of the continental shelf , wherever applicable .  
Stresses the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , including the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
Invites all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction and coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as the El Nio phenomenon .  
The Commission invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities .  
The disposal of untreated effluents into surrounding areas of land and sea often leads to the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , loss of valuable marine life , destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
In terms of programme areas covered by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received larger shares were human resource development , transport and communication , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources , and energy resources .  
In short , the draft convention merely serves to protect the interests of developed countries , such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America , which have long _ standing international maritime traditions or a large merchant marine fleet and , consequently , wish to protect their ships from the calamity of arrest , which would prevent them from operating .  
Where untreated effluents are disposed into surrounding areas of land and sea , the result often is the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , the loss of valuable marine life , the destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
A number of initiatives have been taken by Governments , in all parts of the world to : ( a ) develop national strategies or master plans for sustainable development of tourism ; ( b ) develop appropriate regulatory mechanisms and tools , such as environmental assessment and the development of building regulations and environmental standards for tourism ; ( c ) create terrestrial and marine protected areas ; and ( d ) support voluntary initiatives by the tourism industry .  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
At the regional level , ongoing activities conducive to the sustainable management of coastal and marine resources include training of personnel , acquisition of equipment and facilities , production of stock assessment data and other resource inventories , upgrading of skills for management of marine parks , studies on pollution , information exchange and sharing of experience from within and outside the regions , and production of ICAM plans using regional guidelines .  
Small island developing States also have been the recipients of formal and informal training efforts to improve their capacity to implement sustainable coastal and marine resource management from regional and international institutions .  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
The present section summarizes , by region and by sea , the main priorities and challenges , developments in decision-making , and activities at the national level to promote integrated coastal zone management , marine environment protection , and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources .  
Parts of the region are also concerned about increased mineral loading in marine estuaries from upstream , intensive paddy cultivation and the conversion of intertidal zones ( i.e . , salt marsh and mangrove ) to rice paddy .  
New Zealand provided a variety of examples on technology innovations , including the use of wool booms in residual oil spill clean-ups , oil-eating microbes , development of captive breeding programmes for shellfish , experimental wave and tidal energy generation , and development of pharmaceutical and natural health products from marine sources , such as sponges .  
The major concerns of the Russian Federation ( 97 , 99 ) are the recently established state marine boundaries ( changing geopolitical situation ) , a worsening economic situation , increasing international competition for property rights on ocean zones and resources , and absence of a mechanism for interregional and intersectoral coordination in oceanic projects .  
The major interests at the international level are the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources and pollution by dumping of waste , protection of the sensitive environment of the Arctic Ocean , and exchange of scientific information on the oceans and its living resources .  
In terms of coverage of programme areas at the global level by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received large shares were human resources development , transport and communications , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources and energy resources .  
We are of the view that illegal , unregulated , unreported fishing activities have a severe adverse impact on the effectiveness of measures for the sustainable management and exploitation of marine living resources .  
CARICOM member States have for many years expressed growing concern at the increasing threat to our marine environment posed by pollution and by the transportation of hazardous and nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines , international aviation and marine bunker fuel emissions , based upon fuel sold to ships or aircraft engaged in international transport , should not be included in national totals , but reported separately .  
By the same token , the rest of the world can not ignore the unique contribution of small island developing States to global sustainability , through their rich biodiversity , their vast areas of marine resources and their coral reef systems .  
Those delegations expressed the view that such re-entry constituted a serious threat to human security and the economic activities of coastal States and threatened the marine environment and its natural resources .  
Noting the importance that the global meetings of regional seas conventions and action plans have taken as a consultative mechanism for the revitalization of Regional Seas Programme , including the strengthening of partnerships with international organizations dedicated to marine and coastal issues and the establishment of programmatic linkages with global environmental conventions and related agreements ,  
The States members of MERCOSUR and the associated countries considered that the strictest safety requirements should be observed in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , which posed great danger to the marine environment and the health of populations in affected areas .  
The basic consent provision is contained in article 246 , paragraphs 1 and 2 , whereby the coastal State in the exercise of its jurisdiction has the right to regulate , authorize and conduct marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone and on its continental shelf in accordance with relevant provisions of the Convention .  
Under article 272 , there is a particular duty to coordinate activities of international programmes : States are to endeavour to ensure that international organizations competent in the field of transfer of marine technology coordinate their activities , including any regional or global programmes , taking into account the interests and needs of developing States , particularly landlocked and geographically disadvantaged States .  
The aim of the Recommendations for Guidance is to define the biological , chemical , geological and physical components to be measured and the procedures to be followed by the Contractor to ensure the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects which may arise from its activities in the Area , and to provide guidance to prospective contractors in preparing plans of work for exploration for polymetallic nodules .  
In the context of establishing the limits of an extended continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles , the vast non-living marine resources that are known to occur on and beneath the deep seabed of the Pacific Ocean provide further opportunities that could provide the Pacific Island Forum States with an additional measure of economic independence .  
Recognize also the special needs of regional and subregional ecosystems , including arid and semi-arid , mountain , forest , marine , aquatic and island ecosystems , which are rich and diverse but generally fragile as well , together with the importance of ensuring their conservation , protection and sustainable use .  
Data received from the SAC-C satellite are used to study the terrestrial and marine environment , assess desertification , monitor flooding , forecast agricultural production , monitor the atmospheric temperature and vapour content of water with a view to determining the variability of the atmospheric structure , perform measurements of the geomagnetic field with the same level of accuracy attained by observatories , measure atmospheric space radiation and its effects on advanced electronic components , determine the migratory route of the southern right whale and verify methods used in determining satellite attitude and velocity .  
Climate change had , among other things , increased the scarcity and diminished the quality of fresh water and had contributed to the degradation of coastal zones and marine ecosystems in all CARICOM member countries , which therefore continued to seek the support of the United Nations for a special regime for the Caribbean Sea .
