Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .

Although hotel chairman Lin Shih-jung has already stated that under the present circumstances he has no choice but to close down the hotel , the incident has drawn attention to the illegal use of mountain slope land and to the issue of safety in the tourism industry .

In 1994 and 1995 , the question of whether Japan should take on a greater military role in Asia stirred intense controversy in many Asian countries .

In stating his opposition , he told of his own terrifying experiences during the Japanese occupation of Singapore , and even spoke of a dark side to Japanese culture .

FPG moved quickly to clarify the situation , and later stated that there had indeed been deficiencies in the selection of the company to which it had contracted disposal of the waste .

But despite these actions , FPG 's image as a pragmatic and responsible company has been severely tarnished .  
At the tenth anniversary of Tiananmen , preventive measures by the mainland authorities made substantive attacks against the government impossible . But participants in a symposium on " The May Fourth Movement and 20th-Century China " at Peking University in early May could scarcely fail to expand on the stated theme , to touch on the currently most sensitive topics of democracy , human rights and freedom which were the issues behind Tiananmen . Hence the symposium was full of the sense that " all history is contemporary history . "  
The Philippine negation of the sovereignty of the Republic of China on Taiwan offended the ROC 's national honor and caused a public outcry here . In the following two months , the Philippines unilaterally cut Taiwan 's weekly passenger quota to 3,000 and sent notice that it would terminate the aviation accord as of October 1 . With dialogue breaking down , Taiwan finally announced the suspension of air links on October 1 . It stated that negotiations for a new aviation agreement could only begin after the old accord had been recognized and respected .

"  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
On 24 March the Council of Grand Justices , which had been asked to examine the constitutionality of the assembly 's extension of its own term of office , ruled that the measure was invalid .

In contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , Annette Lu has emphasized " soft national power .

If Taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such " soft power , " one day the United Nations will turn around and want Taiwan to join .  
The case has elicited the concern of human rights groups around the world . The London headquarters of Amnesty International , which describes the convictions as " the judicial ruling of an uncivilized nation , " has organized several support campaigns for the three men , and last May sent representatives to Taiwan , where they called a press conference and stated , " If Taiwan 's government intends to make human rights a trump card of its foreign policy , it should first grant clemency to the Hsichih trio . "  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .

Full of enthusiasm for this plan , Hsien Wen-chu specially returned to Taiwan to visit NCF executive director Rebecca Wang , but the response he received was a disheartening one . Wang said that because at the time there was an intense public debate going in Taiwan about the need for charities to use funds for the purpose for which they had been donated , and donors to the NCF had not explicitly stated that their donations were to be used for overseas assistance , the foundation had to be cautious in how it used its funds .  
Even more encouraging to Taiwan 's medical community is the public support voiced last May by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , Tommy G . Thompson . At an address delivered to a luncheon meeting of the World Medical Association , he stated that promoting world health is a task that should transcend political boundaries , and while the US is aware that Taiwan 's entry into the WHO is a controversial issue , the US will not shrink from taking a public position on the matter .

The view was also expressed that subparagraphs ( a ) and 2 ( b ) were in blatant contradiction with article 14 , paragraph 7 , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and that account should also be taken of the fact that the purpose of an international criminal court was to be complementary to national criminal justice systems , as stated in the preamble to the draft statute .

Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge .

But despite these actions , FPG 's image as a pragmatic and responsible company has been severely tarnished .

Hence the symposium was full of the sense that " all history is contemporary history . "  
The Philippine negation of the sovereignty of the Republic of China on Taiwan offended the ROC 's national honor and caused a public outcry here . In the following two months , the Philippines unilaterally cut Taiwan 's weekly passenger quota to 3,000 and sent notice that it would terminate the aviation accord as of October 1 .

"  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .

Full of enthusiasm for this plan , Hsien Wen-chu specially returned to Taiwan to visit NCF executive director Rebecca Wang , but the response he received was a disheartening one . Wang said that because at the time there was an intense public debate going in Taiwan about the need for charities to use funds for the purpose for which they had been donated , and donors to the NCF had not explicitly stated that their donations were to be used for overseas assistance , the foundation had to be cautious in how it used its funds .  
Even more encouraging to Taiwan 's medical community is the public support voiced last May by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , Tommy G . Thompson . At an address delivered to a luncheon meeting of the World Medical Association , he stated that promoting world health is a task that should transcend political boundaries , and while the US is aware that Taiwan 's entry into the WHO is a controversial issue , the US will not shrink from taking a public position on the matter .
