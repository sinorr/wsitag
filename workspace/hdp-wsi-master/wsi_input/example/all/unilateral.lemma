Such a practice is a covert unilateral nuclear arms expansion in essence , which not only is unfavorable to the safeguarding of the global strategic balance and stability , but will also shake the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear nonproliferation .  
The move in fact represents unilateral nuclear arms build-up in disguised form .  The move will not only bring severe damage to the integrity and vitality of the ABM treaty and the global strategic balance and stability , but will also seriously disrupt the basis for the US-Russia bilateralnuclear reductions , impede the international nuclear disarmament process , thus shatter the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear non-proliferation .  
Even more serious , the " ABM Treaty " is built on the basis of the theory of relative security ; it brought about relative balance of US and Soviet nuclear offensive and defensive forces through " mutually assured destruction " and prevented either side from carrying out a preemptive nuclear strike , while the US NMD is aimed at achieving its unilateral absolute military superiority and absolute security .  
It is worth pondering that after this multinational joint exercise , this naval task fleet of India did not leave the region , but on the contrary continued to stay there .  Moreover , it was joined by one more " Kilo " class submarine and several antisubmarine patrol aircrafts to continue their unilateral naval exercise .  
Adapting itself to the trend of the times and the actual situation in its own region , it has developed a unique APEC mode , which recognizes diversification , allows flexibility , upholds the principle of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , consensus through consultation , seeking common grounds while reserving differences , and independent and voluntary participation , and integrate unilateral and collective actions on trade and investment liberalization . 
He said : Russia and the United States are shouldering the special responsibility of safeguarding world peace and stability and building a new international security framework .  All this needs efforts to conduct close bilateral cooperation and international cooperation .  Any unilateral action may make solutions for modern social problems difficult .  
Because the " Red Army " and the " Blue Army " compete with each other without knowing the other side 's manpower deployment , battle approaches , and tactical motives , their tactical training has therefore altered from a unilateral combined training to a realistic actual-troops confrontation , thus changing the mode of our military 's exercise , in which the " Red Army " used to win every battle .  
He said : By adopting a foreign policy of going our own way , the Bush Administration will disrupt international security , hurt our economic and environmental protection interests , and stop a historical chance for us to agree with China and Russia on limiting weapons and reducing nuclear weapons .  " These examples demonstrate that a country 's unilateral actions can not possibly form a lasting strategic framework that has the submission of all other countries . "  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
The proposed three mini links between the two shores represents a decisionmaking mode most representative of characteristics of the new government .  The MAC deems it possible to attain such a " goal " as forging " links " between the two shores through its unilateral , one-sided , and subjective move and without holding negotiations or consultations or even signing an agreement with the other shore .  Obviously , it has treated the other shore as a non-existent " suppositional adversary . "  This unique way of " creating links " is indeed rare in the world .  
By listing themselves overseas , China 's enterprises are not only able to raise funds for faster development , but also make use the listing to change the original unilateral capital structure of sole government ownership .  With the change of capital structure , it is able to develop enterprises under the mixed form of ownership with the participation of foreign investment , establish a corporate legal person management structure with diversified investments , and further build a modern enterprise system .  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
The same representative stressed the importance of emphasizing the repercussions on women of unilateral economic measures of a coercive nature which are , at times , applied against developing countries for political reasons .  
Future work on trade and environment must be aimed at developing an agreed framework for the use of necessary legitimate , transparent and predictable measures for environmental objectives while preventing unilateral and arbitrary green protectionism .  
At the intergovernmental level , it had become widely recognized that the drug problem could not be tackled on a unilateral or even a bilateral basis but , being global in nature , would require extended and improved international cooperation .  
On the contrary , in a wide range of forums we have rejected unilateral coercive measure that affect the well-being of peoples , hamper free trade , and are alien to universally recognized commercial practices .  
The Heads of State or Government called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba , which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the United Nations Charter , international law and the principle of good neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage .  
In accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , as well as those of the World Trade Organization and of international law , and also in accordance with resolutions of the General Assembly , we reject the unilateral coercive measures that affect the well-being of Ibero-America peoples , impede free exchange and universally accepted transparent trade practices and violate the principles governing regional coexistence and the sovereignty of States .  
Any discriminatory trading practice , any imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic laws hampers this process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the standards of international law and the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations .  
The arrogant approach and attitude of the Government of the United States of America towards the international community , and the unsuccessful attempts of the American foreign policy establishment to exploit issues of global concern , such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , to advance an extraneous and illegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed dangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral measures .  
In addition , at a time when the North-South gap continues to widen on a daily basis , the world economic trend , manipulated by unilateral actions and protectionist policies on the part of the developed countries , also tends further to debilitate the potential of the developing countries to deal with the adverse impacts of international economic development .  
For our part , in addition to supporting the Assembly resolutions on the subject , we have declared a unilateral moratorium on mine production , and with regard to a case which affects us directly the mines planted by our armed forces on the Malvinas Islands in 1982 we have offered our cooperation and financial help to the United Kingdom for their removal , which is proceeding with the greatly appreciated cooperation of the United States .  
In concrete terms , that means concluding quickly the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( CTBT ) ; it means an energetic effort to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes ; and it means an effort to transform unilateral declarations on negative security assurances into legally binding treaty obligations . 
Depending upon circumstances , it should be comprehensive or specific , global or regional , unilateral , bilateral or multilateral , separate or interconnected , step-by-step but part of a grand strategy always mutually complementary pieces of one mosaic .  
Those Governments that are thus accused of failure to live up to international humanitarian standards are subjected to unilateral arms embargoes imposed on them by the arms - exporting countries , whereas the perpetrators of violence who procure their weapons , perhaps from the very same sources , are never held accountable for their illegal and destabilizing activities .  
They stressed that the existing assurances and unilateral declarations fell far short of the credible assurances sought by non-nuclear-weapon States and that , in order to be effective , the assurances should be unconditional , without qualification , not subject to divergent interpretation and unlimited in scope , application and duration . 
The Working Group recognized that joint studies on some form of international cooperation , keeping in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , could help overcome concerns about international competitiveness as a result of unilateral implementation of domestic policy reforms aimed at promoting sustainable development .  
Several delegations stressed the need to ensure adequate resources for strengthening activities under programme 12 pertaining to the continuing economic and social transformation in countries with economies in transition and the reporting to the General Assembly and to the Security Council on the implementation of multilateral economic sanctions on the effects of unilateral economic coercive measures .  
The use of unilateral coercive economic measures as a means of exercising political and economic pressure against developing countries constitutes a grave violation of the human rights of individuals , groups and people recognized in the Charter of the United Nations and in all international human rights instruments . 
The stated policy objectives in specific cases of coercive economic measures reflect a broad range of options based on unilateral judgements by the sender State , and express specific interests .  
The promulgation by the United States of America of laws and regulations imposing an unjust embargo on the Cuban people constitutes a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations since it has the purpose of achieving unilateral political objectives that bear no relation to international peace and security .  This embargo is , moreover , incompatible with the most elementary humanitarian and moral standards .  
The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania has consistently rejected any unilateral promulgation and application of laws such as those referred to in resolution 49 / 9 because such measures are inconsistent with the general principles of international law and violate the provisions of Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular paragraph 2 on developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
It was a matter of concern that some developed countries continued to impose unilateral protectionist measures and to create new types of protectionism , such as environmental labelling and social clauses , that would have an adverse impact on economic growth and development in the developing countries . 
is evident that the continuation of this kind of irresponsible unilateral conduct and arrogant behaviour by the United States Government will set an alarming precedent with far-reaching adverse implications for international peace and security and create uncertainty and insecurity in international relations , for which the United States alone must bear full responsibility .  
With regard to the matter of the extraterritoriality of national laws , a most sensitive issue for peoples and Governments the world over , the Rio Group summit meeting expressed its rejection of any attempt to use a country 's domestic legislation to impose unilateral sanctions of an extraterritorial character , as this contravenes the standards governing coexistence between States , disregards the fundamental principle of respect for sovereignty and is a clear violation of international law .  
In this setting , on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , we observed and took part in a series of momentous statements on the universal nature of this Organization , as well as the formulation of solemn commitments to the principles and purposes that have guided and should continue to guide the future work of the United Nations . However , predictably , during the past year the purposes and principles that have guided us for over 50 years have once again undergone unilateral interpretation . 
The United Nations will not be strong and effective if it allows cardinal principles of international law , such as respect for sovereignty , the territorial integrity of States and the right of States freely to choose their political , economic and social system , to succumb to unilateral political interests and the imposition of models .  
While that communiqu , among other things , calls for strengthening economic and monetary cooperation and for the provision of necessary multilateral support for development , it is astonishing to witness how one of the members of that group , in total disregard of those stated purposes , which are relevant issues to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit , and in pursuance of its own short-sighted and politically motivated interests , vehemently imposes unilateral coercive measures through the adoption of legislation with extraterritorial effects against other countries .  
The evident behavioural characteristics of this menace , disguised behind appealing facades , can be summarized in the following manner : first , there is unilateralism , which means a total lack of commitment to mutual cooperation and common solutions , and complete reliance on unilateral measures in various fields .  
Recent unilateral sanctions enacted by the United States against the trading partners of a number of countries not only constitute a grave breach of various norms and principles of international law and many resolutions of this Assembly and other international forums as well as blatant interference in the internal and external affairs of other States , but , indeed , point to a very dangerous trend , which undermines the very foundations of contemporary inter-State relations .  
In the same negotiations , insistence on unilateral , non-transparent national technical means as opposed to a multilateral and transparent international monitoring system created a major obstacle for consensus .  
The application of unilateral measures that ignore the growing negative opinion of the international community can not constitute a solid foundation for a peaceful and secure coexistence , ruled by law .  
The efforts of developing countries in carrying out trade and macroeconomic reforms aimed at sustained economic growth can be impeded by the use of unilateral actions by major economies , in particular those with extraterritorial effects .  
Any discriminatory trade practice , imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic law obstructs that process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the norms of international law and the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .  
The application of the kind of measures referred to in the draft resolution introduced today by the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya not only represents an attack on the identity of the State concerned and on its political , economic and cultural elements , but also affects other sensitive areas such as the ability of the peoples suffering from those unilateral policies fully to enjoy their human rights .  
In this connection , the Commission on Human Rights itself has determined that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has a negative impact on social and humanitarian indicators in developing countries , and prevents the peoples subjected to such measures from fully enjoying their rights .  
Furthermore , pursuant to resolution 1994 / 47 of the Commission on Human Rights , the Secretary-General informed that body , in his report contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 43 , that application of unilateral coercive measures is incompatible with the principle of international cooperation , has an adverse impact on the economies of developing countries suffering under the measures and constitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the individuals , groups and peoples affected .  
The worsening of the external , bilateral and multilateral debt crisis of developing countries ; the erosion and unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings ; restrictions on access to markets ; the lack of fairness in international trade ; one-sided views which affect cooperation ; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-making process : all these highlight in different ways the various obstacles which remain on the path to development .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
In the present instance , Cuba is requesting reopening of the item entitled " United Nations Decade of International Law " , in particular the consideration of respect for international law and its progressive development and codification , which today are under threat from unilateral interpretations by a super-Power which is seeking to impose its bilateral policy interest not only on the political action of the Organization but also on the legal thinking of the sovereign States Members of the international community .

Indeed , the alternative to the " cumbersome procedure " proposed in the Seventh report is represented either by unilateral and possibly arbitrary action by single , allegedly injured , States or groups thereof , or by merely political decisions by a political body and the action it may authorize .  
The Commission should realize that the necessity of strengthening those defences within the context of a project codifying for the first time the unwritten law of unilateral enforcement of international obligations , offers a most appropriate - and , in a sense , unique - opportunity to take a few valuable steps forward in the international law of dispute settlement , the development of which is characterized by an abundance of lip service which is inversely proportional to the number of really effective , " hard law " obligations assumed by States .  
The members of the Council urge you to fulfil your recent unilateral commitment to quarter 50,000 troops at the latest by 15 June 1996 and to increase significantly the number of workable weapons and other military equipment turned over by UNITA troops to UNAVEM III . The members of the Security Council are also concerned that the military talks on the modalities for the integration of UNITA troops into the Angolan armed forces were not concluded on 15 May 1996 in accordance with the timetable agreed by all parties on the Joint Commission earlier this month . 
The Ministers reiterated their call to the Iranian Government to end its occupation of the islands , to desist from pursuing a policy of imposing faits accomplis by force , to halt the adoption of unilateral measures , to remove the effects of any unilateral measures taken or any installations built , to adopt peaceful means of resolving the ongoing dispute in accordance with the principles and norms of international law , and to agree to the referral of the issue to the International Court of Justice .  
By its resolutions 44 / 215 , 46 / 210 , 48 / 168 and 50 / 96 , the General Assembly urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .  
I would recall that the Iraqi Government has stated on numerous occasions that the imposition of such zones is a unilateral act that should be considered to be an ongoing act of armed aggression directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and contravenes the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law .  
I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention also to the question of the two no-flight zones which the United States of America and the United Kingdom have imposed on Iraq and which the Iraqi Government has on numerous occasions said are the result of a unilateral act based on the continued use of armed force for the purpose of attacking Iraq 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
At the eleventh summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , the heads of State or Government " called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to the principle of neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage " .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
However , despite commitments made , barriers remained because the developed countries were still tempted by protectionism , as shown by anti-dumping measures , countervailing duties , progressive increases in duties , slow liberalization of the agricultural and textile sectors and the recourse to unilateral measures outside the WTO dispute settlement system , which was crucial for the defence of the developing countries ' trade interests .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment and its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Referring to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir , he said that India , despite having accepted the decision of the Security Council that a free and impartial plebiscite should be held to determine the legal status of that region , had resorted to unilateral measures to occupy the territory and had prevented the Kashmiris from exercising their right to self-determination as recognized in Security Council resolutions which were still valid and binding on all the parties : India , Pakistan and the United Nations .  
Turning to the subject of the Commission 's long-term programme of work , she said that her delegation attached most importance to the items relating to unilateral acts of States , criteria for the recognition of States , Governments and territorial acquisitions , the law of the environment and the law of the sea , the last-mentioned being an area in which Portugal had shown a strong interest .  Her delegation welcomed the proposal to carry out a preliminary study on the ownership and protection of wrecks beyond the limits of national maritime jurisdiction .  
This form of action has been of special importance in view of the precarious social and economic situation , which has been compounded by the impact on the country of mandatory sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the unilateral economic blockade from the south . 
Urges all States to refrain from adopting or implementing any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those of a coercive nature with all their negative extraterritorial effects , which create obstacles to trade relations among States , thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [ 6 ] and other international human rights instruments , in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development ;

Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Intervention , which in the Court 's view was illegal when it utilized coercive means , could take less blatant forms than the use of armed force , such as unilateral recourse to economic sanctions - a less dramatic but much more effective means , especially in relations between States of unequal power .  
the three topics mentioned in paragraph 249 of the Commission 's report - diplomatic protection ; ownership of wrecks ; and unilateral acts of States - should be topics of study , although he did not agree with the views outlined in note 9 of addendum 2 of the annexes , since the jurisdiction of the coastal State beyond its territorial sea and contiguous zone was guaranteed by the residual competence granted to it under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
And only a few days ago the Assembly extensively considered the question of Palestine and expressed its views in no uncertain terms on the Government of Israel 's continued evasion of the commitments and agreements reached as well as its blatant unilateral measures to impose a fait accompli in the occupied Palestinian territory .

The proclamation of a unilateral declaration of independence and the creation of the Bougainville Interim Government followed ; the situation has not yet returned to normal and , even though the naval blockade has been lifted , the population in some areas continues to be deprived of basic requirements and many allegations of serious violations of human rights continue to be reported . 
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences , and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,

Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,

Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
The main objective of the study should , in its view , be to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant to particular types or categories of such acts . 
The Working Group took the view that consideration by the Commission of unilateral acts by States , with a view to initiating work on the codification and progressive development of the applicable legal rules , is advisable and feasible , bearing in mind , inter alia , the following reasons : _ In their conduct in the international sphere , States frequently carry out unilateral acts with the intent to produce legal effects . 
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable in conformity with international law .  
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
We undertake to continue to coordinate our positions on these issues in regional and international forums and to contribute to the work of the United Nations Decade of International Law with the goal of intensifying the analysis of the question of the unilateral and extraterritorial application of national laws , strengthening multilateralism through the application of the international agreements signed by States and guiding the external conduct of our countries on the basis of international law .  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
If any attempt were made to make a list of such elements , however , it would have to include many others that affect international peace and security and relations of respect and cooperation between States , such as the implementation of unilateral measures of political , economic and financial coercion and the arbitrary and indefinite imposition of Security Council sanctions that do not take humanitarian limitations into account .  
Such an approach could be general or specific ; global or regional ; unilateral , bilateral or multilateral ; separate or interconnected ; step-by-step or all-encompassing , depending on the circumstances .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
The Government considered that the use of force , foreign occupation or domination , and unilateral economic coercion or international sanctions to resolve conflicts , halt violations of human rights and promote democracy , were factors in creating refugees and mass exoduses .  
The Workshop calls upon States to refrain from any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in international human rights instruments , in particular the rights of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their health and well _ being , including food and medical care , housing and the necessary social services .  
Fourthly , unilateral internalization at the producer 's level could be beneficial especially in the long run , but short-term costs and the uncertainty about foreign exchange earnings , global commodity demand , and socio-economic implications are formidable constraints58 as they have been in the removal of trade barriers . 59 Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore likely to be important to encourage internalization at the producers level and facilitate the reflection of these producer prices in international commodity prices and / or provide finance for environmentally sound processing methods . 
The underlying reason for submitting the draft resolution was the fact that the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in an increasing number of developing countries had reached alarming proportions and had had adverse economic , social and cultural effects .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all Member States and seek their views and information on the implications and negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their populations , and to submit accordingly a report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session ; 8 .  Decides to examine this question , on a priority basis , at its fifty-third session under the sub-item entitled " Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " .  
It also was necessary to exclude international juridical events , such as various notifications which did not entail an intention on the part of the author to become bound thereby , including fairly common situations in which internal juridical acts became , at the international level , simple juridical events .  69 .  Whatever the final scope of the topic turned out to be , his delegation would follow with particular interest the Commissions work on the regime of unilateral acts , particularly the question of their revocability .  
These measures have included reliance on indirect taxes , reliance on declarations and withholding of taxes by third parties , the operation of an efficient system and cross-checking of information , auditing and the unilateral determination of taxable income , the bilateral determination of taxable income ( forfeit method ) and the use of legislative provision administrative rulings and judicial decisions , as well as the enactment and enforcement of penalties .  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable to other States and are permitted by international law .  
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .

The aforementioned Act , which seeks forcibly to stifle the Cuban social and economic system through the application of punitive measures against sovereign countries that have decided to maintain economic relations with Cuba , was adopted despite the outright rejection with which it was greeted by the international community from its inception as a bill , and particularly by the North American allies , owing to its extraterritorial and unilateral nature and the fact that it infringes the sovereignty of States and violates the principles of international law . 
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 51 / 22 , entitled Elimination of coercive economic measures as a means of political and economic compulsion , is a timely initiative which aims to address thoroughly the issues of unilateral and extraterritorial measures in a comprehensive and objective fashion .  
The exercise of power through the application of illegal means such as unilateral actions and the imposition of coercive economic measures against other countries in order to achieve unjustifiable objectives is the prominent example of an emerging unilateralism that is extremely arrogant and self-centred , that feeds on hegemony and expansionism and that entails serious interference in the internal affairs of other countries to the point of sabotage and subversion .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .  
The Government of Belarus has never employed economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion and does not recognize the validity of any coercive measures or legislative acts of an extraterritorial nature that are imposed by any State on a unilateral basis .  
The Government of Cuba stated that unilateral coercive measures were punitive actions used by certain States , by virtue of their predominant position in the world economy , to impose their political will by force and to subvert the political , economic and social system of other States . 
In the opinion of the Government of Cuba , unilateral coercive measures are also blatantly interventionist and discriminatory and are applied through a wide range of economic instruments , basically related to trade , financial , technological or investment restrictions , which in any of their variants are designed to cause a critical economic situation that will force the State concerned to change the policy or policies objected to by the State applying the measures .  
The Government of Mexico will continue to express its absolute rejection of all unilateral coercive economic measures that are not authorized by the relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations .  
On the contrary , the Congress of the Republic of Venezuela has expressed in numerous statements its categorical repudiation of unilateral coercive acts that adversely affect the economies of developing countries , on the ground that such acts contravene the basic principles of coexistence and international economic cooperation and the world consensus regarding the need for a non-discriminatory and open trading system .  
Although such measures may be imposed not only by individual States , but also by a group of States , the determination or judgement of alleged wrongful or objectionable policies of target States subject to coercive economic measures is made by sender State ( s ) largely on a unilateral or narrow-group basis .  
While some of those issues are regulated by international instruments , and some of those claims may be justified , the imposition of coercive economic measures is largely based on unilateral judgements by the sender State and may disguise the intent to advance its own interests ( e.g . , protectionism ) at the expense of others .  
In illustration of a " top-down " method for estimating the impact of coercive economic measures , the expert group referred itself to a recent study that attempts to empirically measure the impact of sanctions on bilateral trade flows , particularly on exports by the United States which is the most frequent sender of unilateral sanctions . 36 But the method used , a common one in economics known as the " gravity model " , also captures the impact on the trade of the target country . 
The importance of international cooperation , including multilateral and bilateral negotiations on contentious issues , and of positive economic measures that involve adequate incentives and reward systems to induce policy changes , when warranted , was reaffirmed and stressed at the meeting as a more rational and viable alternative to unilateral coercive economic measures in most cases .  
More flexible provisions could also provide a legal base for unilateral trade preferences offered by developed countries to regional sub-groups of developing countries , such as special preferences of that kind in favour of sub-Saharan African economies .  
Although the need to strengthen international economic cooperation based on the principles of international law and recognized norms had been reiterated in most intergovernmental fora , there was increasing recourse to unilateral coercive economic measures and the enactment of domestic laws with extraterritorial effects .  
A view was also expressed that a major difficulty lay in the virtual impossibility of distinguishing between unilateral acts aimed at creating a normative legal obligation and those which were purely political in nature .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
By a letter dated 24 March 1999 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1999 / 320 ) , the representative of the Russian Federation requested that an urgent meeting of the Security Council be convened to consider " an extremely dangerous situation caused by the unilateral military action of NATO against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia " . 
Since an international organization , represented by its highest-ranking administrative officer , can in most cases conclude treaties with one or more States or with another international organization , it must be assumed that such an organization , represented by such an officer , can , in accordance with its internal rules , formulate unilateral legal acts which would no doubt be considered to belong to the category of acts that the Commission is now studying .  
Invites all Special Rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
This clarification has been made particularly urgent since the international community has been recently exposed to repeated Palestinian arguments claiming that the transitional period will end on 4 May and hence a legal and political vacuum will ensue that should be filled by a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state . 
Invites all Special Rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , as a Member State of the United Nations , calls on the Security Council of the United Nations to condemn the illegitimate decisions of the European Union on coercive economic measures against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , proclaim them null and void and demand that , in accordance with international legal norms , the unilateral illegal activities taken by the countries of the European Union against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be ceased immediately .  
A unilateral act formulated by a person who can not be considered under article 7 as authorized to represent a State for that purpose and to engage it at the international level is without legal effect unless expressly confirmed by that State .  
A unilateral act is also void if it is contrary to a States own previous norms or to a peremptory or jus cogens norm , the latter being understood as a norm accepted and recognized by the international community , as stated in the 1969 Convention .  
A unilateral statement formulated by a State or an international organization when signing , ratifying , formally confirming , accepting , approving or acceding to a treaty , or by a State when making a notification of succession to a treaty , whereby the State or international organization subordinates its consent to be bound by the treaty to a specific interpretation of the treaty or of certain provisions thereof , shall constitute a conditional interpretative declaration .  
A unilateral statement formulated by a State or an international organization when signing , ratifying , formally confirming , accepting , approving or acceding to a treaty , or by a State when making a notification of succession to a treaty , whereby the State or international organization subjects its consent to be bound by the treaty to a specific interpretation of the treaty or of certain provisions thereof , shall constitute a conditional interpretative declaration .  
A unilateral statement , however phrased or named , formulated by a State or an international organization after initialling or signature but prior to entry into force of a bilateral treaty , by which that State or that organization purports to obtain from the other party a modification of the provisions of the treaty to which it is subordinating the expression of its final consent to be bound , does not constitute a reservation within the meaning of the present Guide to practice .  
Rather , its task was ( a ) to agree on the basic elements of a workable definition of unilateral acts as a starting point for further work on the topic as well as for gathering relevant State practice , ( b ) to set the general guidelines according to which the practice of States should be gathered and ( c ) to point the direction that the work of the Special Rapporteur should take in the future .  
If that were so , there would be no need to regulate the functioning of unilateral acts , which were to be understood as autonomous or independent acts with their own distinctive characteristics and were to be distinguished from unilateral acts which fell within the scope of treaties and for which specific operational rules could be formulated .  
However , even the view that considered unilateral acts conflicting with any norm of general international law as invalid , maintained that unilateral acts designed to bring about a change in existing international law - President Trumans declaration on the continental shelf in 1946 being one example - represented a separate problem that the Special Rapporteur ought perhaps to consider .  
Rather , its task was ( a ) to agree on the basic elements of a workable definition of unilateral acts as a starting point for further work on the topic as well as for gathering relevant State practice , ( b ) to set the general guidelines according to which the practice of States should be gathered and ( c ) to point the direction that the work of the Special Rapporteur should take in the future .  
It was agreed to exclude from the study unilateral acts subject to special legal regimes such as , inter alia , those based on conventional law , reservations to treaties and declarations accepting the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice .  
At its twenty-fifth session , the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers also rejected any arbitrary or unilateral measures , whether political or legal , applied by one country against another one and urged all States to consider this law , which is against the international law and norms , as null and void ( A / 53 / 95-S / 1998 / 311 , para .  69 ) .  
Venezuela believes that unilateral measures that are extraterritorial and coercive in nature , such as the embargo imposed against Cuba , have a negative effect on the legal regime which defines economic and trade relations between nations and an adverse impact on the efforts that have been carried out in order to achieve economic integration at both the continental and subregional levels .  
Misalignments of exchange rates and trade imbalances owing to domestic economic policies that were introduced without concern for their impact on the global economy are generally acknowledged to be a major source of protectionist pressures which manifest themselves both in unilateral national measures and in tensions threatening the rules of the multilateral trade regime .  
We have heard a comprehensive report on the evolution of the United Nations role in decolonization ; we have received prescriptions for addressing this critical issue for our small island Territories in a new millennium ; and we have listened intently to the extensive dialogue on the impact of unilateral changes on the offshore financial sector of the Territories . 
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Recent calls for such reform were born of a political desire to protect human rights in the context of international consensus , rather than through the unilateral imposition of a single cultural model .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this question by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Bearing in mind all the extraterritorial effects of any unilateral legislative , administrative and economic measures , policies and practices of a coercive nature against the development process and the enhancement of human rights in developing countries , which create obstacles to the full realization of all human rights ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
The economic sanctions that the Security Council imposes on a number of countries , usually developing countries , and unilateral coercive measures are significant factors that halt the realization of the right to development , cause material and human losses in the development process and require many years to offset , particularly if such economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council continue for a long and indefinite period of time .  
The task of the Working Group was ( a ) to agree on the basic elements of a workable definition of unilateral acts as a starting point for further work on the topic as well as for gathering relevant State practice , ( b ) to set the general guidelines according to which the practice of States should be gathered , and ( c ) to point the direction that the work of the Special Rapporteur should take in the future .  
It was to be hoped that the questionnaire would meet with the widest possible response , but Governments might find it difficult to provide all the information requested , as the concept of a unilateral act might be as undefined at the national level as it was at the international level .  
Those measures unquestionably prove that those States not only imposed unilateral sanctions on Iraq in advance of those decided upon by the Security Council of the United Nations but also laid down regulations for the sanctions imposed by the Security Council , as a result of which the application of the sanctions became an ongoing institutionalized process that clearly showed that those States intended to perpetuate the embargo .  
The Russian Federation has repeatedly stated in a number of international forums that it rejects the growing trend towards unilateral extraterritorial application of national laws and measures affecting other States ' trade and foreign relations , since these laws and measures breach international law , violate the principles of the sovereign equality of States and respect for national sovereignty , and undermine peaceful coexistence .  
It emphasized the importance of international cooperation to combat impunity , bearing in mind the basic principles laid down in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations , underlined the unacceptability of unilateral State action to apply justice extraterritorially , and contended that the right of humanitarian intervention was a dubious effort to confer doctrinal legitimacy on what was really an attempt at geo-political domination .  
It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Indeed , numerous unilateral acts , whatever their content , could be classified as political , while certain unilateral acts not originally intended to have legal effects at the international level could have such effects .  
Rather , it rests with the selfish and unilateral policies of the controlling Powers , whose interests can not be served by using the United Nations mechanisms established for the correct application of the principles and rules of the Charter , which reflect the joint will and collective interests of the members of the international community . 
In fact , the challenges of recent years have led the international community to provide pragmatic answers to many of the questions posed by the Secretary-General , not only by the regular actions of humanitarian agencies and the coordinating work of the United Nations , but also , in certain cases , by specific decisions of the Security Council and even by unilateral actions .  
The report ( A 54-259 ) of the Secretary-General shows , as have his previous reports on the subject , the destructive results of the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba as a coercive and unilateral measure .  
They are unilateral attempts to change the legal , historical and demographic composition of the occupied territories and are aimed at imposing a fait accompli on the ground prior to the final status negotiations to determine the fate of the Palestinian people and its attempt to establish its independent State on its national soil , as other peoples of the world have done .  
While it acknowledged the independence of the mandates of individual organizations , the Republic of Belarus , on the basis of Article 53 of the Charter of the United Nations , considered inadmissible any unilateral enforcement action carried out by regional arrangements , especially in the military sphere , without the relevant authorization of , or circumventing , the Security Council .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Some unilateral coercive measures applied against Iran , as well as their adverse economic and social effects on the Iranian people , are reflected in the report ( A 53-293 ) submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the General Assembly under the agenda item entitled ' Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms ' .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences , and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
It is instructive to conclude from it that the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba is a unilateral action , whose extraterritorial effects have no validity in public international law .  
The quest for a unilateral security advantage for a few or the assertion of the right to an exclusive standard of national security is contrary to the spirit of a durable and sustainable system of international security in todays world .  
Despite the considerable impact of unilateral acts of States on the development of customary international law , State practice was not uniform , and it provided only a limited number of cases in which a unilateral act had been recognized as binding .  
Again calls upon all States not to recognize or apply unilateral extraterritorial coercive economic measures imposed by any State , which are contrary to recognized principles of international law ;  
Again calls upon all States not to recognize or apply unilateral extraterritorial coercive economic measures imposed by any State , which are contrary to recognized principles of international law ;  
As one member of the Commission had stated , paragraph 2 in its current form was too broad and left the door open for any junior official to formulate a unilateral act that would more than likely be invalidated subsequently .  
Among the facts which the report fails to mention are the initial study of ideas on a cease-fire and termination of hostilities designed to provide a climate more favourable to the building of peace ; the agreement on human rights and international humanitarian law in the zone proposed for peace talks with the ELN ; and the ELNs unilateral and unconditional return of individuals whom it was holding .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Underlines that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and , in this regard , calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws which run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries , as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Right to Development in its report ( E / CN . 4 / 1998 / 29 ) ;  
Invites all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
The promise of deep , progressive and irreversible reductions inherent in unilateral and bilateral efforts remains to be fully implemented and may even be threatened by the unravelling of solemn agreements and treaties which served valuable stabilizing roles .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,

Invites all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
All the acts mentioned , in the context which concerns us , are formulated [ 62 ] through unilateral declarations , whether of individual or collective origin , and these declarations are subject to definite forms as far as their conditions of validity are concerned ; the rules apply to all of them regardless of their content or material classification .  
During the discussion held in the Commission in 2000 , it was concluded that common rules could be elaborated relating to certain issues concerning unilateral acts , but not relating to all aspects , which led to the earlier exercise on the classification of unilateral acts on which the draft articles to be prepared by the Commission on this subject would be based .  
In order to address the question of interpretation and the applicable rules , a distinction must first be drawn between conventional acts and unilateral acts , from both the formal and material points of view , [ 104 ] since this will enable us to consider whether the Vienna rules can be transposed to the regime of unilateral acts , or give proper consideration to these rules , based on a flexible parallel approach .  
This happened in the case of Venezuela and Mexico , which appear to have developed a subsequent practice , the examination of which could help specify or clarify the content and scope of the unilateral commitment assumed by those countries in relation to the Central American countries through a joint communiqu which could be considered a unilateral act of collective origin . 
These two countries are using armed force on a daily basis against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in the two no-flight zones that they imposed by their unilateral decision , and these two countries are supporting , funding and training terrorist groups for the purpose of undermining Iraqs security and threatening its territorial integrity . 
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
Such confidence and security-building measures can be pursued at various levels , bilateral , subregional , regional and multilateral even unilateral measures are conceivable and can be applied flexibly to conform to the political and security characteristics and requirements of specific situations .  
A unilateral statement formulated by a State or an international organization when signing , ratifying , formally confirming , accepting , approving or acceding to a treaty , or by a State when making a notification of succession to a treaty , whereby the State or international organization subjects its consent to be bound by the treaty to a specific interpretation of the treaty or of certain provisions thereof , shall constitute a conditional interpretative declaration .  
By way of the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq , they have been continuing their military aggression against our people on a daily basis since 1991 by virtue of a unilateral and illegal decision taken by their governments in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
Those factors included : continued high dependence on food imports ; a direct linkage between rural agricultural viability and poverty reduction ; difficulties in balancing the short-term benefits of food aid and its long-term impact ; severe adjustment costs arising from unilateral liberalization of the agricultural sector ; non-competitiveness of agricultural exports in the world market ; and high dependence of foreign exchange earnings on exports of one or two agricultural commodity under preferential market access .  
As regards interpretative declarations , the Special Rapporteur indicated that , in general , they were linked to a prior text , but was of the view that in cases where the declarations went beyond the obligations contained in the treaty , the declarations would become independent acts whereby a State could assume international commitments ; these interpretative declarations would thus be included among the unilateral acts falling within the scope of the topic .  
Some members reiterated the importance of the topic and expressed satisfaction with references made in the report to doctrine and judicial decisions on unilateral acts , though it was also stated that additional factual information on the cases cited would be most helpful in analysing the legal validity of unilateral acts .  
It was stated that the suggested draft articles contained some contradictory elements in that they posed intention as a primary criterion yet placed among the supplementary means of interpretation the main ways in which intention could be asserted in connection with a unilateral act , namely preparatory work and the circumstances at the time of the acts formulation .  
Given the attention being paid to international norms for products entering trade , it was an important step that development partners committed to providing assistance to least developed countries in developing infrastructure to ensure quality control and conformity to international standards of their products and to avoiding taking unilateral action in a manner inconsistent with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization .  
In the resolution , the Assembly , inter alia , urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that were not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or were inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravened the basic principles of the multilateral trading system .  
In accordance with paragraph 2 of the resolution , our country is making steady and active efforts to prevent the use , in violation of decisions made by the relevant United Nations organs , of unilateral measures of economic and political coercion inconsistent with the norms of international law and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations as a means of applying pressure on independent developing States .  
The adoption of laws encouraging the use of unilateral coercive economic measures in order to achieve political objectives constitutes a flagrant violation of the rules of international law , particularly the principles , objectives and rules governing trade among nations .  
Beyond the escalation represented by the legislation known as the Torricelli and the Helms-Burton acts , together with the additional measures adopted towards the end of 2000 as part of the Cuba blockade policy , the fact that a new Administration with recognized ties to the Miami terrorist groups has taken office has only increased the danger that the unilateral measures and the brutal war directed against the Cuban people will be intensified .  
The international community can not remain indifferent to the risk posed by the proliferation of unilateral coercive economic measures , especially extraterritorial ones , and it must therefore move quickly to take suitable action to put an end to such practices .  
The United Nations and other organizations , whether of an international or regional character , have adopted an enormous number of resolutions condemning the use of unilateral coercive economic measures because of the great damage they do to the economies of the developing countries and their negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a just and non-discriminatory trading system .  
The Commission on Human Rights itself has stated that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has an adverse effect on the social and humanitarian situation of developing countries .  
For this reason , the Government of the Republic of Mali believes that the international community should adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and are contrary to the basic principles of the international trading system .  
In the light of these considerations and the purport of General Assembly resolution 54 / 200 , in particular paragraph 2 thereof , it is incumbent on the members of the international community to abide by the principle that unilateral coercive economic and political measures against States contravene the principles of the multilateral trading system .  
We believe that , apart from unilateral and bilateral steps in the area of nuclear disarmament , the time has come to start discussions on strategic issues within the framework of multilateral mechanisms , including among the five permanent members of the Security Council , who bear special responsibility for the fate of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , the CTBT and other international agreements .  
Within the framework of the trade liberalization that was advocated so much at the current time , there was a proliferation of coercive unilateral economic measures dictated by the developed countries with regard to developing countries for purely political purposes .  
In carrying out his mandate , the independent expert must respect a set of basic principles to be embodied in the resolution requesting his appointment , including international cooperation based on Article 2 of the United Nations Charter , the condemnation of unilateral actions , respect for the key role of States in action to combat impunity and the obligation to determine the responsibility of the perpetrators of human rights violations as an essential component of effective compensation and international cooperation through universally applicable mechanisms . 
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
In the light of the foregoing , we call upon you to intervene on the basis of the facts set forth above and to urge Kuwait to halt its unilateral exploitation of the shared transboundary oilfields , which causes the constant migration of our oil resources , and to reach agreement with Iraq on the manner in which these fields can be exploited so as to safeguard the rights of both parties .  
It follows from draft guideline 1.2.1 that , like a reservation , a conditional interpretative declaration is A unilateral statement formulated by a State or an international organization when signing , ratifying , formally confirming , accepting , approving or acceding to a treaty , or by a State when making a notification of succession to a treaty . 21 Any conditional interpretative declaration not made at any of these times is therefore late and can be envisaged only if all the contracting parties consent , at least tacitly , to do so . 
Such a practice is a covert unilateral nuclear arms expansion in essence , which not only is unfavorable to the safeguarding of the global strategic balance and stability , but will also shake the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear nonproliferation .  
The move in fact represents unilateral nuclear arms build-up in disguised form .  The move will not only bring severe damage to the integrity and vitality of the ABM treaty and the global strategic balance and stability , but will also seriously disrupt the basis for the US-Russia bilateralnuclear reductions , impede the international nuclear disarmament process , thus shatter the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear non-proliferation .  
Even more serious , the " ABM Treaty " is built on the basis of the theory of relative security ; it brought about relative balance of US and Soviet nuclear offensive and defensive forces through " mutually assured destruction " and prevented either side from carrying out a preemptive nuclear strike , while the US NMD is aimed at achieving its unilateral absolute military superiority and absolute security .  
It is worth pondering that after this multinational joint exercise , this naval task fleet of India did not leave the region , but on the contrary continued to stay there .  Moreover , it was joined by one more " Kilo " class submarine and several antisubmarine patrol aircrafts to continue their unilateral naval exercise .  
Adapting itself to the trend of the times and the actual situation in its own region , it has developed a unique APEC mode , which recognizes diversification , allows flexibility , upholds the principle of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , consensus through consultation , seeking common grounds while reserving differences , and independent and voluntary participation , and integrate unilateral and collective actions on trade and investment liberalization . 
He said : Russia and the United States are shouldering the special responsibility of safeguarding world peace and stability and building a new international security framework .  All this needs efforts to conduct close bilateral cooperation and international cooperation .  Any unilateral action may make solutions for modern social problems difficult .  
Because the " Red Army " and the " Blue Army " compete with each other without knowing the other side 's manpower deployment , battle approaches , and tactical motives , their tactical training has therefore altered from a unilateral combined training to a realistic actual-troops confrontation , thus changing the mode of our military 's exercise , in which the " Red Army " used to win every battle .  
He said : By adopting a foreign policy of going our own way , the Bush Administration will disrupt international security , hurt our economic and environmental protection interests , and stop a historical chance for us to agree with China and Russia on limiting weapons and reducing nuclear weapons .  " These examples demonstrate that a country 's unilateral actions can not possibly form a lasting strategic framework that has the submission of all other countries . "  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
The proposed three mini links between the two shores represents a decisionmaking mode most representative of characteristics of the new government .  The MAC deems it possible to attain such a " goal " as forging " links " between the two shores through its unilateral , one-sided , and subjective move and without holding negotiations or consultations or even signing an agreement with the other shore .  Obviously , it has treated the other shore as a non-existent " suppositional adversary . "  This unique way of " creating links " is indeed rare in the world .  
By listing themselves overseas , China 's enterprises are not only able to raise funds for faster development , but also make use the listing to change the original unilateral capital structure of sole government ownership .  With the change of capital structure , it is able to develop enterprises under the mixed form of ownership with the participation of foreign investment , establish a corporate legal person management structure with diversified investments , and further build a modern enterprise system .  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
The same representative stressed the importance of emphasizing the repercussions on women of unilateral economic measures of a coercive nature which are , at times , applied against developing countries for political reasons .  
Future work on trade and environment must be aimed at developing an agreed framework for the use of necessary legitimate , transparent and predictable measures for environmental objectives while preventing unilateral and arbitrary green protectionism .  
At the intergovernmental level , it had become widely recognized that the drug problem could not be tackled on a unilateral or even a bilateral basis but , being global in nature , would require extended and improved international cooperation .  
On the contrary , in a wide range of forums we have rejected unilateral coercive measure that affect the well-being of peoples , hamper free trade , and are alien to universally recognized commercial practices .  
The Heads of State or Government called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba , which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the United Nations Charter , international law and the principle of good neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage .  
In accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , as well as those of the World Trade Organization and of international law , and also in accordance with resolutions of the General Assembly , we reject the unilateral coercive measures that affect the well-being of Ibero-America peoples , impede free exchange and universally accepted transparent trade practices and violate the principles governing regional coexistence and the sovereignty of States .  
Any discriminatory trading practice , any imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic laws hampers this process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the standards of international law and the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations .  
The arrogant approach and attitude of the Government of the United States of America towards the international community , and the unsuccessful attempts of the American foreign policy establishment to exploit issues of global concern , such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , to advance an extraneous and illegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed dangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral measures .  
In addition , at a time when the North-South gap continues to widen on a daily basis , the world economic trend , manipulated by unilateral actions and protectionist policies on the part of the developed countries , also tends further to debilitate the potential of the developing countries to deal with the adverse impacts of international economic development .  
For our part , in addition to supporting the Assembly resolutions on the subject , we have declared a unilateral moratorium on mine production , and with regard to a case which affects us directly the mines planted by our armed forces on the Malvinas Islands in 1982 we have offered our cooperation and financial help to the United Kingdom for their removal , which is proceeding with the greatly appreciated cooperation of the United States .  
In concrete terms , that means concluding quickly the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( CTBT ) ; it means an energetic effort to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes ; and it means an effort to transform unilateral declarations on negative security assurances into legally binding treaty obligations . 
Depending upon circumstances , it should be comprehensive or specific , global or regional , unilateral , bilateral or multilateral , separate or interconnected , step-by-step but part of a grand strategy always mutually complementary pieces of one mosaic .  
Those Governments that are thus accused of failure to live up to international humanitarian standards are subjected to unilateral arms embargoes imposed on them by the arms - exporting countries , whereas the perpetrators of violence who procure their weapons , perhaps from the very same sources , are never held accountable for their illegal and destabilizing activities .  
They stressed that the existing assurances and unilateral declarations fell far short of the credible assurances sought by non-nuclear-weapon States and that , in order to be effective , the assurances should be unconditional , without qualification , not subject to divergent interpretation and unlimited in scope , application and duration . 
The Working Group recognized that joint studies on some form of international cooperation , keeping in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , could help overcome concerns about international competitiveness as a result of unilateral implementation of domestic policy reforms aimed at promoting sustainable development .  
Several delegations stressed the need to ensure adequate resources for strengthening activities under programme 12 pertaining to the continuing economic and social transformation in countries with economies in transition and the reporting to the General Assembly and to the Security Council on the implementation of multilateral economic sanctions on the effects of unilateral economic coercive measures .  
The use of unilateral coercive economic measures as a means of exercising political and economic pressure against developing countries constitutes a grave violation of the human rights of individuals , groups and people recognized in the Charter of the United Nations and in all international human rights instruments . 
The stated policy objectives in specific cases of coercive economic measures reflect a broad range of options based on unilateral judgements by the sender State , and express specific interests .  
The promulgation by the United States of America of laws and regulations imposing an unjust embargo on the Cuban people constitutes a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations since it has the purpose of achieving unilateral political objectives that bear no relation to international peace and security .  This embargo is , moreover , incompatible with the most elementary humanitarian and moral standards .  
The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania has consistently rejected any unilateral promulgation and application of laws such as those referred to in resolution 49 / 9 because such measures are inconsistent with the general principles of international law and violate the provisions of Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular paragraph 2 on developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
It was a matter of concern that some developed countries continued to impose unilateral protectionist measures and to create new types of protectionism , such as environmental labelling and social clauses , that would have an adverse impact on economic growth and development in the developing countries . 
is evident that the continuation of this kind of irresponsible unilateral conduct and arrogant behaviour by the United States Government will set an alarming precedent with far-reaching adverse implications for international peace and security and create uncertainty and insecurity in international relations , for which the United States alone must bear full responsibility .  
With regard to the matter of the extraterritoriality of national laws , a most sensitive issue for peoples and Governments the world over , the Rio Group summit meeting expressed its rejection of any attempt to use a country 's domestic legislation to impose unilateral sanctions of an extraterritorial character , as this contravenes the standards governing coexistence between States , disregards the fundamental principle of respect for sovereignty and is a clear violation of international law .  
In this setting , on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , we observed and took part in a series of momentous statements on the universal nature of this Organization , as well as the formulation of solemn commitments to the principles and purposes that have guided and should continue to guide the future work of the United Nations . However , predictably , during the past year the purposes and principles that have guided us for over 50 years have once again undergone unilateral interpretation . 
The United Nations will not be strong and effective if it allows cardinal principles of international law , such as respect for sovereignty , the territorial integrity of States and the right of States freely to choose their political , economic and social system , to succumb to unilateral political interests and the imposition of models .  
While that communiqu , among other things , calls for strengthening economic and monetary cooperation and for the provision of necessary multilateral support for development , it is astonishing to witness how one of the members of that group , in total disregard of those stated purposes , which are relevant issues to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit , and in pursuance of its own short-sighted and politically motivated interests , vehemently imposes unilateral coercive measures through the adoption of legislation with extraterritorial effects against other countries .  
The evident behavioural characteristics of this menace , disguised behind appealing facades , can be summarized in the following manner : first , there is unilateralism , which means a total lack of commitment to mutual cooperation and common solutions , and complete reliance on unilateral measures in various fields .  
Recent unilateral sanctions enacted by the United States against the trading partners of a number of countries not only constitute a grave breach of various norms and principles of international law and many resolutions of this Assembly and other international forums as well as blatant interference in the internal and external affairs of other States , but , indeed , point to a very dangerous trend , which undermines the very foundations of contemporary inter-State relations .  
In the same negotiations , insistence on unilateral , non-transparent national technical means as opposed to a multilateral and transparent international monitoring system created a major obstacle for consensus .  
The application of unilateral measures that ignore the growing negative opinion of the international community can not constitute a solid foundation for a peaceful and secure coexistence , ruled by law .  
The efforts of developing countries in carrying out trade and macroeconomic reforms aimed at sustained economic growth can be impeded by the use of unilateral actions by major economies , in particular those with extraterritorial effects .  
Any discriminatory trade practice , imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic law obstructs that process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the norms of international law and the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .  
The application of the kind of measures referred to in the draft resolution introduced today by the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya not only represents an attack on the identity of the State concerned and on its political , economic and cultural elements , but also affects other sensitive areas such as the ability of the peoples suffering from those unilateral policies fully to enjoy their human rights .  
In this connection , the Commission on Human Rights itself has determined that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has a negative impact on social and humanitarian indicators in developing countries , and prevents the peoples subjected to such measures from fully enjoying their rights .  
Furthermore , pursuant to resolution 1994 / 47 of the Commission on Human Rights , the Secretary-General informed that body , in his report contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 43 , that application of unilateral coercive measures is incompatible with the principle of international cooperation , has an adverse impact on the economies of developing countries suffering under the measures and constitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the individuals , groups and peoples affected .  
The worsening of the external , bilateral and multilateral debt crisis of developing countries ; the erosion and unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings ; restrictions on access to markets ; the lack of fairness in international trade ; one-sided views which affect cooperation ; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-making process : all these highlight in different ways the various obstacles which remain on the path to development .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
In the present instance , Cuba is requesting reopening of the item entitled " United Nations Decade of International Law " , in particular the consideration of respect for international law and its progressive development and codification , which today are under threat from unilateral interpretations by a super-Power which is seeking to impose its bilateral policy interest not only on the political action of the Organization but also on the legal thinking of the sovereign States Members of the international community .

Indeed , the alternative to the " cumbersome procedure " proposed in the Seventh report is represented either by unilateral and possibly arbitrary action by single , allegedly injured , States or groups thereof , or by merely political decisions by a political body and the action it may authorize .  
The Commission should realize that the necessity of strengthening those defences within the context of a project codifying for the first time the unwritten law of unilateral enforcement of international obligations , offers a most appropriate - and , in a sense , unique - opportunity to take a few valuable steps forward in the international law of dispute settlement , the development of which is characterized by an abundance of lip service which is inversely proportional to the number of really effective , " hard law " obligations assumed by States .  
The members of the Council urge you to fulfil your recent unilateral commitment to quarter 50,000 troops at the latest by 15 June 1996 and to increase significantly the number of workable weapons and other military equipment turned over by UNITA troops to UNAVEM III . The members of the Security Council are also concerned that the military talks on the modalities for the integration of UNITA troops into the Angolan armed forces were not concluded on 15 May 1996 in accordance with the timetable agreed by all parties on the Joint Commission earlier this month . 
The Ministers reiterated their call to the Iranian Government to end its occupation of the islands , to desist from pursuing a policy of imposing faits accomplis by force , to halt the adoption of unilateral measures , to remove the effects of any unilateral measures taken or any installations built , to adopt peaceful means of resolving the ongoing dispute in accordance with the principles and norms of international law , and to agree to the referral of the issue to the International Court of Justice .  
By its resolutions 44 / 215 , 46 / 210 , 48 / 168 and 50 / 96 , the General Assembly urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .  
I would recall that the Iraqi Government has stated on numerous occasions that the imposition of such zones is a unilateral act that should be considered to be an ongoing act of armed aggression directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and contravenes the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law .  
I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention also to the question of the two no-flight zones which the United States of America and the United Kingdom have imposed on Iraq and which the Iraqi Government has on numerous occasions said are the result of a unilateral act based on the continued use of armed force for the purpose of attacking Iraq 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
At the eleventh summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , the heads of State or Government " called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to the principle of neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage " .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
However , despite commitments made , barriers remained because the developed countries were still tempted by protectionism , as shown by anti-dumping measures , countervailing duties , progressive increases in duties , slow liberalization of the agricultural and textile sectors and the recourse to unilateral measures outside the WTO dispute settlement system , which was crucial for the defence of the developing countries ' trade interests .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment and its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Referring to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir , he said that India , despite having accepted the decision of the Security Council that a free and impartial plebiscite should be held to determine the legal status of that region , had resorted to unilateral measures to occupy the territory and had prevented the Kashmiris from exercising their right to self-determination as recognized in Security Council resolutions which were still valid and binding on all the parties : India , Pakistan and the United Nations .  
Turning to the subject of the Commission 's long-term programme of work , she said that her delegation attached most importance to the items relating to unilateral acts of States , criteria for the recognition of States , Governments and territorial acquisitions , the law of the environment and the law of the sea , the last-mentioned being an area in which Portugal had shown a strong interest .  Her delegation welcomed the proposal to carry out a preliminary study on the ownership and protection of wrecks beyond the limits of national maritime jurisdiction .  
This form of action has been of special importance in view of the precarious social and economic situation , which has been compounded by the impact on the country of mandatory sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the unilateral economic blockade from the south . 
Urges all States to refrain from adopting or implementing any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those of a coercive nature with all their negative extraterritorial effects , which create obstacles to trade relations among States , thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [ 6 ] and other international human rights instruments , in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development ;  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Intervention , which in the Court 's view was illegal when it utilized coercive means , could take less blatant forms than the use of armed force , such as unilateral recourse to economic sanctions - a less dramatic but much more effective means , especially in relations between States of unequal power .  
the three topics mentioned in paragraph 249 of the Commission 's report - diplomatic protection ; ownership of wrecks ; and unilateral acts of States - should be topics of study , although he did not agree with the views outlined in note 9 of addendum 2 of the annexes , since the jurisdiction of the coastal State beyond its territorial sea and contiguous zone was guaranteed by the residual competence granted to it under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
And only a few days ago the Assembly extensively considered the question of Palestine and expressed its views in no uncertain terms on the Government of Israel 's continued evasion of the commitments and agreements reached as well as its blatant unilateral measures to impose a fait accompli in the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
According to ICC , the private sector 's priorities for the next phase include increasing use of multilateral arrangements to resolve transboundary environmental issues ( instead of unilateral approaches ) ; incentive-based approaches , such as joint implementation ; greater involvement of business and industry in multilateral agreements and organizations through innovative consultative mechanisms ; and a more prominent role for international environmental technical and management standards and voluntary codes , as complements to regulatory frameworks .  
The proclamation of a unilateral declaration of independence and the creation of the Bougainville Interim Government followed ; the situation has not yet returned to normal and , even though the naval blockade has been lifted , the population in some areas continues to be deprived of basic requirements and many allegations of serious violations of human rights continue to be reported . 
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences , and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,

Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
The main objective of the study should , in its view , be to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant to particular types or categories of such acts . 
The Working Group took the view that consideration by the Commission of unilateral acts by States , with a view to initiating work on the codification and progressive development of the applicable legal rules , is advisable and feasible , bearing in mind , inter alia , the following reasons : _ In their conduct in the international sphere , States frequently carry out unilateral acts with the intent to produce legal effects . 
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable in conformity with international law .  
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
We undertake to continue to coordinate our positions on these issues in regional and international forums and to contribute to the work of the United Nations Decade of International Law with the goal of intensifying the analysis of the question of the unilateral and extraterritorial application of national laws , strengthening multilateralism through the application of the international agreements signed by States and guiding the external conduct of our countries on the basis of international law .  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
If any attempt were made to make a list of such elements , however , it would have to include many others that affect international peace and security and relations of respect and cooperation between States , such as the implementation of unilateral measures of political , economic and financial coercion and the arbitrary and indefinite imposition of Security Council sanctions that do not take humanitarian limitations into account .  
Such an approach could be general or specific ; global or regional ; unilateral , bilateral or multilateral ; separate or interconnected ; step-by-step or all-encompassing , depending on the circumstances .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
The Government considered that the use of force , foreign occupation or domination , and unilateral economic coercion or international sanctions to resolve conflicts , halt violations of human rights and promote democracy , were factors in creating refugees and mass exoduses .  
The Workshop calls upon States to refrain from any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in international human rights instruments , in particular the rights of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their health and well _ being , including food and medical care , housing and the necessary social services .  
Fourthly , unilateral internalization at the producer 's level could be beneficial especially in the long run , but short-term costs and the uncertainty about foreign exchange earnings , global commodity demand , and socio-economic implications are formidable constraints58 as they have been in the removal of trade barriers . 59 Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore likely to be important to encourage internalization at the producers level and facilitate the reflection of these producer prices in international commodity prices and / or provide finance for environmentally sound processing methods . 
The underlying reason for submitting the draft resolution was the fact that the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in an increasing number of developing countries had reached alarming proportions and had had adverse economic , social and cultural effects .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all Member States and seek their views and information on the implications and negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their populations , and to submit accordingly a report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session ; 8 .  Decides to examine this question , on a priority basis , at its fifty-third session under the sub-item entitled " Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " .  
It also was necessary to exclude international juridical events , such as various notifications which did not entail an intention on the part of the author to become bound thereby , including fairly common situations in which internal juridical acts became , at the international level , simple juridical events .  69 .  Whatever the final scope of the topic turned out to be , his delegation would follow with particular interest the Commissions work on the regime of unilateral acts , particularly the question of their revocability .  
These measures have included reliance on indirect taxes , reliance on declarations and withholding of taxes by third parties , the operation of an efficient system and cross-checking of information , auditing and the unilateral determination of taxable income , the bilateral determination of taxable income ( forfeit method ) and the use of legislative provision administrative rulings and judicial decisions , as well as the enactment and enforcement of penalties .  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable to other States and are permitted by international law .  
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
In that connection , his delegation was deeply concerned that , using the pretext of freedom , democracy or the environment , laws were being promulgated and unilateral restrictions were being imposed which undermined free trade and violated international law and the trading practices negotiated at the multilateral level . 
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .  
The aforementioned Act , which seeks forcibly to stifle the Cuban social and economic system through the application of punitive measures against sovereign countries that have decided to maintain economic relations with Cuba , was adopted despite the outright rejection with which it was greeted by the international community from its inception as a bill , and particularly by the North American allies , owing to its extraterritorial and unilateral nature and the fact that it infringes the sovereignty of States and violates the principles of international law . 
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 51 / 22 , entitled Elimination of coercive economic measures as a means of political and economic compulsion , is a timely initiative which aims to address thoroughly the issues of unilateral and extraterritorial measures in a comprehensive and objective fashion .  
The exercise of power through the application of illegal means such as unilateral actions and the imposition of coercive economic measures against other countries in order to achieve unjustifiable objectives is the prominent example of an emerging unilateralism that is extremely arrogant and self-centred , that feeds on hegemony and expansionism and that entails serious interference in the internal affairs of other countries to the point of sabotage and subversion .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .  
The Government of Belarus has never employed economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion and does not recognize the validity of any coercive measures or legislative acts of an extraterritorial nature that are imposed by any State on a unilateral basis .  
The Government of Cuba stated that unilateral coercive measures were punitive actions used by certain States , by virtue of their predominant position in the world economy , to impose their political will by force and to subvert the political , economic and social system of other States . 
In the opinion of the Government of Cuba , unilateral coercive measures are also blatantly interventionist and discriminatory and are applied through a wide range of economic instruments , basically related to trade , financial , technological or investment restrictions , which in any of their variants are designed to cause a critical economic situation that will force the State concerned to change the policy or policies objected to by the State applying the measures .  
The Government of Mexico will continue to express its absolute rejection of all unilateral coercive economic measures that are not authorized by the relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations .  
On the contrary , the Congress of the Republic of Venezuela has expressed in numerous statements its categorical repudiation of unilateral coercive acts that adversely affect the economies of developing countries , on the ground that such acts contravene the basic principles of coexistence and international economic cooperation and the world consensus regarding the need for a non-discriminatory and open trading system .  
Although such measures may be imposed not only by individual States , but also by a group of States , the determination or judgement of alleged wrongful or objectionable policies of target States subject to coercive economic measures is made by sender State ( s ) largely on a unilateral or narrow-group basis .  
While some of those issues are regulated by international instruments , and some of those claims may be justified , the imposition of coercive economic measures is largely based on unilateral judgements by the sender State and may disguise the intent to advance its own interests ( e.g . , protectionism ) at the expense of others .  
In illustration of a " top-down " method for estimating the impact of coercive economic measures , the expert group referred itself to a recent study that attempts to empirically measure the impact of sanctions on bilateral trade flows , particularly on exports by the United States which is the most frequent sender of unilateral sanctions . 36 But the method used , a common one in economics known as the " gravity model " , also captures the impact on the trade of the target country . 
The importance of international cooperation , including multilateral and bilateral negotiations on contentious issues , and of positive economic measures that involve adequate incentives and reward systems to induce policy changes , when warranted , was reaffirmed and stressed at the meeting as a more rational and viable alternative to unilateral coercive economic measures in most cases .  
More flexible provisions could also provide a legal base for unilateral trade preferences offered by developed countries to regional sub-groups of developing countries , such as special preferences of that kind in favour of sub-Saharan African economies .  
Although the need to strengthen international economic cooperation based on the principles of international law and recognized norms had been reiterated in most intergovernmental fora , there was increasing recourse to unilateral coercive economic measures and the enactment of domestic laws with extraterritorial effects .  
A view was also expressed that a major difficulty lay in the virtual impossibility of distinguishing between unilateral acts aimed at creating a normative legal obligation and those which were purely political in nature .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
By a letter dated 24 March 1999 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1999 / 320 ) , the representative of the Russian Federation requested that an urgent meeting of the Security Council be convened to consider " an extremely dangerous situation caused by the unilateral military action of NATO against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia " . 
Since an international organization , represented by its highest-ranking administrative officer , can in most cases conclude treaties with one or more States or with another international organization , it must be assumed that such an organization , represented by such an officer , can , in accordance with its internal rules , formulate unilateral legal acts which would no doubt be considered to belong to the category of acts that the Commission is now studying .  
Invites all Special Rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
This clarification has been made particularly urgent since the international community has been recently exposed to repeated Palestinian arguments claiming that the transitional period will end on 4 May and hence a legal and political vacuum will ensue that should be filled by a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state . 
Invites all Special Rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , as a Member State of the United Nations , calls on the Security Council of the United Nations to condemn the illegitimate decisions of the European Union on coercive economic measures against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , proclaim them null and void and demand that , in accordance with international legal norms , the unilateral illegal activities taken by the countries of the European Union against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be ceased immediately .  
A unilateral act formulated by a person who can not be considered under article 7 as authorized to represent a State for that purpose and to engage it at the international level is without legal effect unless expressly confirmed by that State .  
A unilateral act is also void if it is contrary to a States own previous norms or to a peremptory or jus cogens norm , the latter being understood as a norm accepted and recognized by the international community , as stated in the 1969 Convention .  
A unilateral statement formulated by a State or an international organization when signing , ratifying , formally confirming , accepting , approving or acceding to a treaty , or by a State when making a notification of succession to a treaty , whereby the State or international organization subordinates its consent to be bound by the treaty to a specific interpretation of the treaty or of certain provisions thereof , shall constitute a conditional interpretative declaration .  
A unilateral statement formulated by a State or an international organization when signing , ratifying , formally confirming , accepting , approving or acceding to a treaty , or by a State when making a notification of succession to a treaty , whereby the State or international organization subjects its consent to be bound by the treaty to a specific interpretation of the treaty or of certain provisions thereof , shall constitute a conditional interpretative declaration .  
A unilateral statement , however phrased or named , formulated by a State or an international organization after initialling or signature but prior to entry into force of a bilateral treaty , by which that State or that organization purports to obtain from the other party a modification of the provisions of the treaty to which it is subordinating the expression of its final consent to be bound , does not constitute a reservation within the meaning of the present Guide to practice .  
Rather , its task was ( a ) to agree on the basic elements of a workable definition of unilateral acts as a starting point for further work on the topic as well as for gathering relevant State practice , ( b ) to set the general guidelines according to which the practice of States should be gathered and ( c ) to point the direction that the work of the Special Rapporteur should take in the future .  
If that were so , there would be no need to regulate the functioning of unilateral acts , which were to be understood as autonomous or independent acts with their own distinctive characteristics and were to be distinguished from unilateral acts which fell within the scope of treaties and for which specific operational rules could be formulated .  
However , even the view that considered unilateral acts conflicting with any norm of general international law as invalid , maintained that unilateral acts designed to bring about a change in existing international law - President Trumans declaration on the continental shelf in 1946 being one example - represented a separate problem that the Special Rapporteur ought perhaps to consider .

It was agreed to exclude from the study unilateral acts subject to special legal regimes such as , inter alia , those based on conventional law , reservations to treaties and declarations accepting the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice .  
At its twenty-fifth session , the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers also rejected any arbitrary or unilateral measures , whether political or legal , applied by one country against another one and urged all States to consider this law , which is against the international law and norms , as null and void ( A / 53 / 95-S / 1998 / 311 , para .  69 ) .  
Venezuela believes that unilateral measures that are extraterritorial and coercive in nature , such as the embargo imposed against Cuba , have a negative effect on the legal regime which defines economic and trade relations between nations and an adverse impact on the efforts that have been carried out in order to achieve economic integration at both the continental and subregional levels .  
Misalignments of exchange rates and trade imbalances owing to domestic economic policies that were introduced without concern for their impact on the global economy are generally acknowledged to be a major source of protectionist pressures which manifest themselves both in unilateral national measures and in tensions threatening the rules of the multilateral trade regime .  
We have heard a comprehensive report on the evolution of the United Nations role in decolonization ; we have received prescriptions for addressing this critical issue for our small island Territories in a new millennium ; and we have listened intently to the extensive dialogue on the impact of unilateral changes on the offshore financial sector of the Territories . 
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Recent calls for such reform were born of a political desire to protect human rights in the context of international consensus , rather than through the unilateral imposition of a single cultural model .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this question by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Bearing in mind all the extraterritorial effects of any unilateral legislative , administrative and economic measures , policies and practices of a coercive nature against the development process and the enhancement of human rights in developing countries , which create obstacles to the full realization of all human rights ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
The economic sanctions that the Security Council imposes on a number of countries , usually developing countries , and unilateral coercive measures are significant factors that halt the realization of the right to development , cause material and human losses in the development process and require many years to offset , particularly if such economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council continue for a long and indefinite period of time .  
The task of the Working Group was ( a ) to agree on the basic elements of a workable definition of unilateral acts as a starting point for further work on the topic as well as for gathering relevant State practice , ( b ) to set the general guidelines according to which the practice of States should be gathered , and ( c ) to point the direction that the work of the Special Rapporteur should take in the future .  
It was to be hoped that the questionnaire would meet with the widest possible response , but Governments might find it difficult to provide all the information requested , as the concept of a unilateral act might be as undefined at the national level as it was at the international level .  
Those measures unquestionably prove that those States not only imposed unilateral sanctions on Iraq in advance of those decided upon by the Security Council of the United Nations but also laid down regulations for the sanctions imposed by the Security Council , as a result of which the application of the sanctions became an ongoing institutionalized process that clearly showed that those States intended to perpetuate the embargo .  
The Russian Federation has repeatedly stated in a number of international forums that it rejects the growing trend towards unilateral extraterritorial application of national laws and measures affecting other States ' trade and foreign relations , since these laws and measures breach international law , violate the principles of the sovereign equality of States and respect for national sovereignty , and undermine peaceful coexistence .  
It emphasized the importance of international cooperation to combat impunity , bearing in mind the basic principles laid down in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations , underlined the unacceptability of unilateral State action to apply justice extraterritorially , and contended that the right of humanitarian intervention was a dubious effort to confer doctrinal legitimacy on what was really an attempt at geo-political domination .  
It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Indeed , numerous unilateral acts , whatever their content , could be classified as political , while certain unilateral acts not originally intended to have legal effects at the international level could have such effects .  
Rather , it rests with the selfish and unilateral policies of the controlling Powers , whose interests can not be served by using the United Nations mechanisms established for the correct application of the principles and rules of the Charter , which reflect the joint will and collective interests of the members of the international community . 
In fact , the challenges of recent years have led the international community to provide pragmatic answers to many of the questions posed by the Secretary-General , not only by the regular actions of humanitarian agencies and the coordinating work of the United Nations , but also , in certain cases , by specific decisions of the Security Council and even by unilateral actions .  
The report ( A 54-259 ) of the Secretary-General shows , as have his previous reports on the subject , the destructive results of the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba as a coercive and unilateral measure .  
They are unilateral attempts to change the legal , historical and demographic composition of the occupied territories and are aimed at imposing a fait accompli on the ground prior to the final status negotiations to determine the fate of the Palestinian people and its attempt to establish its independent State on its national soil , as other peoples of the world have done .  
While it acknowledged the independence of the mandates of individual organizations , the Republic of Belarus , on the basis of Article 53 of the Charter of the United Nations , considered inadmissible any unilateral enforcement action carried out by regional arrangements , especially in the military sphere , without the relevant authorization of , or circumventing , the Security Council .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Some unilateral coercive measures applied against Iran , as well as their adverse economic and social effects on the Iranian people , are reflected in the report ( A 53-293 ) submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the General Assembly under the agenda item entitled ' Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms ' .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences , and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
It is instructive to conclude from it that the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba is a unilateral action , whose extraterritorial effects have no validity in public international law .  
The quest for a unilateral security advantage for a few or the assertion of the right to an exclusive standard of national security is contrary to the spirit of a durable and sustainable system of international security in todays world .  
Despite the considerable impact of unilateral acts of States on the development of customary international law , State practice was not uniform , and it provided only a limited number of cases in which a unilateral act had been recognized as binding .  
Again calls upon all States not to recognize or apply unilateral extraterritorial coercive economic measures imposed by any State , which are contrary to recognized principles of international law ;  
Again calls upon all States not to recognize or apply unilateral extraterritorial coercive economic measures imposed by any State , which are contrary to recognized principles of international law ;  
As one member of the Commission had stated , paragraph 2 in its current form was too broad and left the door open for any junior official to formulate a unilateral act that would more than likely be invalidated subsequently .  
Among the facts which the report fails to mention are the initial study of ideas on a cease-fire and termination of hostilities designed to provide a climate more favourable to the building of peace ; the agreement on human rights and international humanitarian law in the zone proposed for peace talks with the ELN ; and the ELNs unilateral and unconditional return of individuals whom it was holding .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Underlines that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and , in this regard , calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws which run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries , as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Right to Development in its report ( E / CN . 4 / 1998 / 29 ) ;  
Invites all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
The promise of deep , progressive and irreversible reductions inherent in unilateral and bilateral efforts remains to be fully implemented and may even be threatened by the unravelling of solemn agreements and treaties which served valuable stabilizing roles .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,

Invites all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
All the acts mentioned , in the context which concerns us , are formulated [ 62 ] through unilateral declarations , whether of individual or collective origin , and these declarations are subject to definite forms as far as their conditions of validity are concerned ; the rules apply to all of them regardless of their content or material classification .  
During the discussion held in the Commission in 2000 , it was concluded that common rules could be elaborated relating to certain issues concerning unilateral acts , but not relating to all aspects , which led to the earlier exercise on the classification of unilateral acts on which the draft articles to be prepared by the Commission on this subject would be based .  
In order to address the question of interpretation and the applicable rules , a distinction must first be drawn between conventional acts and unilateral acts , from both the formal and material points of view , [ 104 ] since this will enable us to consider whether the Vienna rules can be transposed to the regime of unilateral acts , or give proper consideration to these rules , based on a flexible parallel approach .  
This happened in the case of Venezuela and Mexico , which appear to have developed a subsequent practice , the examination of which could help specify or clarify the content and scope of the unilateral commitment assumed by those countries in relation to the Central American countries through a joint communiqu which could be considered a unilateral act of collective origin . 
These two countries are using armed force on a daily basis against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in the two no-flight zones that they imposed by their unilateral decision , and these two countries are supporting , funding and training terrorist groups for the purpose of undermining Iraqs security and threatening its territorial integrity . 
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
Such confidence and security-building measures can be pursued at various levels , bilateral , subregional , regional and multilateral even unilateral measures are conceivable and can be applied flexibly to conform to the political and security characteristics and requirements of specific situations .  
A unilateral statement formulated by a State or an international organization when signing , ratifying , formally confirming , accepting , approving or acceding to a treaty , or by a State when making a notification of succession to a treaty , whereby the State or international organization subjects its consent to be bound by the treaty to a specific interpretation of the treaty or of certain provisions thereof , shall constitute a conditional interpretative declaration .  
By way of the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq , they have been continuing their military aggression against our people on a daily basis since 1991 by virtue of a unilateral and illegal decision taken by their governments in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
Those factors included : continued high dependence on food imports ; a direct linkage between rural agricultural viability and poverty reduction ; difficulties in balancing the short-term benefits of food aid and its long-term impact ; severe adjustment costs arising from unilateral liberalization of the agricultural sector ; non-competitiveness of agricultural exports in the world market ; and high dependence of foreign exchange earnings on exports of one or two agricultural commodity under preferential market access .  
As regards interpretative declarations , the Special Rapporteur indicated that , in general , they were linked to a prior text , but was of the view that in cases where the declarations went beyond the obligations contained in the treaty , the declarations would become independent acts whereby a State could assume international commitments ; these interpretative declarations would thus be included among the unilateral acts falling within the scope of the topic .  
Some members reiterated the importance of the topic and expressed satisfaction with references made in the report to doctrine and judicial decisions on unilateral acts , though it was also stated that additional factual information on the cases cited would be most helpful in analysing the legal validity of unilateral acts .  
It was stated that the suggested draft articles contained some contradictory elements in that they posed intention as a primary criterion yet placed among the supplementary means of interpretation the main ways in which intention could be asserted in connection with a unilateral act , namely preparatory work and the circumstances at the time of the acts formulation .  
Given the attention being paid to international norms for products entering trade , it was an important step that development partners committed to providing assistance to least developed countries in developing infrastructure to ensure quality control and conformity to international standards of their products and to avoiding taking unilateral action in a manner inconsistent with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization .  
In the resolution , the Assembly , inter alia , urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that were not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or were inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravened the basic principles of the multilateral trading system .  
In accordance with paragraph 2 of the resolution , our country is making steady and active efforts to prevent the use , in violation of decisions made by the relevant United Nations organs , of unilateral measures of economic and political coercion inconsistent with the norms of international law and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations as a means of applying pressure on independent developing States .  
The adoption of laws encouraging the use of unilateral coercive economic measures in order to achieve political objectives constitutes a flagrant violation of the rules of international law , particularly the principles , objectives and rules governing trade among nations .  
Beyond the escalation represented by the legislation known as the Torricelli and the Helms-Burton acts , together with the additional measures adopted towards the end of 2000 as part of the Cuba blockade policy , the fact that a new Administration with recognized ties to the Miami terrorist groups has taken office has only increased the danger that the unilateral measures and the brutal war directed against the Cuban people will be intensified .  
The international community can not remain indifferent to the risk posed by the proliferation of unilateral coercive economic measures , especially extraterritorial ones , and it must therefore move quickly to take suitable action to put an end to such practices .  
The United Nations and other organizations , whether of an international or regional character , have adopted an enormous number of resolutions condemning the use of unilateral coercive economic measures because of the great damage they do to the economies of the developing countries and their negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a just and non-discriminatory trading system .  
The Commission on Human Rights itself has stated that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has an adverse effect on the social and humanitarian situation of developing countries .  
For this reason , the Government of the Republic of Mali believes that the international community should adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and are contrary to the basic principles of the international trading system .  
In the light of these considerations and the purport of General Assembly resolution 54 / 200 , in particular paragraph 2 thereof , it is incumbent on the members of the international community to abide by the principle that unilateral coercive economic and political measures against States contravene the principles of the multilateral trading system .  
We believe that , apart from unilateral and bilateral steps in the area of nuclear disarmament , the time has come to start discussions on strategic issues within the framework of multilateral mechanisms , including among the five permanent members of the Security Council , who bear special responsibility for the fate of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , the CTBT and other international agreements .  
Within the framework of the trade liberalization that was advocated so much at the current time , there was a proliferation of coercive unilateral economic measures dictated by the developed countries with regard to developing countries for purely political purposes .  
In carrying out his mandate , the independent expert must respect a set of basic principles to be embodied in the resolution requesting his appointment , including international cooperation based on Article 2 of the United Nations Charter , the condemnation of unilateral actions , respect for the key role of States in action to combat impunity and the obligation to determine the responsibility of the perpetrators of human rights violations as an essential component of effective compensation and international cooperation through universally applicable mechanisms . 
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
In the light of the foregoing , we call upon you to intervene on the basis of the facts set forth above and to urge Kuwait to halt its unilateral exploitation of the shared transboundary oilfields , which causes the constant migration of our oil resources , and to reach agreement with Iraq on the manner in which these fields can be exploited so as to safeguard the rights of both parties .  
It follows from draft guideline 1.2.1 that , like a reservation , a conditional interpretative declaration is A unilateral statement formulated by a State or an international organization when signing , ratifying , formally confirming , accepting , approving or acceding to a treaty , or by a State when making a notification of succession to a treaty . 21 Any conditional interpretative declaration not made at any of these times is therefore late and can be envisaged only if all the contracting parties consent , at least tacitly , to do so .
