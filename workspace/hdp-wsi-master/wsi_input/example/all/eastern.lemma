Or it may hit the northern coastal areas of Zhejiang between tonight and early tomorrow morning .  
Influenced by the storm , from daytime to night today , it is still windy 6-8 degrees in the middle and northern part of the South Sea and and coastal area in Guangdong . It is downpour in the west of Guangdong , in the middle and and north of Guangxi , southern and western part of Hunan and most part of Guizhou . It is rainstorm in some places in western part of Guangdong , middle and western part of Guangxi , southern part of Hunan and eastern part of Guizhou .  
To correctly understand the relationship between economic development , political stability , social harmony and national security , to diligently promote all countries , regions and the whole world to travel on the road of peaceful development , to jointly discuss east Asian economic cooperation in the 21st century and forecasting the future development of eastern Asia are subjects being discussed at this informal meeting of heads of state in eastern Asia .  
The decreasing speed of eastern crude oil fields has slowed down clearly , whereas the increasing speed of western crude oil fields has been constantly accelerating .  The strategic pattern of " stabilizing the east and developing the west " has basically taken shape .  
Seizing the opportunity for common development with the western region , the eastern region should formulate concrete measures to actively train and provide qualified personnel for the western region ; it should encourage local outstanding personnel to seek new development in the western region and practically assist the latter in solving problems of want of human resources , instability of the cadre ranks , and an irrational cadre structure and distribution so as to promote the economic and social development of the western region together .  
As regards the level of higher education , there exists no wide gap between China 's central and western regions and its eastern region , and the absolute number of graduates in China 's central and western regions is a considerable figure .  All this proves highly beneficial to our efforts to develop the software industry in China 's central and western regions .  
He Guoqiang , secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee , answered : Chongqing is the only municipality in western regions as well as the key industrial and commercial city in the southwest region .  The Chang Jiang golden waterways have linked Chongqing to both eastern and western regions .  Thus , Chongqing should serve as a bridge linking the east with the west and making them promote each other .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
People from eastern regions participating in the grand development of western regions come with the purpose of " mining the gold . "  As such western regions must have gold that can be mined and must present strong and advantageous points to attract outside capital , technology , management , and personnel .  
In the view of a foreign trade expert , Cheng Shichang , Zhejiang 's economic structure and export pattern are quite representative in eastern China . Following China 's accession to the WTO and the gradual abolition of passive quotas , its advantages will surely be further demonstrated .  
The eastern region has its own favorable conditions , and so do the central and western regions .  Therefore , what counts is how different regions can analyze and study their own favorable conditions in a realistic approach , establish a development strategy that suits each 's local conditions , and give a better rein to the existing superiorities while turning potential superiorities into realistic ones as soon as possible .  
The deputies and committee members said : Development of the western region is a major strategic decision made by the party Central Committee facing the new century .  The decision will not only speed up development in the western region , narrow the gap between the eastern and western regions , and boost development of the entire national economy , but also will have a bearing on the achievement of the third-step development strategic goals .  
[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
Xinjiang 's oil and cotton have initially become its advantages .  Fourth , the western region can absorb the valuable experience accumulated in the practice of foreign trade and economic cooperation in the coastal areas of the eastern region to constantly improve and develop its environment and conditions for foreign trade and economic cooperation and to speed up the formation of an opening-up economy , thus saving a lot of time and energy for opening up wider to the outside world and for developing its economy .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
5 ) After 21 years of rapid growth , China 's comprehensive national strength has been remarkably augmented , the eastern region has possessed considerable actual strength , and the central and western regions have basically resolved the problem of having enough to eat and wear , thus the state and the eastern region are capable of increasing the intensity of rendering support to the central and western development .  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
In particular , the eastern coastal areas should make efforts to establish the socialist market economy before other areas , realize the goal for the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises before other areas , complete the readjustment of the economic structure , and optimize and upgrade the industry before other areas , and realize basic agricultural modernization before other areas .  In short , they should work hard to realize modernization before other areas and make greater contribution to building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The people from the eastern , central , and western regions have reached a consensus : The grand western development is not only a historical turning point for the people of the western region to rouse themselves to catch up with the developed region and narrow the gap between them , but also a huge space for the eastern region to further its prosperity and development .  It is a common opportunity for both the eastern and western regions in China .  
He expressed hope that the two provinces could seize the present opportunity featured by the decision of the central authorities to implement a develop-the-west strategy and to accelerate the development of the country 's central and western regions ; work hard to transform their advantages in resources and in their geographic locations as a link between the country 's eastern and western regions into economic advantages in real terms ; and bring about a sustained , rapid , and healthy growth to each 's economy .  
Jiang Zemin said : China and Turkey are located respectively at the eastern and western ends of the Asian continent , and Turkey links the Asian and European continents .  It is of great significance that our two countries establish and develop on the basis of friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation a new relationship of cooperation and partnership characterized by mutual respect , mutual trust , equality and mutual benefit , long-term stability , and common development .  
In China , due to the unbalanced economic development , the central and western areas , where Chinese Moslems live in compact communities , lag behind the eastern areas and are still afflicted with poverty .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
Being the largest developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres , China and Brazil have the duties to play a positive role in propelling the healthy development of the world political and economic situations .  
In recent years the pace of development in China 's eastern region has caused people to look at it with new respect , while the Japanese economy is facing structural contradictions .  Added to these are the Asian financial crisis , the growing amount of bad assets held by banks , the sluggish progress of economic recovery , and worsening fiscal difficulties .  
Investment in the western areas increased obviously faster than that in the central and eastern parts of the country .  The high growth rate of investment was a result of the state 's policy to increase investment projects funded by national debt , and was also related to the fact that the base figure in the same period of last year was comparatively low and the construction periods this year moved ahead of schedule .  
Only by unifying the efforts of the party , the government , the army , the people , and the students as well as the efforts of various regions , including eastern , western , southern , northern , and central regions , will it be possible to build a strong and unified force for our " strike hard " struggle aimed at rectifying social order .  
An authoritative department reveals that in order to coordinate with the large-scale western development now in full swing in China , the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and other departments concerned will jointly select and assign excellent young cadres in stages and in groups from the Central Authorities , state organs , eastern region as well as important state-owned enterprises , universities and colleges of higher learning , and scientific research academies and institutes to go to the western region for tempering on suspended duties .  
The work of having the 13 eastern provinces and municipalities give support to the development of the 10 western provinces and autonomous regions is an important measure to implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of " two great prospects " to promote coordinated development of regional economy and reduce the economic gap between the east and the west regions .  
The southern Fujian fishing ground is among the Chinese fishing grounds abundant in aquatic products .  It is adjacent to the Zhoushan fishing grounds , the eastern Guangdong fishing grounds , and Taiwan 's shallow water fishing grounds and has an actual operational fishing ground as large as 26,000 sq . km . in area and shoals and surface as large as more than 200 sq . km .  
At a certain place in eastern China , a hunter chasing an animal in a dense forest suddenly came upon a sight that stopped him in his path : A unit of soldiers , wearing green berets , herb-spot camouflage uniforms , and white armbands were charging toward him , along with scores of tanks in camouflage ; the tanks were not displaying the " 1st August army emblem " but a triangular military emblem .  The hunter ran as fast as he could .  
Aleksandr Nikolasov , deputy director of the National Economic Forecast and Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences , stated : Over the past few years , the Russian Government and industrial circles have attached growing importance to exploiting energy resources in eastern Russia , and with large oil and gas fields discovered and verified in eastern and western Siberia and in Russia 's far east , and proven deposits outstripping future demand in those regions , Russia is bound to increase energy exports by a large margin . 
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .  
In 2015 , with the completion of major hydroelectric power bases and backbone power stations , all regional power networks will be linked to form a unified national joint power supply network .  The goal of " transmitting electric power from the western region to the eastern region " will be reached .  China can basically change the situation of shortage of electric power in the eastern region and thus further promote economic development .  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
More than a half of the state-owned units ' fixed assets investment have been placed in the eastern region , where five special economic zones , the Pudong Development District , 14 coastal open cities , and still more economic development zones have been established , and some preferential policies have been adopted to accelerate development , promote reform , and expand openness in this region , so that the economy in the eastern region has developed rapidly . 
Thanks to the originally sound economic foundation , better transport facilities , and more qualified personnel , it was more convenient for the eastern region to attract foreign capital and increase economic contacts with the countries and regions outside the country .  Obviously , focusing the development on the eastern region could reap greater and faster economic results , which was already proved by facts , as tremendous achievements in the economic development had been attained in the eastern region .  
First , we have been engaged in reform and opening up for more than 20 years , so that the country has considerably increased its economic strength , and the eastern region , in particular , has laid a relatively solid foundation for economic development and is capable of making further advance by mainly depending on its own efforts , thus enabling the country to shift the focus of development to the western region .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
In the future , the eastern region should more positively explore the modes of cooperation for mutual benefits in light of the market economic rules by way of , for example , going to make investment in the western region for the exploitation of natural resources , participating in some companies there through shareholding , transferring some commodities to the western region in which there are greater benefits in producing such commodities , and so forth . 
The central authorities adopted the policy decision of accelerating the development of the vast western region last year .  This is a strategic shift in China 's economic construction .  For a large country like China , it is undoubtedly not enough to have only a developed and prosperous eastern coastal region .  
On developing China 's western regions , Li Peng pointed out : Implementing the strategy for accelerating economic development in the western and central regions is a major policy decision of the CPC Central Committee , a decision oriented to the new century and having the whole situation taken into consideration .  It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .  
We Yi noted : The state has already extended a number of preferential policies to the western region to encourage the region to introduce foreign investment , and the western region should therefore acquire an adequate understanding and make a good use of these policies .  Meanwhile , it should also draw on the experiences of the country 's eastern coastal areas in introducing foreign investment .  
Wang Lequan noted that the central authorities have made large investments in the large-scale development of the western region and adopted many preferential policies .  However , the most fundamental thing is that we must rely on ourselves .  Years ago , the development in the eastern region did in a wrong way including redundant construction projects , environmental pollution and the bubble economy .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .

Therefore , the task of narrowing the development gap between the western and eastern regions to bring about regional economic and social revitalization and prosperity can not be accomplished with just one or two five-year plans or a 10-year program .  The task can only be eventually achieved through long-term and ceaseless efforts of many generations .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
While continuing to give play to the advantage of the eastern region , the strategy of the development of the western region will be implemented , the development of the central and western regions will be quickened , and mutual promotion and coordinate development between the eastern , central and western regions will be enhanced with sustained economic growth .  
Li Ruihuan said : The large-scale development of the western region is a strategic decision made by the CPC Central Committee according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's concept of " two general situations , " which will be of the utmost importance for the development of both the western and eastern regions and even for sustainable economic and social development throughout the country and for achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive and common prosperity for all people .  
For example , the special national policies for the eastern coastal regions created fast economic development and quick increases in wages in those areas .  This is an obvious example .  
Later he headed troops to give strategic chase to Kuomintang troops , liberating eastern China and many coastal islands .  After the founding of the New China , Comrade Su Yu was successively appointed deputy chief and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] .  Proceeding from the actual conditions of the army and state and the international environment , he made many major proposals to the CMC , making important contributions to building a modern defense and army .  
The pipeline will be more than 4,000 km long , running through nine provinces and autonomous regions in the western , central and eastern regions .  The total investment for its first-stage construction , including the building of some down-stream auxiliary projects , will be 120 billion yuan .  
While guiding intellectual resources to the western region , Wan Xueyuan said , we should enormously attract qualified personnel from the eastern region to participate in the economic construction and development of the western region , and also attract people from other countries , including Chinese students studying abroad and foreign experts .  
After the economically developed west , with its strong military forces , has been attacked and destroyed , Taiwan 's entire economic , political , and military systems will be in a state of chaos and paralysis , and no matter how strong the eastern defense base is , it will be unable to retrieve the war situation in the west .  
Second , as Anhui is the first stop in the industrial transference from the eastern region to the western region , we should take the initiative in receiving the radiation of the eastern region to develop our primary industry , and also spin-off projects and enterprises with certain technical content , good market prospects , and powerful pulling force to settle down in Anhui . 
India and Russia also signed 11 other agreements , including agreements on scientific and technological cooperation and on the joint exploration of petroleum and natural gas in areas off the coast of eastern India , and a memorandum of understanding on judicial cooperation .  
In the meantime , the living standards of the people in central and western regions have significantly improved ; the number of poor areas and impoverished people has continued to decrease ; and the gap between the actual incomes of urban and rural residents in eastern and western regions has somewhat narrowed .  
As the industrial structure continues to be optimized , the level of coordination and cooperation between central-western regions and the eastern part of the country will also be continuously upgraded ; the traditional mode of interaction between the resource supplying bases and processing bases will be broken down ; and all-dimension exchanges in capital , technology , human resources , and information will take place between the eastern and western regions .  
The export growth forecast for various regions in the first half of this year indicates that export in central regions grew by nearly 32 percent , exceeding the growth level of less than 28 percent in eastern regions .  The export growth rate in western regions also reached 27 percent , close to the comparable level in eastern regions .  
The development of the eastern regions has been and remains an extremely important force in supporting the overall national economy in finance , material , and technology , and is also an indispensable condition for supporting the western development and the accelerated development of central and west China .  
Politics and law departments in eastern China are urged to enhance mutual support and coordination with their western counterparts , help their counterparts strengthen material equipment building , improve their work , and help promote the simultaneous development of the political and legal work and economic construction in western regions .  
To put the large-scale western development into effect , we should also adapt our work to the requirements of instituting and perfecting a nationwide unified market system , seize the opportunity of opening to the domestic sectors , break down regional barriers , smash departmental and industrial monopoly , further open the markets , and encourage and support enterprises in the eastern and central regions to make investment and operate business in the western region .  
China 's existing economic structure is riddled with problems .  Primarily , the industrial structure ( the primary , secondary , tertiary , and within various industries ) is poor ; regional ( primarily the eastern , central , and western regions ) developments are not coordinated , and the standard of urbanization is low .  
Since the beginning of winter , there have been six major snowfalls in the eastern and central parts of Inner Mongolia . The low temperatures and accumulated snow throughout an extensive scope have become disastrous to 1.6 million people in 31 banners and counties of five leagues in the autonomous region , and a large number of domestic animals have frozen to death .  
To address the relatively tight power supply caused by Guangdong 's rapid economic development , Li Peng said : Guangdong should continue to do a good job in launching supporting projects to " bring electricity from western to eastern China , " and expedite restructuring of the electric power industry by " separating power grid management from power plant management " and by " introducing competitive prices for power distribution . "  
When referring to the economic characteristics of China 's western regions , observation team members said : Western regions ' economic structure is simpler than eastern regions ' , so it is easier to adjust .  Western regions are rich in mineral , zoological , botanical , and tourism resources .  Sichuan and Chongqing have good educational , scientific , and technological personnel .  
Shi Fenghai pointed out : It is expected that foreign capital will be concentrated first in high-profit business fields and areas - - international and domestic long-distance calls , IP telephony , Beijing , Shanghai , Guangzhou , and other important eastern areas will become the key business fields and areas which foreign capital will enter .  
For this reason , during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , we will expedite the construction of major projects of overall significance , including those aimed at bringing gas and electricity from western China to eastern China , diverting water from southern China to northern China , establishing national strategic petroleum reserves , and building a rail line into Tibet .  
Over the past year , ever since the beginning of the large-scale development of the western region , the people of the entire county have made use of this rare opportunity , laid a solid infrastructural foundation , and stepped up their cooperation with coastal areas in the country 's eastern region .  As a result , our advantage of having rich natural resources is being turned into a practical economic advantage .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : To implement the strategy for the extensive development of the west country , it not only requires plain living and hard struggle on the part of the broad ranks of cadres and masses in the west country over a long period of time , but also calls for energetic support from the people of the whole nation , especially of the eastern regions .  
The water-delivery canal for the east-line project is located in China 's eastern region where the economy is more advanced , township and town enterprises are better developed , and urbanization level is higher .  Thanks to the region 's efforts in recent several years , evident results have been attained in pollution control in the region .  However , the water samples taken from certain river sections in the region still fall below the standard of Class III required for water diversion .  
3 ) start 12 new and major projects , including the Qinghai-Tibet Railway , diverting gas from western China to eastern China , returning grain plots to forestry and grassland , and educational projects , with a total investment of 300 billion yuan ;  
There are now three options involving eastern , central , and western parts of China . The main purpose of diverting the water on the eastern and central fronts is to prevent pollution through diverting clean water to the north .  The project of diverting water on the western front can not be realized in the foreseeable future .  
It is necessary to promote development through opening up , to always persist in implement the strategy of opening to the outside world to bring along economic development , and to raise the level of our work in using resources at home and from abroad and both the international and domestic markets .  We should cater to the domestic market and seize business opportunities ; we should advance both east and west and make it possible for the eastern and western regions complement each other with their own advantages .  
County Chief Rou Zi Gu Li Ba Yi of Tashiku Erqiantajike Autonomous County said that within one year of the launching of the great strategy of developing the west , the county had strengthened cooperation with the eastern coastal region and turned ample resources into an economic advantage .  The strategy , he said , has already brought tangible benefits to the impoverished county located 4,000 meters above sea level on the Pamirs plateau that had been singled out to receive special government support .  
It is of great and far-reaching significance for narrowing the gap between the eastern and western regions in development , accelerating the process of China 's modernization drive , achieving the third-step strategic objective in the modernization of our country , promoting the unity and progress of various nationalities , realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , maintaining social stability , consolidating national defense , and achieving the lasting political stability of the country .

In recognition of the ecological importance of Long Valley , KCRC has carefully studied alternative alignments in addition to the gazetted alignment for the eastern end of the railway project , having regard to important factors including potential environmental impact , land use , planning requirements , engineering and operational feasibility as well as impact on local community .  
IAC is a spectacular summer arts festival featuring about 80 exciting performances from both overseas and local groups .  These performances comprise eastern and western dances , music , dramas , magic , mimes , puppet theatres and multi-media shows and will be staged between July 14 and August 27 .  
The Area is developed primarily for residential , passive recreation and conservation uses .  Low to medium density residential uses , and Government , institution and community ( GIC ) uses are concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the area .  The remaining part occupying about 65 per cent of the total area is reserved for open space and green belt uses .

In the Yung Long archaeological site , relics such as firing hearths , postholes , workshops for manufacturing stone tools and burials , as well as fine stone slotted rings and stone Yue ( ceremonial axe regarded as symbol of power ) imply the development of a more complex social structure and suggest that prehistoric Pearl River Delta had cultural exchanges with not just the northern and eastern part of Guangdong , but as far away as the eastern coast of China as well .  
To provide an attractive setting for civic events and land for both active and passive recreational activities , 16.6 hectares of land is zoned " Open Space " , which covers the existing open spaces and the future waterfront promenade that extends from the Central Reclamation Phase III in the west to the eastern end of the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter .  
It has been reported that the Government stated publicly some time ago that , after the implementation of the first stage of the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme , the water quality on the eastern side of Victoria Harbour had improved considerably , and the bacteria content therein had also dropped significantly to such a level that it was safe for people to swim in the water .  As such , it would actively consider resurrecting the cross-harbour swimming race that had been suspended for years in the Harbour .  
This was due largely to the development of an El Nino in the year , which was characterised by above normal sea surface temperatures in the equatorial eastern and central Pacific . The associated change in atmospheric steering flow caused tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific to turn towards the north before entering the South China Sea . 
Taiwan is surrounded by waters . The eastern coast of the island is rocky , with a sudden drop into the ocean . Its offshore waters form pathways for many species of migratory fish traveling both from the south and the north . The west coast has a gradual , inclined shelf .  
With the completion of the North Link Railroad between Suao and Hualien , a major port city at the northern end of the narrow coastal plain due to be completed by the end of this year , further development in eastern Taiwan is possible .  
In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
The Central Taiwan Vocational Training Center , the southern and northern Taiwan vocational training centers operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the Taishan vocational training center operated by the Ministry of the Interior , the first youth vocational training center run by the National Youth Commission , the northern provincial vocational training center , Taipei municipal vocational training center , eastern Taiwan vocational training center , and a vocational training center for retired servicemen .  
Looking at this list it is obvious that the foreign tourists ' knowledge of scenic spots relies on outdated information , and that recently developed scenic areas , such as the northern and eastern coasts and Orchid Island have not been sufficiently promoted abroad . This , in the end , is a great loss for the tourists themselves . "  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
This includes the establishment of centers for folk arts and popular handicrafts in southern and eastern Taiwan . In the north , Chinese culture parks will be set up . And at the same time at least five large-scale museums will be added to the present number . Exhibition halls displaying the unique features of local and indigenous products will become part and parcel of the cultural centers of every county and town .  
The majority are attracted by the numerous broad river estuaries and rich tidal marshes and mud-flats along Taiwan 's west coast , so there are far fewer migrant birds , and of fewer species , on the steeper eastern coast .  
But if cars can pass through on a new cross-island highway , people will just drive through , passing Yuli in an instant . " It 's like when the southern cross-island highway was built , " he says . " At first everyone at the eastern starting point of Haituan was vigorously in favor of opening the road , thinking that people would be able to get to Taitung in only an hour , but since then the city has been in gradual decline . "  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
This is quite different from the sandy beaches characteristic of other parts of the island . Another special feature of the eastern coast is the sharply rising coral reefs and rock platforms . There are many types of colorful channels and caves cut into the coral reefs by erosion .  
The main motive why Master Hsiao Yun , who has worked as a university professor in the past , decided to found a university was to develop students " who will truly be able to use technology to improve the human condition . " Master Cheng Yan set up the Tzu Chi nursing and medical schools to upgrade medical resources in eastern Taiwan , and to cultivate " beneficent doctors " with a spirit of compassion in an effort to help solve the problem of young girls in eastern Taiwan who have neither education nor employment .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
The year before last , Wong Ka Kue , lead singer of the Hong Kong pop group Beyond , fell from the stage while performing in Japan and thereafter remained in a coma , diagnosed as brain dead . One of the group 's fans went to seek a divination at Wong Tai Sin Temple , and got the answer : " A wild wind swept through the eastern garden last night / Tearing out all the flowers / But fortunately the gardener rose early / And replanted their roots to restore them to life . "  
Jade articles from the Liangzhu culture of Zhe-jiang Province include jade cong ( rectangular blocks with a circular hole through the middle ) carved with patterns ; huan ( discs with a large hole ) incised with images thought to depict Chi You , the eastern tribe leader slain by Huangdi ; jade bi ( ritual discs with a hole in the center ) incised with magical images , and so on .  
Take , for instance , Lai Ho , the father of Taiwan 's new literature , who started his career writing classical poems . In old age , when he was very ill , he wrote " The Setting Sun " about Japanese imperialism in its final moments : " The sun 's slanting rays yellow as west it creeps / For what place has brilliance left so soon ? / How short men 's torment in the bitter heat / Behind them rises the waxing eastern moon . "  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
This has led to land subsidence along both the eastern and western coasts . On a map of river water quality produced by the EPA , 50 of Taiwan 's major and minor rivers are colored black or brown from their mouths to their middle and upper reaches , indicating that they are heavily or moderately polluted .  
In the 1720s Burlington 's garden became something that had never been seen before . Its eastern section was in the formal classical style , with three radiating shaded avenues leading in straight lines to classical monuments . In the western part , though , Kent had created an irregular natural style , with groups of small trees and winding paths !  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
Most of Taiwan 's venomous snakes live in low-altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside . But the hundred-pace viper , which was never very numerous , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern Taiwan . It grows to one-and-a-half meters or more-much the same length as the habu and cobra-but being far thicker and meatier it is much valued by gourmands .  
Elsewhere in the ROC the traditional Han Chinese culture was southern Fujianese . Meanwhile , eastern Fujian itself has experienced such rapid develpment that almost all of its traditional architecture has been destroyed . The traditional eastern Fujianese settlements on Matsu are just about the only ones left in pristine condition anywhere in the world .  
The architecture of the temples is of the eastern Fujian style , with granite walls and featuring colorful , intricate decorations , in sharp contrast to the plain buildings around them . Squatting in the entrance of a temple on a hillside , looking out across the sea-which shines golden in the light of the setting sun and is dotted with little fishing craft-one feels a strong sense of the endless ebb and flow of history .  
Kuanshan Township is located on eastern Taiwan 's main north-south highway . The township is ringed by a 12-kilometer bicycle trail , three to four meters wide , with a concrete surface all the way . The trail is marked off with red bricks , and every 100 meters colored bricks are set in the ground in all kinds of patterns , to remind you that you have advanced another 100 meters !  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
In this issue are stories on the latest trends and options for graduate study , the changing structure of Taiwan 's population , the impact of environmental hormones , the community regeneration movement in aboriginal villages in eastern Taiwan , the legendary master of glove puppetry Huang Hai-tai , the beginning of efforts to stage Nobel Prize laureate Gao Xingjian 's Snow in August , and celebrities such as Angie Chai and Chien Wen-hsiu . Kick back , relax and read , and get a better understanding of our society , our home .  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
" Setting down roots and deepening our impact is the real hard job , " says Yu Mei-nu . To help close the gap between town and country , two years ago they began organizing women 's groups in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan to create the NUTWA , to create a platform for information and resource sharing . They are now moving to use the Internet to link women 's groups across the island .  
After the western Taiwan high-speed transportation network is established , the future will bring construction projects for eastern , central and southern Taiwan where the terrain presents even greater difficulties ; and it can be predicted that the transportation , economic and environmental challenges will be greater , so that society will have greater expectations and exert more supervision .  
" Look over there . A magnificent and auspicious blue view has appeared in the heavens . Thus embellished , that row of bare precipices from Yushan 's main summit to its eastern peak at that moment is like a rainbow , reflecting a dazzling auburn light . The creases on the mountain walls gently project a restrained cobalt blue . "  
Its towering presence is beyond the power of words to describe . Additionally , the summit provides a panoramic view of the main sources of water that nourish the land . The Nantsaihsien River and Laonung River are the sources of southern Taiwan 's Kaoping River ; the Chenyoulan River , largest tributary of central Taiwan 's Choshui River , winds its way to the northwest ; and the valley of the Lakulaku River , which feeds eastern Taiwan 's Hsiukuluan River , is also visible in the distance .  
Mt . Helan , stretching more than 250 km from south to north , is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia , the two large autonomous regions .  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China , it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current .  
This brutal aggression extended to all parts of Iraq , from the far north to the extreme south and from the remote west to the eastern boundaries .  
It should be recalled that the first phase ( five years ) of this endeavour will be the strengthening of existing regional economic communities in west , eastern , central , southern and north Africa .  
The projections of carrying capacity for eastern Kenya accounted for density patterns , agro-ecological zones , minimum farm size needed to sustain an average household each year ( calculated by considering food-crop yields and calories derived from food crops ) , total area , and cultivable area .  
A main conclusion of this study is that eastern Kenya 's limited resource base and rapid rate of population growth require comprehensive rural and regional development planning .  
The above letters contain tendentious and untrue charges concerning the alleged involvement of the Army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in incidents in the territory of eastern Slavonia contrary to the reports of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that confirmed a long time ago that the former Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) has left the United Nations Protected Areas ( UNPAs ) of the Republic of Serbian Krajina .  
Within the project on " Coastal Marine Pollution Monitoring and Training : Asia Pacific Mussel Watch " , UNU is seeking to analyse and monitor key hazardous chemicals and substances in the coastal marine areas of the Asia-Pacific region , including relative levels of important agricultural and industrial halogenated hydrocarbons in the eastern Pacific .  
The primary objectives of ECE for the biennium 1996-1997 , in response to the ongoing political and economic changes in the countries of central and eastern Europe , are the integration of these and other less developed countries in the region into the European and global economy and the consolidation of reforms .

To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr . Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , has not only failed to influence the so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs positively , but has effectively encouraged them to intensify their military option and ethnic cleansing .  
In a letter dated 14 December 1994 ( S / 1994 / 1418 ) from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 724 ( 1991 ) concerning Yugoslavia , the Council was informed of a major resurgence of diphtheria in several countries in central Asia and eastern Europe , and of the fact that the only available stocks of anti-serum to combat that serious condition were located in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) .  
Models of international trade and the experience of fast-growing developing countries also imply that in order for the transition economies of central and eastern Europe to achieve long-term growth rates significantly higher than those of the developed economies , which by now have become their major trading partners , continuous and rapid improvement will be needed in their exports . 
Building upon earlier activities and based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the coastal and marine pollution loads from land-based sources in the eastern African subregion , including the Comoros and Seychelles , the planned development of a regional overview and strategy will lead to the implementation of various additional activities , such as monitoring programmes .  
Building upon earlier activities and based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the coastal and marine pollution loads from land-based sources in the eastern African subregion , including the Comoros and Seychelles , the planned development of a regional overview and strategy will lead to the implementation of various additional activities , such as monitoring programmes .  
mandates approved by the intergovernmental bodies which had been reflected in the proposed programme budget included such important topics as the respective roles of the market and the State in economic and social development , and the continuation of economic and social reforms in central and eastern Europe .  
We are still concerned about the ongoing , complex and uncertain situation in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova and we reaffirm the necessity for an unconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops from the Transdniester region .  
It is rather incongruous that the same forces that are at the forefront of the effort to establish democratic institutions and representative governments in certain parts of the world are also engaged in an enterprise which , if successful , is calculated to destroy the free and democratic way of life in the eastern Caribbean .  
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
The information furnished contained general data on the trajectory of the planned flight of the shuttle above a specific swathe of eastern regions of the USSR and indicated the period of time during which the craft was expected to be located above the territory of the Soviet Union during its descent from orbit , its minimum flight altitude in that airspace before its entry into the Earth 's atmosphere above open sea , and technical details of the craft 's state .  
The participants in the workshop made the following recommendations , applicable to countries in central and eastern Europe : criminal law and procedure should be reviewed to determine any discriminatory provisions and effects ; consideration should be given to making rape in marriage a criminal offence ; criminal justice practitioners should be sensitized to the dynamics of domestic violence ; the police should be given specific and intensive training in crisis intervention and in the collection of evidence in domestic disputes .  
The recipients , selected among 106 nominees from Africa , Asia , Latin America and the Caribbean , eastern Europe and the CIS , focused their work on a wide range of topics , such as illegal arms and drug trafficking , money-laundering , organized crime , reform of the correctional system , juvenile delinquency , computerization of criminal justice information and crime prevention .  
Canada has reported that the five major groupings of criminal organizations operating in the country are outlaw motorcycle groups and Aboriginal , Asian , eastern European and Italian organized crime groups , while there is evidence that Colombian drug cartels and the Jamaican " posses " are also active . 
In order to support the eastern and southern regions with planned rural development projects , the Department for Priority Regions for Development was established within the State Planning Organization , and based upon certain socio-economic criteria the 28 least developed provinces were identified and included in a specific programme within the planned development projects .  
Although it is difficult to make precise statements about the contribution of the various components of domestic demand to overall growth ( because of the often large statistical discrepancies in the national accounts ) , it does appear that fixed investment is now playing an increasingly important role in the economic recovery of eastern Europe .  
Democratic and pluralistic political systems have been established ; central planning and State controls have been dismantled : prices have been liberalized , most eastern European currencies are convertible , and consumers and producers are essentially free to make decisions according to their preferences .  
The activities of FAO in support of the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe and CIS concentrate on support for the implementation of economic and institutional reforms undertaken since the early 1990s as they involve and affect the agricultural and rural sector and , through assistance in approaching sustainable development , on support for the integration of the agriculture of these countries into the world economy .  
A major study on the role and status of rural women in the central and eastern European countries is instrumental in designing a plan of action to assist rural women in the transition and constituted a part of the preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 .  
A major regional project covering 26 countries in eastern Europe and CIS was launched in 1995 and executed by ECE to assist national statistical offices in developing the human resources necessary for building self-sustainable capabilities for the collection , processing and analysis of reliable social and demographic statistics , and enabling the appropriate governmental institutions and agencies of these countries to monitor the social aspects of development .  
A positive example for landlocked countries that lie in the centre of continents is that of Switzerland and Austria , which have served as successful hosts for short-cut routes through the Alps , providing connections from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe - with notable benefits to their own economies , among the world 's most successful and richest .  
As reported at the consultation of the whole , on 18 September 1996 , at approximately 0200 hours local time , a 350-ton , 106-foot military submarine was found about 100 feet offshore , grounded in shallow water near the coastal city of Kangnung , one of the major ports on the eastern coast of the Republic of Korea .  
Whereas the current situation in eastern Zaire is purely internal , the international community can not remain aloof without seeking solutions aimed at halting the intensification of ethnic cleansing and genocide in eastern Zaire .  
Concerned about the dramatic humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire and encouraged by this statement by the Rwandan authorities , the High Commissioner is transmitting a message through the local media , reassuring the refugees that , while UNHCR would try to do everything possible to assist them where they are , the Office would be ready to help them back in Rwanda and had for that purpose increased its reception and assistance capacities inside Rwanda .  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
I have the honour to inform you that an extraordinary session of the central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution at ministerial level was held today , 11 November 1996 , at Addis Ababa to consider the current crisis in the Great Lakes region with special reference to eastern Zaire .  
The Security Council in resolution 1078 ( 1996 ) urged Member States on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the Organization of African Unity , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary orderly and secure repatriation of refugees .  
For countries like Madagascar , South-South and regional cooperation had become a necessary strategy for promoting national , regional and global development through collective autonomy , which was a basic tool for stimulating growth , technologies and accelerated development .  Madagascar was involved in the Indian Ocean Commission and had participated in the work of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) , which united the countries of eastern and southern Africa .  
Security Council resolution 1080 ( 1996 ) established a two-part mandate for the multinational force : facilitating the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organizations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire ; and facilitating the voluntary , orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons .  
After consulting with our partners in the Steering Group , Canada has now concluded that , with the return to Rwanda of the majority of refugees , the dispersal of the remaining number over large areas of eastern Zaire and the growing access of international humanitarian agencies to the remaining refugees , displaced persons and civilians at risk , the multinational force at the current authorized force level has very little utility .  
Nevertheless , the conflict that engulfed eastern Zaire and the sudden and large-scale return of Rwandans from Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania at the end of 1996 posed unprecedented challenges for UNHCR , both in terms of providing humanitarian assistance in the midst of conflict and of supporting massive reintegration in a fragile post-conflict environment .  
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 58 on this situation decided to request " the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Zaire and on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and a member of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to carry out a joint mission to investigate allegations of massacres and other issues affecting human rights which arise from the situation prevailing in eastern Zaire since September 1996 " .  
The European Union , wishing to respond to the challenges of the post-cold-war world , proposes to take up three major challenges over the years ahead : the establishment of an economic and monetary union ; the strengthening of its institutional base through the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty ; and preparation for further enlargement towards the eastern and southern Europe .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
Given this appalling situation , we urge the international community , as represented by its specialized organizations and institutions and first and foremost by the Security Council , the International Committee of the Red Cross , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the States signatories to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , to discharge their humanitarian responsibilities and obligations by condemning these most heinous violations committed by the criminal Ethiopian Tigray forces against the civilians and soldiers who have fallen victim to the brutal aggression launched on our eastern borders .  
At his initial appearance on 31 May 1996 before Trial Chamber I , composed of Judge Jorda ( presiding ) , Judge Odio-Benito and Judge Riad , Dra _ en Erdemovi _ pleaded guilty to one count of a crime against humanity for his participation in the summary execution of approximately 1,200 unarmed civilian Muslim men at a farm near Pilica , located in the Zvornik municipality of eastern Bosnia , following the fall of Srebrenica to Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995 .  
Increasing the value added to the processing of local raw materials ; the transformation of hides and skins into exportable leather products in eight eastern and southern African countries ; the manufacture of wood products in order to provide opportunities for the environmentally sustainable development of forest resources in seven western and central African countries ; the processing of spices and aromatic products in Zanzibar ; and the introduction of new techniques for the production of salt in the Plateau State of Nigeria ;  
For decades , it has been growing dangerously worse and , as part of this process , the structural adjustment policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the countries of the southern hemisphere and in central and eastern Europe are having disastrous social consequences .  
In central and eastern Europe , where the implementation rate according to the above figures is already somewhat higher than in the other two regions under review , recent regional initiatives aim at the introduction of harmonized legal , infrastructural and logistic conditions that would allow countries in the same subregion to conduct joint controlled deliveries .  
Future activities envisaged by the resource committee on correctional systems and rights include a model seminar using the Manual for other central and eastern European States , the use of selected parts of the Manual in a seminar on prisoners rights for African participants , a joint initiative with Penal Reform International and an international symposium planned for the third quarter of 1997 .  
On the initiative of the Government of Togo , the Central Organ of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution , meeting at the ministerial level during the sixty-fifth ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of OAU , held in Tripoli from 24 to 28 February 1997 , decided to hold in Lom a special session of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Central Organ in order to consider the situation in the Great Lakes region , with particular reference to eastern Zaire .  
However , a number of security incidents have hindered humanitarian activities in the central and southern regions of the country , while difficulties continue to be experienced with the free circulation of people in the areas controlled by UNITA in the northern and eastern parts of Angola .  
While in the majority of African countries manufacturing output stagnated , strong performance was recorded for the northern and eastern subregions , with growth rates of 4.2 per cent and 5.3 per cent , respectively , sustained by strong domestic demand as well as buoyant inflows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) .  
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
While the greatest importance is often attached to imports of capital goods , it should be stressed that imports of manufactured intermediates also play a major role in the modernization of production structures , upgrading the quality of output , and generating positive spillovers to the rest of the economy . 3 The import structure of the eastern European transition economies thus appears to be consistent with efforts to restructure their economies . 
The crises of the past year or so in Albania and Bulgaria have highlighted the issues in a dramatic fashion , but many of the constituent elements of the problems in those countries - low quality of banks ' asset portfolios , " cosy relationships " between banks , state-owned enterprises and ministries , weak or non-existent regulation , and a widespread , popular mistrust of the banking system - are present in varying degrees elsewhere in eastern Europe and in the CIS .  
Nevertheless , the conflict that engulfed eastern Zaire and the sudden and large-scale return of Rwandans from Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania at the end of 1996 posed unprecedented challenges for UNHCR both in terms of providing humanitarian assistance in the midst of conflict and of supporting massive reintegration in a fragile post-conflict environment .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
With the advance of the Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo ( ADFL ) in eastern Zaire and the consequent elimination of rear bases of armed Hutu rebels close to the Burundi-Zaire border , the security situation in Burundi gradually improved during the first months of 1997 , though strong pockets of rebels remained within the former Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) near Fizi , Kalemie and Moba - enabling them to launch operations against targets in Burundi , including the Government 's military strongholds of Bururi and Makamba provinces .  
After years of living under centrally planned regimes where the private sector hardly existed as in the countries of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union most fledgling entrepreneurs lacked financial and business experience and the facilities were not available for them to start operating .  
The programme activities of UNDCP are contained in seven programmes by geographic region plus one global programme : sub-Saharan Africa ; north Africa and the Middle East ; central and eastern Europe ; west and central Asia ; south Asia ; east Asia and the Pacific ; and Latin America and the Caribbean .  
In central and eastern Europe , UNDCP will support further development of the Subregional Drug Control Cooperation Programme on the basis of the memorandum of understanding signed at Prague in 1995 , initiated to provide a comprehensive response to drug-control challenges posed by east-west and south-north illicit trafficking and growing drug abuse .  
However , the separatist authorities which were in control of the eastern part of the country continued to violate the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights of the Moldovan people .  
On behalf of the Ministry of Human Rights , I extend my sincere thanks to the national human rights organizations and eminent Congolese civilians who , at the risk of their lives , have provided the Ministry with information on serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the eastern provinces , thereby contributing to the preparation of this white paper .  
The table appended to this document is only a snapshot , giving no more than an indication , albeit a revealing one , of the blatant , deliberate and massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Rwandan , Ugandan and Burundian aggressors in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Member States in eastern Europe should be encouraged to actively cooperate and participate in the international scientific and technological research programmes on the International Space Station , as their involvement could provide major economic and social benefits for the region .  
The economic and social factors include : widespread loss of human life , destruction of social and economic infrastructure , environmental degradation , food insecurity and malnutrition _ with the additional losses caused by the floods and earthquakes which struck south _ western and north _ eastern Afghanistan in 1998 _ high levels of unemployment and poverty , and further increases in illicit drug production .  
The post-eruptive residual volcanic activity has included occasional collapse of the lava dome to generate pyroclastic flows , vigorous venting of ash and gas sometimes accompanied by small explosions and the generation of small but mobile pyroclastic flows , occasional swarms of volcano-tectonic earthquakes , and continued ground deformation on the eastern flanks of the volcano .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the document entitled " White paper on massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) and their Congolese accomplices in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo : Volume II " , covering the period from 6 November 1998 to 15 April 1999 ( see annex ) .  
In the first volume of the white paper , the Ministry of Human Rights concentrated on the massive violations of human rights and of the basic rules of international humanitarian law by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
To take note of the recommendations of the regional preparatory conferences for Africa and the Middle East , for Asia and the Pacific , for eastern Europe and for Latin America and the Caribbean that are relevant to efforts made at the global and regional levels , as set forth in sections A and B , respectively , of the annex to the present Declaration , and to call upon the international community , to the extent feasible , to consider those recommendations in appropriate forums ;

The decreasing speed of eastern crude oil fields has slowed down clearly , whereas the increasing speed of western crude oil fields has been constantly accelerating .  The strategic pattern of " stabilizing the east and developing the west " has basically taken shape .  
Seizing the opportunity for common development with the western region , the eastern region should formulate concrete measures to actively train and provide qualified personnel for the western region ; it should encourage local outstanding personnel to seek new development in the western region and practically assist the latter in solving problems of want of human resources , instability of the cadre ranks , and an irrational cadre structure and distribution so as to promote the economic and social development of the western region together .  
As regards the level of higher education , there exists no wide gap between China 's central and western regions and its eastern region , and the absolute number of graduates in China 's central and western regions is a considerable figure .  All this proves highly beneficial to our efforts to develop the software industry in China 's central and western regions .  
He Guoqiang , secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee , answered : Chongqing is the only municipality in western regions as well as the key industrial and commercial city in the southwest region .  The Chang Jiang golden waterways have linked Chongqing to both eastern and western regions .  Thus , Chongqing should serve as a bridge linking the east with the west and making them promote each other .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
People from eastern regions participating in the grand development of western regions come with the purpose of " mining the gold . "  As such western regions must have gold that can be mined and must present strong and advantageous points to attract outside capital , technology , management , and personnel .  
In the view of a foreign trade expert , Cheng Shichang , Zhejiang 's economic structure and export pattern are quite representative in eastern China . Following China 's accession to the WTO and the gradual abolition of passive quotas , its advantages will surely be further demonstrated .  
The eastern region has its own favorable conditions , and so do the central and western regions .  Therefore , what counts is how different regions can analyze and study their own favorable conditions in a realistic approach , establish a development strategy that suits each 's local conditions , and give a better rein to the existing superiorities while turning potential superiorities into realistic ones as soon as possible .  
The deputies and committee members said : Development of the western region is a major strategic decision made by the party Central Committee facing the new century .  The decision will not only speed up development in the western region , narrow the gap between the eastern and western regions , and boost development of the entire national economy , but also will have a bearing on the achievement of the third-step development strategic goals .  
[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
Xinjiang 's oil and cotton have initially become its advantages .  Fourth , the western region can absorb the valuable experience accumulated in the practice of foreign trade and economic cooperation in the coastal areas of the eastern region to constantly improve and develop its environment and conditions for foreign trade and economic cooperation and to speed up the formation of an opening-up economy , thus saving a lot of time and energy for opening up wider to the outside world and for developing its economy .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
5 ) After 21 years of rapid growth , China 's comprehensive national strength has been remarkably augmented , the eastern region has possessed considerable actual strength , and the central and western regions have basically resolved the problem of having enough to eat and wear , thus the state and the eastern region are capable of increasing the intensity of rendering support to the central and western development .  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
In particular , the eastern coastal areas should make efforts to establish the socialist market economy before other areas , realize the goal for the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises before other areas , complete the readjustment of the economic structure , and optimize and upgrade the industry before other areas , and realize basic agricultural modernization before other areas .  In short , they should work hard to realize modernization before other areas and make greater contribution to building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The people from the eastern , central , and western regions have reached a consensus : The grand western development is not only a historical turning point for the people of the western region to rouse themselves to catch up with the developed region and narrow the gap between them , but also a huge space for the eastern region to further its prosperity and development .  It is a common opportunity for both the eastern and western regions in China .  
He expressed hope that the two provinces could seize the present opportunity featured by the decision of the central authorities to implement a develop-the-west strategy and to accelerate the development of the country 's central and western regions ; work hard to transform their advantages in resources and in their geographic locations as a link between the country 's eastern and western regions into economic advantages in real terms ; and bring about a sustained , rapid , and healthy growth to each 's economy .  
Jiang Zemin said : China and Turkey are located respectively at the eastern and western ends of the Asian continent , and Turkey links the Asian and European continents .  It is of great significance that our two countries establish and develop on the basis of friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation a new relationship of cooperation and partnership characterized by mutual respect , mutual trust , equality and mutual benefit , long-term stability , and common development .  
In China , due to the unbalanced economic development , the central and western areas , where Chinese Moslems live in compact communities , lag behind the eastern areas and are still afflicted with poverty .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
Being the largest developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres , China and Brazil have the duties to play a positive role in propelling the healthy development of the world political and economic situations .  
In recent years the pace of development in China 's eastern region has caused people to look at it with new respect , while the Japanese economy is facing structural contradictions .  Added to these are the Asian financial crisis , the growing amount of bad assets held by banks , the sluggish progress of economic recovery , and worsening fiscal difficulties .  
Investment in the western areas increased obviously faster than that in the central and eastern parts of the country .  The high growth rate of investment was a result of the state 's policy to increase investment projects funded by national debt , and was also related to the fact that the base figure in the same period of last year was comparatively low and the construction periods this year moved ahead of schedule .  
Only by unifying the efforts of the party , the government , the army , the people , and the students as well as the efforts of various regions , including eastern , western , southern , northern , and central regions , will it be possible to build a strong and unified force for our " strike hard " struggle aimed at rectifying social order .  
An authoritative department reveals that in order to coordinate with the large-scale western development now in full swing in China , the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and other departments concerned will jointly select and assign excellent young cadres in stages and in groups from the Central Authorities , state organs , eastern region as well as important state-owned enterprises , universities and colleges of higher learning , and scientific research academies and institutes to go to the western region for tempering on suspended duties .  
The work of having the 13 eastern provinces and municipalities give support to the development of the 10 western provinces and autonomous regions is an important measure to implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of " two great prospects " to promote coordinated development of regional economy and reduce the economic gap between the east and the west regions .  
The southern Fujian fishing ground is among the Chinese fishing grounds abundant in aquatic products .  It is adjacent to the Zhoushan fishing grounds , the eastern Guangdong fishing grounds , and Taiwan 's shallow water fishing grounds and has an actual operational fishing ground as large as 26,000 sq . km . in area and shoals and surface as large as more than 200 sq . km .  
At a certain place in eastern China , a hunter chasing an animal in a dense forest suddenly came upon a sight that stopped him in his path : A unit of soldiers , wearing green berets , herb-spot camouflage uniforms , and white armbands were charging toward him , along with scores of tanks in camouflage ; the tanks were not displaying the " 1st August army emblem " but a triangular military emblem .  The hunter ran as fast as he could .  
Aleksandr Nikolasov , deputy director of the National Economic Forecast and Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences , stated : Over the past few years , the Russian Government and industrial circles have attached growing importance to exploiting energy resources in eastern Russia , and with large oil and gas fields discovered and verified in eastern and western Siberia and in Russia 's far east , and proven deposits outstripping future demand in those regions , Russia is bound to increase energy exports by a large margin . 
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .  
In 2015 , with the completion of major hydroelectric power bases and backbone power stations , all regional power networks will be linked to form a unified national joint power supply network .  The goal of " transmitting electric power from the western region to the eastern region " will be reached .  China can basically change the situation of shortage of electric power in the eastern region and thus further promote economic development .  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
More than a half of the state-owned units ' fixed assets investment have been placed in the eastern region , where five special economic zones , the Pudong Development District , 14 coastal open cities , and still more economic development zones have been established , and some preferential policies have been adopted to accelerate development , promote reform , and expand openness in this region , so that the economy in the eastern region has developed rapidly . 
Thanks to the originally sound economic foundation , better transport facilities , and more qualified personnel , it was more convenient for the eastern region to attract foreign capital and increase economic contacts with the countries and regions outside the country .  Obviously , focusing the development on the eastern region could reap greater and faster economic results , which was already proved by facts , as tremendous achievements in the economic development had been attained in the eastern region .  
First , we have been engaged in reform and opening up for more than 20 years , so that the country has considerably increased its economic strength , and the eastern region , in particular , has laid a relatively solid foundation for economic development and is capable of making further advance by mainly depending on its own efforts , thus enabling the country to shift the focus of development to the western region .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
In the future , the eastern region should more positively explore the modes of cooperation for mutual benefits in light of the market economic rules by way of , for example , going to make investment in the western region for the exploitation of natural resources , participating in some companies there through shareholding , transferring some commodities to the western region in which there are greater benefits in producing such commodities , and so forth . 
The central authorities adopted the policy decision of accelerating the development of the vast western region last year .  This is a strategic shift in China 's economic construction .  For a large country like China , it is undoubtedly not enough to have only a developed and prosperous eastern coastal region .  
On developing China 's western regions , Li Peng pointed out : Implementing the strategy for accelerating economic development in the western and central regions is a major policy decision of the CPC Central Committee , a decision oriented to the new century and having the whole situation taken into consideration .  It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .  
We Yi noted : The state has already extended a number of preferential policies to the western region to encourage the region to introduce foreign investment , and the western region should therefore acquire an adequate understanding and make a good use of these policies .  Meanwhile , it should also draw on the experiences of the country 's eastern coastal areas in introducing foreign investment .  
Wang Lequan noted that the central authorities have made large investments in the large-scale development of the western region and adopted many preferential policies .  However , the most fundamental thing is that we must rely on ourselves .  Years ago , the development in the eastern region did in a wrong way including redundant construction projects , environmental pollution and the bubble economy .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .

It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .

Therefore , the task of narrowing the development gap between the western and eastern regions to bring about regional economic and social revitalization and prosperity can not be accomplished with just one or two five-year plans or a 10-year program .  The task can only be eventually achieved through long-term and ceaseless efforts of many generations .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
While continuing to give play to the advantage of the eastern region , the strategy of the development of the western region will be implemented , the development of the central and western regions will be quickened , and mutual promotion and coordinate development between the eastern , central and western regions will be enhanced with sustained economic growth .  
Li Ruihuan said : The large-scale development of the western region is a strategic decision made by the CPC Central Committee according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's concept of " two general situations , " which will be of the utmost importance for the development of both the western and eastern regions and even for sustainable economic and social development throughout the country and for achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive and common prosperity for all people .  
For example , the special national policies for the eastern coastal regions created fast economic development and quick increases in wages in those areas .  This is an obvious example .  
Later he headed troops to give strategic chase to Kuomintang troops , liberating eastern China and many coastal islands .  After the founding of the New China , Comrade Su Yu was successively appointed deputy chief and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] .  Proceeding from the actual conditions of the army and state and the international environment , he made many major proposals to the CMC , making important contributions to building a modern defense and army .  
The pipeline will be more than 4,000 km long , running through nine provinces and autonomous regions in the western , central and eastern regions .  The total investment for its first-stage construction , including the building of some down-stream auxiliary projects , will be 120 billion yuan .  
While guiding intellectual resources to the western region , Wan Xueyuan said , we should enormously attract qualified personnel from the eastern region to participate in the economic construction and development of the western region , and also attract people from other countries , including Chinese students studying abroad and foreign experts .  
After the economically developed west , with its strong military forces , has been attacked and destroyed , Taiwan 's entire economic , political , and military systems will be in a state of chaos and paralysis , and no matter how strong the eastern defense base is , it will be unable to retrieve the war situation in the west .  
Second , as Anhui is the first stop in the industrial transference from the eastern region to the western region , we should take the initiative in receiving the radiation of the eastern region to develop our primary industry , and also spin-off projects and enterprises with certain technical content , good market prospects , and powerful pulling force to settle down in Anhui . 
India and Russia also signed 11 other agreements , including agreements on scientific and technological cooperation and on the joint exploration of petroleum and natural gas in areas off the coast of eastern India , and a memorandum of understanding on judicial cooperation .  
In the meantime , the living standards of the people in central and western regions have significantly improved ; the number of poor areas and impoverished people has continued to decrease ; and the gap between the actual incomes of urban and rural residents in eastern and western regions has somewhat narrowed .  
As the industrial structure continues to be optimized , the level of coordination and cooperation between central-western regions and the eastern part of the country will also be continuously upgraded ; the traditional mode of interaction between the resource supplying bases and processing bases will be broken down ; and all-dimension exchanges in capital , technology , human resources , and information will take place between the eastern and western regions .  
The export growth forecast for various regions in the first half of this year indicates that export in central regions grew by nearly 32 percent , exceeding the growth level of less than 28 percent in eastern regions .  The export growth rate in western regions also reached 27 percent , close to the comparable level in eastern regions .  
The development of the eastern regions has been and remains an extremely important force in supporting the overall national economy in finance , material , and technology , and is also an indispensable condition for supporting the western development and the accelerated development of central and west China .  
Politics and law departments in eastern China are urged to enhance mutual support and coordination with their western counterparts , help their counterparts strengthen material equipment building , improve their work , and help promote the simultaneous development of the political and legal work and economic construction in western regions .  
To put the large-scale western development into effect , we should also adapt our work to the requirements of instituting and perfecting a nationwide unified market system , seize the opportunity of opening to the domestic sectors , break down regional barriers , smash departmental and industrial monopoly , further open the markets , and encourage and support enterprises in the eastern and central regions to make investment and operate business in the western region .  
China 's existing economic structure is riddled with problems .  Primarily , the industrial structure ( the primary , secondary , tertiary , and within various industries ) is poor ; regional ( primarily the eastern , central , and western regions ) developments are not coordinated , and the standard of urbanization is low .  
Since the beginning of winter , there have been six major snowfalls in the eastern and central parts of Inner Mongolia . The low temperatures and accumulated snow throughout an extensive scope have become disastrous to 1.6 million people in 31 banners and counties of five leagues in the autonomous region , and a large number of domestic animals have frozen to death .  
To address the relatively tight power supply caused by Guangdong 's rapid economic development , Li Peng said : Guangdong should continue to do a good job in launching supporting projects to " bring electricity from western to eastern China , " and expedite restructuring of the electric power industry by " separating power grid management from power plant management " and by " introducing competitive prices for power distribution . "  
When referring to the economic characteristics of China 's western regions , observation team members said : Western regions ' economic structure is simpler than eastern regions ' , so it is easier to adjust .  Western regions are rich in mineral , zoological , botanical , and tourism resources .  Sichuan and Chongqing have good educational , scientific , and technological personnel .  
Shi Fenghai pointed out : It is expected that foreign capital will be concentrated first in high-profit business fields and areas - - international and domestic long-distance calls , IP telephony , Beijing , Shanghai , Guangzhou , and other important eastern areas will become the key business fields and areas which foreign capital will enter .  
For this reason , during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , we will expedite the construction of major projects of overall significance , including those aimed at bringing gas and electricity from western China to eastern China , diverting water from southern China to northern China , establishing national strategic petroleum reserves , and building a rail line into Tibet .  
Over the past year , ever since the beginning of the large-scale development of the western region , the people of the entire county have made use of this rare opportunity , laid a solid infrastructural foundation , and stepped up their cooperation with coastal areas in the country 's eastern region .  As a result , our advantage of having rich natural resources is being turned into a practical economic advantage .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : To implement the strategy for the extensive development of the west country , it not only requires plain living and hard struggle on the part of the broad ranks of cadres and masses in the west country over a long period of time , but also calls for energetic support from the people of the whole nation , especially of the eastern regions .  
The water-delivery canal for the east-line project is located in China 's eastern region where the economy is more advanced , township and town enterprises are better developed , and urbanization level is higher .  Thanks to the region 's efforts in recent several years , evident results have been attained in pollution control in the region .  However , the water samples taken from certain river sections in the region still fall below the standard of Class III required for water diversion .  
3 ) start 12 new and major projects , including the Qinghai-Tibet Railway , diverting gas from western China to eastern China , returning grain plots to forestry and grassland , and educational projects , with a total investment of 300 billion yuan ;  
There are now three options involving eastern , central , and western parts of China . The main purpose of diverting the water on the eastern and central fronts is to prevent pollution through diverting clean water to the north .  The project of diverting water on the western front can not be realized in the foreseeable future .  
It is necessary to promote development through opening up , to always persist in implement the strategy of opening to the outside world to bring along economic development , and to raise the level of our work in using resources at home and from abroad and both the international and domestic markets .  We should cater to the domestic market and seize business opportunities ; we should advance both east and west and make it possible for the eastern and western regions complement each other with their own advantages .  
County Chief Rou Zi Gu Li Ba Yi of Tashiku Erqiantajike Autonomous County said that within one year of the launching of the great strategy of developing the west , the county had strengthened cooperation with the eastern coastal region and turned ample resources into an economic advantage .  The strategy , he said , has already brought tangible benefits to the impoverished county located 4,000 meters above sea level on the Pamirs plateau that had been singled out to receive special government support .  
It is of great and far-reaching significance for narrowing the gap between the eastern and western regions in development , accelerating the process of China 's modernization drive , achieving the third-step strategic objective in the modernization of our country , promoting the unity and progress of various nationalities , realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , maintaining social stability , consolidating national defense , and achieving the lasting political stability of the country .

The background of this sheetlet depicts the Pyramid Hill in the eastern part of the New Territories . With ocherish liquidamber , violet azalea , rosy bauhinia and white camellia arranged in an impressive array , the designer chooses a colour scheme that echoes with the logo of the Exhibition . Superimposing on the picture are faint dotted lines which symbolize raindrops that nourish the plants .  
In recognition of the ecological importance of Long Valley , KCRC has carefully studied alternative alignments in addition to the gazetted alignment for the eastern end of the railway project , having regard to important factors including potential environmental impact , land use , planning requirements , engineering and operational feasibility as well as impact on local community .  
IAC is a spectacular summer arts festival featuring about 80 exciting performances from both overseas and local groups .  These performances comprise eastern and western dances , music , dramas , magic , mimes , puppet theatres and multi-media shows and will be staged between July 14 and August 27 .  
The Area is developed primarily for residential , passive recreation and conservation uses .  Low to medium density residential uses , and Government , institution and community ( GIC ) uses are concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the area .  The remaining part occupying about 65 per cent of the total area is reserved for open space and green belt uses .  
A rich galore of performing arts programmes , the Festival held between today and December 2 , showcases the traditional arts Kunqu opera and Peking opera from the north ; Cantonese opera , Chiu Chow opera and Cantonese ancient operatic singing from the south ; new theatre ventures interwoven by traditional and modern techniques ; music assimilating the eastern and western cultures ; dance ; multimedia theatre and puppet shows .  
In the Yung Long archaeological site , relics such as firing hearths , postholes , workshops for manufacturing stone tools and burials , as well as fine stone slotted rings and stone Yue ( ceremonial axe regarded as symbol of power ) imply the development of a more complex social structure and suggest that prehistoric Pearl River Delta had cultural exchanges with not just the northern and eastern part of Guangdong , but as far away as the eastern coast of China as well .  
To provide an attractive setting for civic events and land for both active and passive recreational activities , 16.6 hectares of land is zoned " Open Space " , which covers the existing open spaces and the future waterfront promenade that extends from the Central Reclamation Phase III in the west to the eastern end of the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter .  
It has been reported that the Government stated publicly some time ago that , after the implementation of the first stage of the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme , the water quality on the eastern side of Victoria Harbour had improved considerably , and the bacteria content therein had also dropped significantly to such a level that it was safe for people to swim in the water .  As such , it would actively consider resurrecting the cross-harbour swimming race that had been suspended for years in the Harbour .  
This was due largely to the development of an El Nino in the year , which was characterised by above normal sea surface temperatures in the equatorial eastern and central Pacific . The associated change in atmospheric steering flow caused tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific to turn towards the north before entering the South China Sea . 
Taiwan is surrounded by waters . The eastern coast of the island is rocky , with a sudden drop into the ocean . Its offshore waters form pathways for many species of migratory fish traveling both from the south and the north . The west coast has a gradual , inclined shelf .  
With the completion of the North Link Railroad between Suao and Hualien , a major port city at the northern end of the narrow coastal plain due to be completed by the end of this year , further development in eastern Taiwan is possible .  
In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
The Central Taiwan Vocational Training Center , the southern and northern Taiwan vocational training centers operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the Taishan vocational training center operated by the Ministry of the Interior , the first youth vocational training center run by the National Youth Commission , the northern provincial vocational training center , Taipei municipal vocational training center , eastern Taiwan vocational training center , and a vocational training center for retired servicemen .  
Looking at this list it is obvious that the foreign tourists ' knowledge of scenic spots relies on outdated information , and that recently developed scenic areas , such as the northern and eastern coasts and Orchid Island have not been sufficiently promoted abroad . This , in the end , is a great loss for the tourists themselves . "  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
This includes the establishment of centers for folk arts and popular handicrafts in southern and eastern Taiwan . In the north , Chinese culture parks will be set up . And at the same time at least five large-scale museums will be added to the present number . Exhibition halls displaying the unique features of local and indigenous products will become part and parcel of the cultural centers of every county and town .  
The majority are attracted by the numerous broad river estuaries and rich tidal marshes and mud-flats along Taiwan 's west coast , so there are far fewer migrant birds , and of fewer species , on the steeper eastern coast .  
But if cars can pass through on a new cross-island highway , people will just drive through , passing Yuli in an instant . " It 's like when the southern cross-island highway was built , " he says . " At first everyone at the eastern starting point of Haituan was vigorously in favor of opening the road , thinking that people would be able to get to Taitung in only an hour , but since then the city has been in gradual decline . "  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
This is quite different from the sandy beaches characteristic of other parts of the island . Another special feature of the eastern coast is the sharply rising coral reefs and rock platforms . There are many types of colorful channels and caves cut into the coral reefs by erosion .  
The main motive why Master Hsiao Yun , who has worked as a university professor in the past , decided to found a university was to develop students " who will truly be able to use technology to improve the human condition . " Master Cheng Yan set up the Tzu Chi nursing and medical schools to upgrade medical resources in eastern Taiwan , and to cultivate " beneficent doctors " with a spirit of compassion in an effort to help solve the problem of young girls in eastern Taiwan who have neither education nor employment .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
The year before last , Wong Ka Kue , lead singer of the Hong Kong pop group Beyond , fell from the stage while performing in Japan and thereafter remained in a coma , diagnosed as brain dead . One of the group 's fans went to seek a divination at Wong Tai Sin Temple , and got the answer : " A wild wind swept through the eastern garden last night / Tearing out all the flowers / But fortunately the gardener rose early / And replanted their roots to restore them to life . "  
Jade articles from the Liangzhu culture of Zhe-jiang Province include jade cong ( rectangular blocks with a circular hole through the middle ) carved with patterns ; huan ( discs with a large hole ) incised with images thought to depict Chi You , the eastern tribe leader slain by Huangdi ; jade bi ( ritual discs with a hole in the center ) incised with magical images , and so on .  
Take , for instance , Lai Ho , the father of Taiwan 's new literature , who started his career writing classical poems . In old age , when he was very ill , he wrote " The Setting Sun " about Japanese imperialism in its final moments : " The sun 's slanting rays yellow as west it creeps / For what place has brilliance left so soon ? / How short men 's torment in the bitter heat / Behind them rises the waxing eastern moon . "  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
This has led to land subsidence along both the eastern and western coasts . On a map of river water quality produced by the EPA , 50 of Taiwan 's major and minor rivers are colored black or brown from their mouths to their middle and upper reaches , indicating that they are heavily or moderately polluted .  
In the 1720s Burlington 's garden became something that had never been seen before . Its eastern section was in the formal classical style , with three radiating shaded avenues leading in straight lines to classical monuments . In the western part , though , Kent had created an irregular natural style , with groups of small trees and winding paths !  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
Most of Taiwan 's venomous snakes live in low-altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside . But the hundred-pace viper , which was never very numerous , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern Taiwan . It grows to one-and-a-half meters or more-much the same length as the habu and cobra-but being far thicker and meatier it is much valued by gourmands .  
Elsewhere in the ROC the traditional Han Chinese culture was southern Fujianese . Meanwhile , eastern Fujian itself has experienced such rapid develpment that almost all of its traditional architecture has been destroyed . The traditional eastern Fujianese settlements on Matsu are just about the only ones left in pristine condition anywhere in the world .  
The architecture of the temples is of the eastern Fujian style , with granite walls and featuring colorful , intricate decorations , in sharp contrast to the plain buildings around them . Squatting in the entrance of a temple on a hillside , looking out across the sea-which shines golden in the light of the setting sun and is dotted with little fishing craft-one feels a strong sense of the endless ebb and flow of history .  
Kuanshan Township is located on eastern Taiwan 's main north-south highway . The township is ringed by a 12-kilometer bicycle trail , three to four meters wide , with a concrete surface all the way . The trail is marked off with red bricks , and every 100 meters colored bricks are set in the ground in all kinds of patterns , to remind you that you have advanced another 100 meters !  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
In this issue are stories on the latest trends and options for graduate study , the changing structure of Taiwan 's population , the impact of environmental hormones , the community regeneration movement in aboriginal villages in eastern Taiwan , the legendary master of glove puppetry Huang Hai-tai , the beginning of efforts to stage Nobel Prize laureate Gao Xingjian 's Snow in August , and celebrities such as Angie Chai and Chien Wen-hsiu . Kick back , relax and read , and get a better understanding of our society , our home .  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
" Setting down roots and deepening our impact is the real hard job , " says Yu Mei-nu . To help close the gap between town and country , two years ago they began organizing women 's groups in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan to create the NUTWA , to create a platform for information and resource sharing . They are now moving to use the Internet to link women 's groups across the island .  
After the western Taiwan high-speed transportation network is established , the future will bring construction projects for eastern , central and southern Taiwan where the terrain presents even greater difficulties ; and it can be predicted that the transportation , economic and environmental challenges will be greater , so that society will have greater expectations and exert more supervision .  
" Look over there . A magnificent and auspicious blue view has appeared in the heavens . Thus embellished , that row of bare precipices from Yushan 's main summit to its eastern peak at that moment is like a rainbow , reflecting a dazzling auburn light . The creases on the mountain walls gently project a restrained cobalt blue . "  
Its towering presence is beyond the power of words to describe . Additionally , the summit provides a panoramic view of the main sources of water that nourish the land . The Nantsaihsien River and Laonung River are the sources of southern Taiwan 's Kaoping River ; the Chenyoulan River , largest tributary of central Taiwan 's Choshui River , winds its way to the northwest ; and the valley of the Lakulaku River , which feeds eastern Taiwan 's Hsiukuluan River , is also visible in the distance .  
Mt . Helan , stretching more than 250 km from south to north , is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia , the two large autonomous regions .  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China , it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current .  
This brutal aggression extended to all parts of Iraq , from the far north to the extreme south and from the remote west to the eastern boundaries .  
It should be recalled that the first phase ( five years ) of this endeavour will be the strengthening of existing regional economic communities in west , eastern , central , southern and north Africa .  
The projections of carrying capacity for eastern Kenya accounted for density patterns , agro-ecological zones , minimum farm size needed to sustain an average household each year ( calculated by considering food-crop yields and calories derived from food crops ) , total area , and cultivable area .  
A main conclusion of this study is that eastern Kenya 's limited resource base and rapid rate of population growth require comprehensive rural and regional development planning .  
The above letters contain tendentious and untrue charges concerning the alleged involvement of the Army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in incidents in the territory of eastern Slavonia contrary to the reports of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that confirmed a long time ago that the former Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) has left the United Nations Protected Areas ( UNPAs ) of the Republic of Serbian Krajina .  
Within the project on " Coastal Marine Pollution Monitoring and Training : Asia Pacific Mussel Watch " , UNU is seeking to analyse and monitor key hazardous chemicals and substances in the coastal marine areas of the Asia-Pacific region , including relative levels of important agricultural and industrial halogenated hydrocarbons in the eastern Pacific .  
The primary objectives of ECE for the biennium 1996-1997 , in response to the ongoing political and economic changes in the countries of central and eastern Europe , are the integration of these and other less developed countries in the region into the European and global economy and the consolidation of reforms .

To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr . Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , has not only failed to influence the so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs positively , but has effectively encouraged them to intensify their military option and ethnic cleansing .  
In a letter dated 14 December 1994 ( S / 1994 / 1418 ) from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 724 ( 1991 ) concerning Yugoslavia , the Council was informed of a major resurgence of diphtheria in several countries in central Asia and eastern Europe , and of the fact that the only available stocks of anti-serum to combat that serious condition were located in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) .  
Models of international trade and the experience of fast-growing developing countries also imply that in order for the transition economies of central and eastern Europe to achieve long-term growth rates significantly higher than those of the developed economies , which by now have become their major trading partners , continuous and rapid improvement will be needed in their exports . 
Building upon earlier activities and based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the coastal and marine pollution loads from land-based sources in the eastern African subregion , including the Comoros and Seychelles , the planned development of a regional overview and strategy will lead to the implementation of various additional activities , such as monitoring programmes .  
Building upon earlier activities and based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the coastal and marine pollution loads from land-based sources in the eastern African subregion , including the Comoros and Seychelles , the planned development of a regional overview and strategy will lead to the implementation of various additional activities , such as monitoring programmes .  
mandates approved by the intergovernmental bodies which had been reflected in the proposed programme budget included such important topics as the respective roles of the market and the State in economic and social development , and the continuation of economic and social reforms in central and eastern Europe .  
We are still concerned about the ongoing , complex and uncertain situation in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova and we reaffirm the necessity for an unconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops from the Transdniester region .  
It is rather incongruous that the same forces that are at the forefront of the effort to establish democratic institutions and representative governments in certain parts of the world are also engaged in an enterprise which , if successful , is calculated to destroy the free and democratic way of life in the eastern Caribbean .  
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
The information furnished contained general data on the trajectory of the planned flight of the shuttle above a specific swathe of eastern regions of the USSR and indicated the period of time during which the craft was expected to be located above the territory of the Soviet Union during its descent from orbit , its minimum flight altitude in that airspace before its entry into the Earth 's atmosphere above open sea , and technical details of the craft 's state .  
The participants in the workshop made the following recommendations , applicable to countries in central and eastern Europe : criminal law and procedure should be reviewed to determine any discriminatory provisions and effects ; consideration should be given to making rape in marriage a criminal offence ; criminal justice practitioners should be sensitized to the dynamics of domestic violence ; the police should be given specific and intensive training in crisis intervention and in the collection of evidence in domestic disputes .  
The recipients , selected among 106 nominees from Africa , Asia , Latin America and the Caribbean , eastern Europe and the CIS , focused their work on a wide range of topics , such as illegal arms and drug trafficking , money-laundering , organized crime , reform of the correctional system , juvenile delinquency , computerization of criminal justice information and crime prevention .  
Canada has reported that the five major groupings of criminal organizations operating in the country are outlaw motorcycle groups and Aboriginal , Asian , eastern European and Italian organized crime groups , while there is evidence that Colombian drug cartels and the Jamaican " posses " are also active . 
In order to support the eastern and southern regions with planned rural development projects , the Department for Priority Regions for Development was established within the State Planning Organization , and based upon certain socio-economic criteria the 28 least developed provinces were identified and included in a specific programme within the planned development projects .  
Although it is difficult to make precise statements about the contribution of the various components of domestic demand to overall growth ( because of the often large statistical discrepancies in the national accounts ) , it does appear that fixed investment is now playing an increasingly important role in the economic recovery of eastern Europe .  
Democratic and pluralistic political systems have been established ; central planning and State controls have been dismantled : prices have been liberalized , most eastern European currencies are convertible , and consumers and producers are essentially free to make decisions according to their preferences .  
The activities of FAO in support of the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe and CIS concentrate on support for the implementation of economic and institutional reforms undertaken since the early 1990s as they involve and affect the agricultural and rural sector and , through assistance in approaching sustainable development , on support for the integration of the agriculture of these countries into the world economy .  
A major study on the role and status of rural women in the central and eastern European countries is instrumental in designing a plan of action to assist rural women in the transition and constituted a part of the preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 .  
A major regional project covering 26 countries in eastern Europe and CIS was launched in 1995 and executed by ECE to assist national statistical offices in developing the human resources necessary for building self-sustainable capabilities for the collection , processing and analysis of reliable social and demographic statistics , and enabling the appropriate governmental institutions and agencies of these countries to monitor the social aspects of development .  
A positive example for landlocked countries that lie in the centre of continents is that of Switzerland and Austria , which have served as successful hosts for short-cut routes through the Alps , providing connections from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe - with notable benefits to their own economies , among the world 's most successful and richest .  
As reported at the consultation of the whole , on 18 September 1996 , at approximately 0200 hours local time , a 350-ton , 106-foot military submarine was found about 100 feet offshore , grounded in shallow water near the coastal city of Kangnung , one of the major ports on the eastern coast of the Republic of Korea .  
Whereas the current situation in eastern Zaire is purely internal , the international community can not remain aloof without seeking solutions aimed at halting the intensification of ethnic cleansing and genocide in eastern Zaire .  
Concerned about the dramatic humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire and encouraged by this statement by the Rwandan authorities , the High Commissioner is transmitting a message through the local media , reassuring the refugees that , while UNHCR would try to do everything possible to assist them where they are , the Office would be ready to help them back in Rwanda and had for that purpose increased its reception and assistance capacities inside Rwanda .  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
I have the honour to inform you that an extraordinary session of the central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution at ministerial level was held today , 11 November 1996 , at Addis Ababa to consider the current crisis in the Great Lakes region with special reference to eastern Zaire .  
The Security Council in resolution 1078 ( 1996 ) urged Member States on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the Organization of African Unity , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary orderly and secure repatriation of refugees .  
For countries like Madagascar , South-South and regional cooperation had become a necessary strategy for promoting national , regional and global development through collective autonomy , which was a basic tool for stimulating growth , technologies and accelerated development .  Madagascar was involved in the Indian Ocean Commission and had participated in the work of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) , which united the countries of eastern and southern Africa .  
Security Council resolution 1080 ( 1996 ) established a two-part mandate for the multinational force : facilitating the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organizations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire ; and facilitating the voluntary , orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons .  
After consulting with our partners in the Steering Group , Canada has now concluded that , with the return to Rwanda of the majority of refugees , the dispersal of the remaining number over large areas of eastern Zaire and the growing access of international humanitarian agencies to the remaining refugees , displaced persons and civilians at risk , the multinational force at the current authorized force level has very little utility .  
Nevertheless , the conflict that engulfed eastern Zaire and the sudden and large-scale return of Rwandans from Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania at the end of 1996 posed unprecedented challenges for UNHCR , both in terms of providing humanitarian assistance in the midst of conflict and of supporting massive reintegration in a fragile post-conflict environment .  
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 58 on this situation decided to request " the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Zaire and on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and a member of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to carry out a joint mission to investigate allegations of massacres and other issues affecting human rights which arise from the situation prevailing in eastern Zaire since September 1996 " .

Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
Given this appalling situation , we urge the international community , as represented by its specialized organizations and institutions and first and foremost by the Security Council , the International Committee of the Red Cross , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the States signatories to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , to discharge their humanitarian responsibilities and obligations by condemning these most heinous violations committed by the criminal Ethiopian Tigray forces against the civilians and soldiers who have fallen victim to the brutal aggression launched on our eastern borders .  
At his initial appearance on 31 May 1996 before Trial Chamber I , composed of Judge Jorda ( presiding ) , Judge Odio-Benito and Judge Riad , Dra _ en Erdemovi _ pleaded guilty to one count of a crime against humanity for his participation in the summary execution of approximately 1,200 unarmed civilian Muslim men at a farm near Pilica , located in the Zvornik municipality of eastern Bosnia , following the fall of Srebrenica to Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995 .  
Increasing the value added to the processing of local raw materials ; the transformation of hides and skins into exportable leather products in eight eastern and southern African countries ; the manufacture of wood products in order to provide opportunities for the environmentally sustainable development of forest resources in seven western and central African countries ; the processing of spices and aromatic products in Zanzibar ; and the introduction of new techniques for the production of salt in the Plateau State of Nigeria ;  
For decades , it has been growing dangerously worse and , as part of this process , the structural adjustment policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the countries of the southern hemisphere and in central and eastern Europe are having disastrous social consequences .  
In central and eastern Europe , where the implementation rate according to the above figures is already somewhat higher than in the other two regions under review , recent regional initiatives aim at the introduction of harmonized legal , infrastructural and logistic conditions that would allow countries in the same subregion to conduct joint controlled deliveries .  
Future activities envisaged by the resource committee on correctional systems and rights include a model seminar using the Manual for other central and eastern European States , the use of selected parts of the Manual in a seminar on prisoners rights for African participants , a joint initiative with Penal Reform International and an international symposium planned for the third quarter of 1997 .  
On the initiative of the Government of Togo , the Central Organ of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution , meeting at the ministerial level during the sixty-fifth ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of OAU , held in Tripoli from 24 to 28 February 1997 , decided to hold in Lom a special session of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Central Organ in order to consider the situation in the Great Lakes region , with particular reference to eastern Zaire .  
However , a number of security incidents have hindered humanitarian activities in the central and southern regions of the country , while difficulties continue to be experienced with the free circulation of people in the areas controlled by UNITA in the northern and eastern parts of Angola .  
While in the majority of African countries manufacturing output stagnated , strong performance was recorded for the northern and eastern subregions , with growth rates of 4.2 per cent and 5.3 per cent , respectively , sustained by strong domestic demand as well as buoyant inflows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) .  
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
While the greatest importance is often attached to imports of capital goods , it should be stressed that imports of manufactured intermediates also play a major role in the modernization of production structures , upgrading the quality of output , and generating positive spillovers to the rest of the economy . 3 The import structure of the eastern European transition economies thus appears to be consistent with efforts to restructure their economies . 
The crises of the past year or so in Albania and Bulgaria have highlighted the issues in a dramatic fashion , but many of the constituent elements of the problems in those countries - low quality of banks ' asset portfolios , " cosy relationships " between banks , state-owned enterprises and ministries , weak or non-existent regulation , and a widespread , popular mistrust of the banking system - are present in varying degrees elsewhere in eastern Europe and in the CIS .  
Nevertheless , the conflict that engulfed eastern Zaire and the sudden and large-scale return of Rwandans from Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania at the end of 1996 posed unprecedented challenges for UNHCR both in terms of providing humanitarian assistance in the midst of conflict and of supporting massive reintegration in a fragile post-conflict environment .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
With the advance of the Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo ( ADFL ) in eastern Zaire and the consequent elimination of rear bases of armed Hutu rebels close to the Burundi-Zaire border , the security situation in Burundi gradually improved during the first months of 1997 , though strong pockets of rebels remained within the former Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) near Fizi , Kalemie and Moba - enabling them to launch operations against targets in Burundi , including the Government 's military strongholds of Bururi and Makamba provinces .  
After years of living under centrally planned regimes where the private sector hardly existed as in the countries of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union most fledgling entrepreneurs lacked financial and business experience and the facilities were not available for them to start operating .  
The programme activities of UNDCP are contained in seven programmes by geographic region plus one global programme : sub-Saharan Africa ; north Africa and the Middle East ; central and eastern Europe ; west and central Asia ; south Asia ; east Asia and the Pacific ; and Latin America and the Caribbean .  
In central and eastern Europe , UNDCP will support further development of the Subregional Drug Control Cooperation Programme on the basis of the memorandum of understanding signed at Prague in 1995 , initiated to provide a comprehensive response to drug-control challenges posed by east-west and south-north illicit trafficking and growing drug abuse .  
However , the separatist authorities which were in control of the eastern part of the country continued to violate the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights of the Moldovan people .  
On behalf of the Ministry of Human Rights , I extend my sincere thanks to the national human rights organizations and eminent Congolese civilians who , at the risk of their lives , have provided the Ministry with information on serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the eastern provinces , thereby contributing to the preparation of this white paper .  
The table appended to this document is only a snapshot , giving no more than an indication , albeit a revealing one , of the blatant , deliberate and massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Rwandan , Ugandan and Burundian aggressors in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Member States in eastern Europe should be encouraged to actively cooperate and participate in the international scientific and technological research programmes on the International Space Station , as their involvement could provide major economic and social benefits for the region .  
The economic and social factors include : widespread loss of human life , destruction of social and economic infrastructure , environmental degradation , food insecurity and malnutrition _ with the additional losses caused by the floods and earthquakes which struck south _ western and north _ eastern Afghanistan in 1998 _ high levels of unemployment and poverty , and further increases in illicit drug production .  
The post-eruptive residual volcanic activity has included occasional collapse of the lava dome to generate pyroclastic flows , vigorous venting of ash and gas sometimes accompanied by small explosions and the generation of small but mobile pyroclastic flows , occasional swarms of volcano-tectonic earthquakes , and continued ground deformation on the eastern flanks of the volcano .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the document entitled " White paper on massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) and their Congolese accomplices in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo : Volume II " , covering the period from 6 November 1998 to 15 April 1999 ( see annex ) .  
In the first volume of the white paper , the Ministry of Human Rights concentrated on the massive violations of human rights and of the basic rules of international humanitarian law by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
To take note of the recommendations of the regional preparatory conferences for Africa and the Middle East , for Asia and the Pacific , for eastern Europe and for Latin America and the Caribbean that are relevant to efforts made at the global and regional levels , as set forth in sections A and B , respectively , of the annex to the present Declaration , and to call upon the international community , to the extent feasible , to consider those recommendations in appropriate forums ;  
Valuable contributions can be made to CLIVAR , the international research project derived from the study of the year-to-year variability of the tropical oceans and global atmosphere ( Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Project TOGA ) which led to the capacity to predict ENSO , by paying special attention to the measurement and understanding of ENSO characteristics in the eastern Pacific . 
The remaining objects are listed under the L category , which means that they are librating ( oscillating ) around the so-called eastern stable point at 75 degrees east longitude ( L1 category ) , western stable point at 107 degrees west longitude ( category L2 ) or even around both points ( L3 category ) . 
To welcome take note of the recommendations of the regional preparatory conferences for Africa and the Middle East , for Asia and the Pacific , for eastern Europe and for Latin America and the Caribbean that are relevant to efforts made at the global and regional levels , as set forth in sections A and B , respectively , of the annex to the present Declaration , and to call upon the international community , to the extent feasible , to implement consider those recommendations in appropriate forums ;  
This illicit and inhumane business is of a complex and transnational nature , and the wide range of organized crime that it creates is disrupting normal life in eastern Iran and adversely affecting the rest of the country .  
It is equally intolerable that the intense fighting is hindering the access of humanitarian agencies to many regions , particularly the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo , depriving vulnerable populations of the precious assistance they so sorely need .  
Urges United Nations organizations , the international community and non-governmental organizations to continue their efforts aimed at the enhanced ownership and participation of the eastern Timorese , known as Timorization , in East Timor , in the social , economic and administrative infrastructure and , in this regard , stresses the need for capacity-building , inter alia , in such areas as education , health , agriculture and rural development , the judiciary , governance and public administration , security and law and order ; .  
IRU actively promotes the adoption and practical implementation of United Nations multilateral legal instruments on road transport in central and eastern Europe , in particular in newly independent States , as well as in Asia ; support and guidance to various EU aid projects on road transport .  It contributed to the elaboration of a draft revision of the European agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport and to discussion on a draft revision of the consolidated resolution on the facilitation of road transport ;  
While the plan for the withdrawal of all foreign forces awaits completion , I am confident that continued implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the Kampala / Harare disengagement plans , further bilateral contacts and a joint commitment to address the issue of the armed groups in the eastern provinces constitute the surest way of achieving a lasting settlement and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
It has also commissioned four case studies on recent developments of transit transport systems in South-East Asia , South Asia , Latin America and southern and eastern Africa , as well as a study entitled Infrastructure development in landlocked and transit developing countries : foreign aid , private investment and the transport cost burden on landlocked developing countries .  
Powers vying for the territories of the Ottoman Empire indeed found a willing collaborator in the ultra-nationalist Armenian leadership , which , at such a historic juncture , forsook the true and lasting interests of their people , threw all the peoples of eastern Anatolia into imminent danger knowingly risking widespread communal violence in their haste to carve out an independent Armenia .  
The Missions initial objective in phase III would be to establish a mixed civilian and military presence , as well as a forward support base , in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Moreover , the civilian self-defence policy encouraged by the Government , which has enabled civilians to be trained in weapons handling , has spread to most of the northern , southern , eastern and central provinces .  
At the preoccupying situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly in the eastern parts of the country , and at the continuing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including atrocities against civilian populations , committed , often with impunity , by all parties in the conflict throughout the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , while stressing in this context that occupying forces should be held responsible for human rights violations in territory under their control , and in particular condemns :  
The severe insecurity , which seriously hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to secure access to affected populations , particularly in the zones held by armed rebels and under the control of foreign forces , while condemning the killing of six humanitarian workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 26 April 2001 in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , for which those responsible must be brought to justice ;
