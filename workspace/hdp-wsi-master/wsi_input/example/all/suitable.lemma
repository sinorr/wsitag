Extremely well suited to fresh water cultivation , Taiwan boasts one hundred such farms . A stable , warm and humid climate is available on Taiwan , as are over 40,000 fish and irrigation ponds throughout the island which are suitable for raising the fresh water mussel ( anodonta woodiana ) . Initial investment is minimal as mussels are cheap , food costs are low and little sophisticated equipment is necessary .  
Copper seals were most prevalent , while the iron seals used by high officials proved less suitable as they were subject to rust and oxidation . The so-called ' gold ' and ' silver ' seals were actually plated copper seals . Pure gold or silver was too expensive and far too soft for carving .  
As elsewhere in Taiwan , land is used to its best advantage in Chuolan . The verdant mountainsides provide a suitable and scenic setting for fruit cultivation and the area 's inherent features - - such as its excellent natural drainage - - are fully exploited by the local farmers .  
Tomatoes , both a vegetable and a fruit , command a good price in the market . Chinese cabbage and mungbean sprouts , made with green lentils , are mainstays of Chinese cuisine , while sweet potatoes , high in nutrition and needing small inputs of manpower to grow , can be a main or side dish , or an animal feed . Biologists selected the all-important soybean in part because they wished to lower its high cost and make it more suitable to Taiwan , with its limited arable land .  
During the Japanese occupation , the Japanese army surveyed the island 's mountain roads , but many of them were already long overgrown with brambles and wild grass . In addition , the paths used by the aboriginals on their hunts were not suitable for climbers , especially with the primitive equipment available to them at the time . As a result , climbing was a matter of going step by step through dense forests , and up unknown ridges , so most climbers limited themselves to familiar mountains like Yushan and Hsuehshan .  
After September of each year , the northeast seasonal winds are very strong , causing much of the soil to be blown away , and exposing the sandstone layer . In addition to the lack of humus , the soil is extremely poor and barren . Although 55 percent of the island is suitable for planting , yet due to economic inefficiency , mostly peanuts and corn are grown .  
It does n't mean that this area is ideal for the ducks - - only that suitable places are getting fewer and fewer , " Fang Wei-hung says . Kuantu used to be another major resting place for the ducks , too , but the tidewater belt there has been gradually grown over by mangroves , and the ducks have been disturbed by increased fishing boat traffic . And the number of seasonal birds that appear at Lanyang Creek near Ilan has declined over the years because of overzealous hunters and fishermen .  
But a couple of years ago such was private sector demand for experienced and well qualified personnel in the securities , banking and broadcasting industries that suitable civil servants became avidly sought after , while relatively low pay and an inflexible advancement system also contributed to the civil service brain drain .  
Local enterprises are still not very enthused about international strategic alliances , and they do n't understand them very well , " says Huang Hsiao - kuan , executive director of the business alliance group . Most American strategic alliances are games between large corporations , and transnational matchups require that " both families are of comparable standing . " Not only do both sides have to have suitable manpower , technology , and capital to be mutually attractive , they need comparable international perspectives and internationalization experience before they can really communicate .  
On the other hand , our word " alliances , " although it is very trendy , has from start to finish remained an ideal on the level of discussion only , whereas Japan 's arbitration councils are formal organizations which can be flexibly divided and united as needs dictate . Moreover , cases of successful American strategic alliances that have divided and united as they need , have mostly been between medium - and large-scale enterprises and are thus not suitable models for our domestic medium - and small-scale businesses .  
It is true that there are many experienced hawk-raisers who are dedicated to proper care of the birds , who learn from the West , collecting information and videotapes , who follow the regulations carefully , and who moreover draw a clear line being themselves and amateurs or those who are just playing around . Still , many environmental scholars point out that Taiwan is densely populated , with few resources and very little hinterland , and it is very arguable whether or not this place is suitable for hawk-raising at any level .  
One of the features of tea is that it can be made stronger or weaker . It has its own striking flavor when strong ; when it is weak , it is more like water , suitable for mixing with various flavorings like jasmine , lemon , pomegranate , or whatever .

Such is the case with Chinpao Shan 's Tsao Ji-chang , who makes his complex very clear . " Most mainlanders have a wily nature : great at talking , loving to argue but not liking hard work ; they are very suitable for thinking up ideas and moving their mouths , but their sincerity is limited . They often put profit before right , and let the boss lose out . "  
Luxe has a sixteen-year history of eel farming behind it , with the major market for that product being Japan .

Coral reefs require clear , unpolluted water in shallow seas no deeper than 30 meters , so that the symbiotic algae can absorb enough light and the coral can feed on the organisms that float by . If the water 's too hot or too cold the coral will die . Warm waters of 20-30 year round are most suitable . The salinity of the water must be above 0.25% , and so reefs can not be close to the mouth of a river .  
The people of Meinung powerfully expressed their point of view : " The site of the reservoir is only 1.5 kilometers away from Kuanghsing , and the dam is as big as fifty 100-story skyscrapers set side by side . In terms of being suitable for a reservoir , the soil which the dam would be based on is of the lowest quality . It 's soft and loose , and it wo n't hold up . And safety is a major concern . "  
At that time , yew wood was not considered suitable for making utensils . The only thing it was thought fit for was to be burnt to make charcoal . But big yews left standing in the forests were put to another use : with their well-developed root systems , they could be used as anchoring points when moving timber : steel cables would be run around them to haul together the logs from felled trees .  
Since the 1980s , when US researchers confirmed that taxol ( derived from the Pacific yew , Taxus brevifolia , which belongs to the same genus as the Taiwan yew , Taxus mairei ) is effective in treating ovarian and breast cancers , clinical trials have been conducted or are planned to test the drug against more than 60 types of tumor . As more and more suitable applications are discovered , the demand for taxol is expected only to rise .  
Before they even landed in Taiwan , Weidenhofer and Payne , who work for Artlab Australia , Down Under 's biggest restoration center , had already conducted tests on fragments Pottman had brought them , determining the composition of the paints used in the mural and finding suitable detergents . Still , they were very careful here , spending two weeks to repair just one wall of murals . In comparison to the water and soap that temples in Taiwan frequently use to clean their murals , this sort of slow and painstaking approach is extraordinary .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .

The main source of purchased ships and naval weaponry has always been the US . But the US , which has a global strategy and huge forces , has designed its ships to specialize in specific missions like air defense or ASW . For the ROC navy , which has far fewer ships and a smaller area of responsibility , highly specialized craft are not necessarily suitable . That is to say , even if Taiwan can procure US ships , it may be necessary to refit or supplement the weaponry .  
While migratory birds do follow set paths on their journeys between north and south every year , they want to end up in safe and suitable locations . Every year climatic differences and other factors will vary the " final destinations " north and south , but Huiyan Peak was not named without reason .  
" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
This exchange is the first time since the break-off of negotiations that dialogue has been conducted between the two sides .

In particular , Daoists ' choice of places to identify as fairy grottoes , apart from being suitable places to refine elixirs in the hope of transcending death , also responded to the mood of the times and to practical needs . Hence rich , fertile soil suitable for growing rice , and locations out of reach of natural disasters and human wars and turmoil , became essential requirements for the blessed abodes .  
Taiwanese has survived only because people of Fujianese ancestry are the majority in Taiwan . However , though policies designed to suppress the use of all dialects ( such as fining or hanging humiliating placards on students who spoke dialect in school , or restricting time dedicated to programming in local dialects as did the broadcasting law promulgated in 1976 ) the impression was deepened that Taiwanese was relatively crude-a " low class " language that , though perhaps more intimate , was not suitable for elegant situations .  
Why could n't a gas station be set up on the island ? The provincial government discovered that the sticking point was obtaining the land . If suitable sites were n't on national government land , then they were owned by temples . But after the provincial government negotiated with the National Property Bureau and discussed the matter with local residents , the island was finally able to get its gas station .  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
The venerable history of weiqi can be traced to the Zhou dynasty ( 1122-255 BC ) . Over the following centuries it was mentioned in many verses , songs , and popular stories .

Stroking the silver-gray ringlets which are twice as fine as human hair , Chang says that these soft , flexible fibers of high-grade steel can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but-thanks to metals ' outstanding capacity to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and their ability to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments-they also have a wide range of applications in many industries .  
At the door between the living room and dining room , there 's a tall ceramic cylinder suitable for storing scrolls , with a design that features the bright red canna blossom-a common sight in the countryside-around which bees are buzzing . Above are the words : " Busy Bees at Work . " The hardworking artist himself , who spends all day at his labors , is perhaps not unlike those bees .  
Looking to the future , as DSL and other broadband technology matures , large amounts of visual and audio information can also be transmitted through high-speed fiber-optic cable . As WAP equipment becomes widely available , you will be able to get important Internet information anywhere , condensed by transcoding technology into a form suitable for display on small devices . The open-source Linux operating system , which has appeared in the last several years , will make it easy for all types of platforms to be conveniently connected to one another .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
As tectonic forces pushed Taiwan continuously upwards and the rivers carved their way downward , such areas of collapse occurred in many places . Doughty false cypress seeds seized the opportunity to colonize this hostile territory shunned by other plants . There they gradually grew into gigantic trees , rehabilitating the land and attracting other species . At the same time they protected downstream areas , making them suitable for settlement and farming .

Its serves to provide a newly developed articulation ladder for continuing education , apart from the traditional secondary education " he said .  " Courses offered are geared to practical application , suitable for those students who could not develop fully their potentials under traditional secondary education and thus enhancing their knowledge in practical subjects and employability . "  
In anticipation of the implementation of the Mandatory Provident Fund ( MPF ) system , the Government has since mid December 1998 introduced in all new contracts and renewals suitable arrangements for the provision of end-of-contract gratuity .  The relevant provision stipulates that the contract gratuity payable to the staff plus the MPF contributions made by the Government in respect of the staff would equal to a specified percentage of the total basic salary of the substantive office drawn during the contract period .  
The society has transformed and the economy restructured with the passage of time .  While the idea of raising children as a protection for the old age is becoming out dated , the population is ageing rapidly as ever .  It is imperative that a suitable protection system should be put in place in order to provide the elderly with a reliable source of income after retirement .  
( d ) EMSD regularly provides the public , through various channels , with safety information on the proper use and selection of electrical appliances .  This includes reminding the public that in purchasing HEAs , they should select products that are designed to operate at the voltage level suitable for Hong Kong and are fitted with safe three-pin plugs .  
Apart from Sai Kung Town , the department has assessed recreational potential for the Ho Chung , High Island and Clear Water Bay clusters , both identified suitable for water sports , and the outlying islands including Kau Sai Chau , where an existing golf course is considered feasible to extend to the south . 
The Committee emphasised that interim measures were needed to enable employers , in particular multinational financial corporations , to recruit the employees that meet their corporate needs without having to resort to overseas talent or by moving their operations to alternative centres where suitable human resources were available .

After making reference to overseas experience , seeking advice from the local plumbing trade and conducting trials with successful results , the Administration decided in 2000 that dual flush devices are suitable for use in Hong Kong although such devices may have a higher capital and maintenance costs .  
For instance , to optimise the use of resources , the Immigration Department proposed a reorganisation of its regional offices , including closure of certain less cost-effective marriage registries and births and deaths registries .  This required the Government to amend the relevant subsidiary legislation and to consult those in the community affected by the closures to work out suitable arrangements so that the remaining offices could meet public demand for the services concerned .  
" In view of the heavy demand for temporary accommodation among health care staff due to various reasons , the Government has been working hard to identify suitable buildings and fitting them with basic facilities to enable our exhausted health care staff to have a decent place , as an alternative to their home , to take a well-earned rest between shifts and after duty .

Before submarine cables can be laid , tests must be conducted to decide on the most suitable route . A flat and solid sea bed , stable sea temperatures , and a lack of strong tides or currents are considered ideal conditions for cable laying . Deep trenches and geological fault lines are avoided to prevent damage .  
Extremely well suited to fresh water cultivation , Taiwan boasts one hundred such farms . A stable , warm and humid climate is available on Taiwan , as are over 40,000 fish and irrigation ponds throughout the island which are suitable for raising the fresh water mussel ( anodonta woodiana ) . Initial investment is minimal as mussels are cheap , food costs are low and little sophisticated equipment is necessary .  
Copper seals were most prevalent , while the iron seals used by high officials proved less suitable as they were subject to rust and oxidation . The so-called ' gold ' and ' silver ' seals were actually plated copper seals . Pure gold or silver was too expensive and far too soft for carving .  
As elsewhere in Taiwan , land is used to its best advantage in Chuolan . The verdant mountainsides provide a suitable and scenic setting for fruit cultivation and the area 's inherent features - - such as its excellent natural drainage - - are fully exploited by the local farmers .  
Tomatoes , both a vegetable and a fruit , command a good price in the market . Chinese cabbage and mungbean sprouts , made with green lentils , are mainstays of Chinese cuisine , while sweet potatoes , high in nutrition and needing small inputs of manpower to grow , can be a main or side dish , or an animal feed . Biologists selected the all-important soybean in part because they wished to lower its high cost and make it more suitable to Taiwan , with its limited arable land .  
During the Japanese occupation , the Japanese army surveyed the island 's mountain roads , but many of them were already long overgrown with brambles and wild grass . In addition , the paths used by the aboriginals on their hunts were not suitable for climbers , especially with the primitive equipment available to them at the time . As a result , climbing was a matter of going step by step through dense forests , and up unknown ridges , so most climbers limited themselves to familiar mountains like Yushan and Hsuehshan .  
After September of each year , the northeast seasonal winds are very strong , causing much of the soil to be blown away , and exposing the sandstone layer . In addition to the lack of humus , the soil is extremely poor and barren . Although 55 percent of the island is suitable for planting , yet due to economic inefficiency , mostly peanuts and corn are grown .  
It does n't mean that this area is ideal for the ducks - - only that suitable places are getting fewer and fewer , " Fang Wei-hung says . Kuantu used to be another major resting place for the ducks , too , but the tidewater belt there has been gradually grown over by mangroves , and the ducks have been disturbed by increased fishing boat traffic . And the number of seasonal birds that appear at Lanyang Creek near Ilan has declined over the years because of overzealous hunters and fishermen .  
But a couple of years ago such was private sector demand for experienced and well qualified personnel in the securities , banking and broadcasting industries that suitable civil servants became avidly sought after , while relatively low pay and an inflexible advancement system also contributed to the civil service brain drain .  
Local enterprises are still not very enthused about international strategic alliances , and they do n't understand them very well , " says Huang Hsiao - kuan , executive director of the business alliance group . Most American strategic alliances are games between large corporations , and transnational matchups require that " both families are of comparable standing . " Not only do both sides have to have suitable manpower , technology , and capital to be mutually attractive , they need comparable international perspectives and internationalization experience before they can really communicate .  
On the other hand , our word " alliances , " although it is very trendy , has from start to finish remained an ideal on the level of discussion only , whereas Japan 's arbitration councils are formal organizations which can be flexibly divided and united as needs dictate . Moreover , cases of successful American strategic alliances that have divided and united as they need , have mostly been between medium - and large-scale enterprises and are thus not suitable models for our domestic medium - and small-scale businesses .  
It is true that there are many experienced hawk-raisers who are dedicated to proper care of the birds , who learn from the West , collecting information and videotapes , who follow the regulations carefully , and who moreover draw a clear line being themselves and amateurs or those who are just playing around . Still , many environmental scholars point out that Taiwan is densely populated , with few resources and very little hinterland , and it is very arguable whether or not this place is suitable for hawk-raising at any level .  
One of the features of tea is that it can be made stronger or weaker . It has its own striking flavor when strong ; when it is weak , it is more like water , suitable for mixing with various flavorings like jasmine , lemon , pomegranate , or whatever . This special feature combining rich flavors with diverse selection is just the thing for the youthful desire for constant change and novelty .  
Because tribal drinking is a social activity , if a local leading figure can be enlisted to set a standard and make a start by reducing quantities to a suitable level , in a short period of time results should be evident .  
Not long ago , Taipei County executive You Ching wanted to hire Lin Yu-yi , a professor from National Normal University ( the elite teaching university ) , as director of the county Bureau of Education . The provincial government rejected him on the grounds that his qualifications were not suitable , and assigned someone else . This led to a conflict over which appointee should take office , and for a time relations between the two sides were strained .  
Such is the case with Chinpao Shan 's Tsao Ji-chang , who makes his complex very clear . " Most mainlanders have a wily nature : great at talking , loving to argue but not liking hard work ; they are very suitable for thinking up ideas and moving their mouths , but their sincerity is limited . They often put profit before right , and let the boss lose out . "  
Luxe has a sixteen-year history of eel farming behind it , with the major market for that product being Japan . It was through familiarity with Japan that the company discovered that Japanese also are very fond of moth orchids . Given the definite market there , the company decided that moth orchids were suitable for large scale commercial production .  
At that time , two Peipo women discovered by chance that when dried , the wild rushes from the wetlands where the Ta-an River flows into the sea are extremely tough and flexible and highly resistant to splitting , making them a very suitable material for making everyday utensils .  
Coral reefs require clear , unpolluted water in shallow seas no deeper than 30 meters , so that the symbiotic algae can absorb enough light and the coral can feed on the organisms that float by . If the water 's too hot or too cold the coral will die . Warm waters of 20-30 year round are most suitable . The salinity of the water must be above 0.25% , and so reefs can not be close to the mouth of a river .  
The people of Meinung powerfully expressed their point of view : " The site of the reservoir is only 1.5 kilometers away from Kuanghsing , and the dam is as big as fifty 100-story skyscrapers set side by side . In terms of being suitable for a reservoir , the soil which the dam would be based on is of the lowest quality . It 's soft and loose , and it wo n't hold up . And safety is a major concern . "  
At that time , yew wood was not considered suitable for making utensils . The only thing it was thought fit for was to be burnt to make charcoal . But big yews left standing in the forests were put to another use : with their well-developed root systems , they could be used as anchoring points when moving timber : steel cables would be run around them to haul together the logs from felled trees .  
Since the 1980s , when US researchers confirmed that taxol ( derived from the Pacific yew , Taxus brevifolia , which belongs to the same genus as the Taiwan yew , Taxus mairei ) is effective in treating ovarian and breast cancers , clinical trials have been conducted or are planned to test the drug against more than 60 types of tumor . As more and more suitable applications are discovered , the demand for taxol is expected only to rise .  
Before they even landed in Taiwan , Weidenhofer and Payne , who work for Artlab Australia , Down Under 's biggest restoration center , had already conducted tests on fragments Pottman had brought them , determining the composition of the paints used in the mural and finding suitable detergents . Still , they were very careful here , spending two weeks to repair just one wall of murals . In comparison to the water and soap that temples in Taiwan frequently use to clean their murals , this sort of slow and painstaking approach is extraordinary .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
Because problems are not readily apparent at the time gifted and talented students are selected , the National Science Council 's Science Education Office unveiled another plan three years ago for an in-depth investigation of the qualities needed by today 's gifted and talented science students . The aim was to discuss and develop suitable methods of intelligence testing to meet modern needs .  
The main source of purchased ships and naval weaponry has always been the US . But the US , which has a global strategy and huge forces , has designed its ships to specialize in specific missions like air defense or ASW . For the ROC navy , which has far fewer ships and a smaller area of responsibility , highly specialized craft are not necessarily suitable . That is to say , even if Taiwan can procure US ships , it may be necessary to refit or supplement the weaponry .  
While migratory birds do follow set paths on their journeys between north and south every year , they want to end up in safe and suitable locations . Every year climatic differences and other factors will vary the " final destinations " north and south , but Huiyan Peak was not named without reason .  
" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
This exchange is the first time since the break-off of negotiations that dialogue has been conducted between the two sides . The letter sent from Taiwan on March 5th received a quick and clear response on March 11th with ARATS reiterating that they were willing to invite representatives from the SEF of " a suitable level " to lead economic , cultural or academic missions to the PRC , either to visit or participate in seminars . The opportunity to restart cross-straits negotiations can be traced back to earlier this year .  
The pampas country of central Argentina enjoys abundant rainfall and has rich , fertile soil which can be farmed intensively without irrigation . The region is suitable for both arable farming and stock rearing , and is famous as one of the world 's granaries .  
In particular , Daoists ' choice of places to identify as fairy grottoes , apart from being suitable places to refine elixirs in the hope of transcending death , also responded to the mood of the times and to practical needs . Hence rich , fertile soil suitable for growing rice , and locations out of reach of natural disasters and human wars and turmoil , became essential requirements for the blessed abodes .  
Taiwanese has survived only because people of Fujianese ancestry are the majority in Taiwan . However , though policies designed to suppress the use of all dialects ( such as fining or hanging humiliating placards on students who spoke dialect in school , or restricting time dedicated to programming in local dialects as did the broadcasting law promulgated in 1976 ) the impression was deepened that Taiwanese was relatively crude-a " low class " language that , though perhaps more intimate , was not suitable for elegant situations .  
Why could n't a gas station be set up on the island ? The provincial government discovered that the sticking point was obtaining the land . If suitable sites were n't on national government land , then they were owned by temples . But after the provincial government negotiated with the National Property Bureau and discussed the matter with local residents , the island was finally able to get its gas station .  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
The venerable history of weiqi can be traced to the Zhou dynasty ( 1122-255 BC ) . Over the following centuries it was mentioned in many verses , songs , and popular stories . Given the official endorsement by Confucius , and its immense popularity among the literati of the Han , Wei , and Six Dynasties , it gained a reputation as an activity suitable for refined persons , and it maintained an elegant image .  
Stroking the silver-gray ringlets which are twice as fine as human hair , Chang says that these soft , flexible fibers of high-grade steel can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but-thanks to metals ' outstanding capacity to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and their ability to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments-they also have a wide range of applications in many industries .  
At the door between the living room and dining room , there 's a tall ceramic cylinder suitable for storing scrolls , with a design that features the bright red canna blossom-a common sight in the countryside-around which bees are buzzing . Above are the words : " Busy Bees at Work . " The hardworking artist himself , who spends all day at his labors , is perhaps not unlike those bees .  
Looking to the future , as DSL and other broadband technology matures , large amounts of visual and audio information can also be transmitted through high-speed fiber-optic cable . As WAP equipment becomes widely available , you will be able to get important Internet information anywhere , condensed by transcoding technology into a form suitable for display on small devices . The open-source Linux operating system , which has appeared in the last several years , will make it easy for all types of platforms to be conveniently connected to one another .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
As tectonic forces pushed Taiwan continuously upwards and the rivers carved their way downward , such areas of collapse occurred in many places . Doughty false cypress seeds seized the opportunity to colonize this hostile territory shunned by other plants . There they gradually grew into gigantic trees , rehabilitating the land and attracting other species . At the same time they protected downstream areas , making them suitable for settlement and farming .  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
Accordingly , the proposal to give temporary work to the long-term unemployed is designed to maintain their hope for future employment .

And so every year on the eve of the Lantern Festival he would volunteer to work at the local cake shop in exchange for a few sheets of uncut white paper .  
The earliest tea in Taiwan was wild tea growing in the mountains around Puli , Nantou County . A small number of Aborigines also cultivated tea for medicinal purposes , but because under theories of Chinese medicine it was considered " cold , " it was not deemed suitable as a casual drink . Large-scale cultivation of tea began only with the arrival in Taiwan of immigrants from Anxi ( Fujian ) during the Qing Dynasty .  
In his experience , eggs must be the proper shape , neither too round nor too oblong , with smooth and even contours , and creamy white like ivory in hue . The whiter the color , the more lime there is in the shell and the less calcium , resulting in a shell that is too brittle and not suitable for carving .  
But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves . As a whole , mainland writers are either concerned with popular urban lit or more focused on their own high personal expectations about their work . Few are candidates to write popular motivational books , let alone take long tours around the country to publicize these books .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste .

Alternative intellectual property rights regimes suitable for the needs of local communities that collectively possess TFRK have been proposed , taking into account the way in which traditional knowledge is acquired as the common property of a people and hence constitutes an integral and inalienable feature of its culture .  
In addition to the Central Analysis and Testing Laboratory , the Government has established the National Institute for Research into Physical and Chemical Analysis , in order to equip the country with suitable means of providing accurate information about the composition of a substance and ensuring efficient and effective control of the content of products brought into use , thus preventing the circulation of products having invisible effects on human or animal health or harmful effects on the environment , and with a view to the issue of international certificates of conformity .  
In response it was observed that , while the spirit of article 12 required expeditious consideration by the court of the enacting State of the application for recognition of the foreign proceedings , the question raised was not suitable for being addressed within the limited scope of the Model Provisions and should be left for the laws of the enacting State .  
The Inspectors ' references to such provisions as " identifying women candidates who meet the minimum qualifications for any vacant post " and measures to limit to internal circulation vacancy announcements where " fully qualified and suitable women candidates have already been identified from within the Organization or from the roster or another direct source of recruitment " are taken out of context as a demonstration of " reverse discrimination " .
