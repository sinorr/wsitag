In the process of moving from underdevelopment to prosperity , the simple , unspoilt Polynesians were not as good at business as the Chinese - - the French government helped them set up a consumer coop , but it had to shut down , while the Chinese were spread over all the islands , forming a broad commercial network that even the French themselves could n't compete with .  
At about the time the maritime powers were making links with the orient , the notion of China as a land of extraordinary riches began to spread . As one contemporary visitor reported : " This is a mighty , wealthy country , blessed with silk , gems , pearls , quicksilver , rhubarb , japonica , musk , and other treasures , in great abundance . "  
In particular , with population increasingly packed into urban areas , this creates new opportunities for communicable diseases to spread . " 2,000 Dead from Influenza : Looking back at the history of epidemic illnesses , in the era when medicines were still undeveloped and public hygiene was poor , all kinds of diseases spread by bacteria or virus posed an enormous threat to human life .  
Hsiao Min , a Christian , says that every time the passage to a new year approaches , churches will print their own red envelopes , which congregants can use at no charge . Because propitious proverbs from the Bible have been imprinted on the set , they are very popular among the congregants , so that supply ca n't keep up with demand . Since they integrate traditional customs , they can also help the evangelical church spread and adapt to local conditions . "  
A Moving Competition : Huang Chin-tsuan , who led the team to Japan , notes the vigor of Japan 's paralympic athletics program , with its organizations and centers spread out all over the country . Their volunteers are thickly distributed and knowledgeable . Huang says enviously , " Even more importantly , regular school phys-ed teachers are prepared with knowledge about the physical education needs of the handicapped , so that disabled students , under the appropriate care , can participate in phys-ed class . "  
We would probably note that the trends starting in the 1980 ' s , i.e . the loosening of trade and investment restrictions , continued as mainland China gradually opened up . Development spread from the southern coastal provinces to the North and through the interior . China was transformed , the " Sleeping Dragon " awoke , jolted from its long slumber by the calls of two of the " Little Tigers , " Hong Kong from within and Taiwan from the outside . ( edited by Teng Sue-feng / photos by Vincent Chang )  
Trying to say that a given number is either auspicious or ominous is mere superstition . Still , unlike the western sensitivity to the number 13 , Chinese have a whole philosophy built up around numbers , which is spread or experienced in real life .  
During the warm period prior to the ice age , which is to say at the same time that the Han Chinese legend of Hou Yi ( who shot down nine of the ten suns with his bow and arrow ) was said to take place , the Taiya version has it that another sun appeared in the sky . There were two suns , one above and one below , so that the distinction between day and night was lost . The weather became oppressively hot , and illnesses spread rampantly ; all living things faced extinction .  
This was due to rifts within the community on the Shankuang Estate between people who had supported different candidates in the local elections , and to people from different Ami tribes insisting on their own customs . For example , in different tribes the age at which one is eligible to take part in the male initiation ceremony varies from 15 to 19 . The spread of ages included in each age grade varies from three to five years , and there are also differences in traditional dress , and so on .  
Hoping to escape the growing vulgarization manifested in the spread of floats carrying electric organs and commercial bands playing Western music , and wanting to restore the simplicity of traditional belief , Chien Chin-hui broke away from the established way of doing things whereby everything was in the hands of the temple management committee , and instead commissioned Lin Teh-fu , director of the Ilan County Cultural Center , and Lin Mao-hsien , a scholar of folk customs , to assist in organizing the activities .  
Their function in tribal societyThere is no way to ascertain the true origin of the facial tattoos , but in the Atayals ' daily lives they did have great social meaning and function , including distinguishing tribal origin , announcing the coming of age , beautifying the appearance , preventing the spread of evil , signifying bravery and displaying the height of feminine weaving skills .  
Swatting a fly with a hammerThe ingredients for Chinese medicine are taken from the natural world , and are limited by such factors as geographical spread . Unlike the supply of Western medicine , which is determined by factory production , the supply for Chinese medicine is not stable . Supply problems for ingredients used in Chinese medicine are nothing new , but over several thousand years , numerous plants have been found to have similar effects to those in short store .  
You might see a great spread of white mushrooms growing on the withered trunk of an old dead maple , truly manifesting the idea " working even at the time of death . " It used to be that maple trees provided the best place for raising mushrooms , but sadly , in recent years the maples were almost all cut down , and they are very rare these days , so production has shifted to germ-free packaged propagation .  
But after war broke out between China and Japan , the mainland market gradually declined , and then as war spread throughout East Asia , shipping became difficult and many rushwork traders went out of business . After the war ended , things looked up economically , but then mainland China fell victim to civil war , which continued until the Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan , and the state of the rushwork trade went from bad to worse .  
But because not all fishes ' fins have the " honor " of being one of the " eight treasures , " no other fish can help sharks spread their risk . For sharks ' situation is just the opposite of other fish , whose flesh is dear but whose fins are cheap . In the past the market for shark meat was never well " developed , " and this led to the tragedy of sharks having the fins cut from their living bodies and being thrown back into the sea .  
Wen-hsiung has always been shy of strangers , but strange to say , as soon as he saw his father he would rush to hug him . Seeing an honest smile spread across his father 's simple , weathered face , Wen-hsiung feels very safe and happy .  
But although this struggle between the dragon and the tiger ended with the tiger spirit being cast down into the world of men , this was not the end of its career , for the practice of creating tiger images spread throughout the people and continued down the ages . In Chinese people 's daily lives and in their rituals , the tiger became an object of artistic appreciation , and its representation gradually developed from a ferocious beast into the cuddly , buffoonish tiger of folk art .  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
Under these conditions , " Taipei 's urban policies bent to the prevailing winds , allowing commercial activities to spread into residential areas , turning a blind eye to illegal structures , and implementing the law ' flexibly , ' " says Deng Tsung-de , also at NTU 's Building and Planning school .  
In the history of Chinese cities , fire-fighting measures were most thorough during the Song dynasty . Song cities resembled those of today 's Taiwan , with residences and places of business mixed together , streets less than fifty paces wide with alleys branching off them , buildings that rubbed up against each other , and great diversity within the population . With the city so tightly packed , fires spread quickly . This made fire fighters essential public servants .  
After burial , the mud and stones were replaced , and the cracks between the stones filled with ash from the fireplace . A straw mat was then spread on top , and the family member who buried the body would sleep on the grave for twenty days to insure that the deceased was peacefully settled in .  
Under the Japanese occupation , Taiwanese had limited access to higher education . Lien Wen-pin , now a famous doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , went to the temple to ask about his academic future shortly before he finished high school . The poem he drew read " You climbed the high mountain to study the immortals / But then came the imperial edict / When the white sun shines forever in a blue sky / If you so desire your fame will spread across the four seas . "  
TapaishaAt Green Island 's southern extremity , in the water along the coast where the depth exceeds ten meters , there are a lot of large reefs , some of which even rise above the surface of the water . From 50 to 250 meters out , you can see indications of two gigantic reefs . The reefs ' rocks have a great variety of shapes , and giant pieces of coral are spread about . If divers go into the caves , they can see many creatures seeking refuge inside .  
As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
Europeans had been fascinated with the legendary beauty of the Orient ever since Marco Polo 's diaries of the 13th century and the spread of stories about the splendor of Japan 's golden temples and religious statuary . Intrepid explorers and businessmen took their crews across the vast oceans to the mythical " golden isles " of the Far East .  
At that time the pop music market was dominated by Western recordings or by superficial Mandarin bubble-gum music . Yang 's appeal on behalf of " modern folk music " touched a deep chord with young intellectuals , and inspired many like-minded young people to create their own works . The style spread rapidly from campuses to restaurants , television , and every nook and cranny of society .  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
Afterwards , they began to perform xiang sheng in Taiwanese . The first time , the story was about a foreign preacher inviting over a Taiwanese interpreter to help him deliver a big sermon . The humor of language misunderstanding was thus unveiled . For example , " Today I 've come to preach [ bodao ] in this honorable [ gui ] place " was interpreted as , " Today I come to this ghostly [ also pronounced gui ] place to spread rice shoots [ also pronounced bodao ] . "  
Archaeologist Chang Kuang-chih argues that Tapenkeng Culture may have been an old culture spread widely in southeast coastal China . It may have been one of the two agricultural cultures that developed in parallel in China at that time , the other being the familiar Yangshao Culture which is mainly distributed around the midstream portions of the Yellow River .  
The construction of the brush 's hairs , long on the inside and short on the outside , forms a conical tip . As the brush is lifted , pressed , twirled and bent , its hairs brought close together or spread apart , the ink metamorphoses into any number of marvelous , lovely , moving lines .  
By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
In those days , because of geographical factors , northern and southern Taiwan developed distinct varieties of settlement . On the wide , flat plains of southern Taiwan , villages basically massed together . In the mountainous north , settlement was spread out among many little villages .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
These past few years , unrelentingly high housing prices and crowded public spaces have been among the ubiquitous symptoms that Taipei City , constrained as it is within a ring of mountains , is filled to bursting point . In search of a better quality of life , more and more people are moving out to the suburbs , and Taipei 's dormitory zone has spread as far as Hsinchu and Miaoli . How much private and public time and resources are consumed by their daily commute ?  
In the deep of night the flowers might be sleeping , but as every minute of spring is to be treasured like gold , why not light some candles and spread some lanterns to illuminate a night-time banquet , and pass the time in their company ?  
" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
These various musuems large and small not only pioneer new aspects of culture and enrich existing ones , they are spread across the island and are flexibly run , closing the psychological distance between museums and the public at large . They are educational and recreational resources that have become part of people 's daily lives .  
In the recent enterovirus case , public health scholars were certain that the main channel of transmission of the disease was through fecal and oral transmission . It was rarely transmitted through the air . Thus they instructed people to avoid public places , and to thoroughly wash their hands . Also , swimming pools , kindergartens , nursery schools , and other likely locations for the spread of illness were closed .  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
Take for example nasopharyngeal cancer , to which Chinese are specially susceptible . Nasopharyngeal cancer originates near the base of the skull , close to vital organs , so there 's little room for safety to make surgery more practicable . In addition , nasopharyngeal cancer is extremely likely to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or other more remote areas of the body , so it is difficult to get all of the cancer with surgery .  
There is no parallel in human history for the bronze-making culture that flourished in China over 3,000 years ago . Particularly noteworthy are the bronzes that have been unearthed at Anyang in the Yellow River basin . The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
Saying it wants to block any rampant spread of gambling , the Executive Yuan has decided to propose additional amendments in the next legislative session . However , it will certainly meet strong opposition from the conglomerates and legislators who fought so hard to have the gambling rider passed .  
With prompt action , it appears that hoof-and-mouth disease is under control . However , the Water Quality Protection Bureau of the Environmental Protection Administration warns that 24 wells were contaminated by the hasty burial of hogs which were slaughtered en masse to try to halt the spread of hoof-and-mouth disease among hogs two years ago . The EPA has warned the agencies in charge to be careful in disposing of the infected cattle which have been recently destroyed .  
And while she did grapple with the idea prior to going ahead with the shooting , the spread 's publication elicited a nearly universally positive response , enabling Yu Ke-hsin to cast off the public image as " megastar Andy Lau 's former girlfriend " that had dogged her for so long .  
Good times do n't last forever , and traditional opera was soon facing stiff competition from movies and television , while the glory days of the old venues faded out . Meanwhile the younger generation was becoming more westernized , and as multilingualism spread Fujianese opera could no longer rely on a captive audience of Minnan-only speakers . The times moved on , and with the launch in 1977 of the Singapore government 's Mandarin campaign , which included a ban on television programs in other Chinese dialects , the audience for Fujianese opera melted away .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
With a tone of deep reflection , Mulroney affirms , " Because of him , we 've come to see a beautiful home that we never noticed before , and we 've become aware that it will easily be destroyed if we are n't careful , just like in Nebraska , where tens of thousands of buffalo trod the plains as far as the eye could see , and the native Americans lived by following the buffalo herds that spread out like a sea between the earth and sky .  
Genetic engineering appears to be infinitely profitable and omnipotent . However , it is worth noting that gene transfer has risks : transferred genes can spread to unintended hosts , they can not be retracted , and they become permanent . If there is a problem , it could very well be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
Fourth , they established organized systems of religious practice . Examples are clerics such as Hui Neng , sixth patriarch of Chan Buddhism , Master Xian Shou , who founded the Huayan Sect in the Tang dynasty , and Master Zhi Zhe , who enabled the Tiantai Sect to spread far and wide . A final characteristic of the most distinctive figures in Buddhism is that their stories were avidly related by later generations .  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
Largely due to his unflagging efforts , Chinese archeology attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that enabled it to emerge as a world-class discipline . His research showed that the rise of Chinese civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around the Yellow River Valley . Rather it emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread over a vast landscape . This overturned the " single origin theory " and debunked Western assumptions about " oriental despotism . "  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
A major reason is that unsophisticated Aboriginal people of that era were often cheated and oppressed by Han Chinese , so in comparison Maxwell 's apparently selfless efforts were very much appreciated , and word spread fast to all the local tribal communities .  
" For a decade or two now , researchers in other countries have been taking notice of the boost that global warming can give to disease vectors , " says Professor Wang Chiu-sen of the graduate institute of public health at National Taiwan University . The list of diseases that may be helped to spread by climate warming includes viral diseases like dengue fever , yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis , bacterial diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , and parasitic diseases like filariasis and schistosomiasis .  
On Marshal Tiandu 's birthday , worshippers lay out a table full of offerings , including cakes , vegetables , and various items that always come in pairs : chicken , goose , fish , and pork tripe . The big spread serves as a show of esteem for the Marshal . On either side of the main offering table are two long , narrow tables laid out with birthday noodles , red eggs , and birthday peaches donated by affiliated temples and individuals .  
The recent spread of bad economic times around the globe , like the spread of a plague , can not be divorced from the changing information-era economic model . The dramatic increase in information-intensive industry , and changes in manpower demand , costs , price and market structure all influence the global economic stage .  
Three or four old buddies sit around a table munching away , feeling the satisfying warmth spread through their bodies . As the alcohol takes effect , they become happy and excitable . Amidst the noise and chatter , they feel that enormous sense of well-being that comes with crowding around a blazing fire in wintertime . It would be safe to conclude that there is no wintertime " tonic " dish more welcome and more deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture than ginger duck .  
On the same day as the medical team arrived in Vietnam , to devote as much time as possible to treating patients , in the afternoon they immediately " opened for business . " By prior arrangement , the HCM Orthodontic Hospital had spread the news of their impending arrival far and wide , and there were already 50 or 60 children with oral clefts waiting for treatment , having been brought by their anxious but hopeful parents .  
Ripple employs a concentric-ring design . The piece is shaped like a conventional water jug , with handles modeled after the curved roof gable ( ma bei ) typical of traditional Fujian-style farmhouse architecture . Yet in spite of its conventional shape , the piece exudes an aura of serenity reminiscent of an era gone by . Chang relates the impetus for this creation : " As a boy I liked to throw rocks into a roadside pond , or the well outside our house , and watch as the ripples spread out .  
As a liquid , lacquer must be spread onto some solid material . This solid material is called the base , and may be made of wood , bamboo , cloth , copper , paper , or other materials . In its original state the lacquer is highly viscous and must be thinned with camphor oil .  
It is then spread onto the base . After it dries , it is polished using moistened emery paper . Another coat of lacquer is applied and polished , and the process is repeated a dozen times or so . The lacquer can then be worked using a number of techniques , such as painting , carving , and the application of inlaid designs , before being set to dry in a dark place .  
As of May 23 , there were 538 probable SARS cases in Taiwan , and more than 60 deaths , making Taiwan the third worst affected country in the world after mainland China and Hong Kong . With the epidemic continuing to spread , and major medical centers themselves being taken out of action by the illness , how can we get back on a stable footing as quickly as possible ?  
The result of the conflict between virus and immune system is a fever , cough and other immune reactions . Thus the disease begins to spread via airborne droplets and physical contact . This occurs when one comes into contact with the oral and / or nasal secretions of the patient or with infected fecal matter and then touches the lining of one 's own mouth , eyes or nose . There are no receptors on the skin itself , so becoming infected by skin contact is unlikely .  
Many respiratory-tract infectious diseases , including Legionnaires Disease and SARS , spread quickly through closed air-conditioning systems ; extended-wear contact lenses are ideal breeding grounds for bacterial conjunctivitis ; in many cosmetic products there are bovine collagens containing mad cow disease proteins ; and " airport malaria " circles the globe on airliners .  
Taiwan has well-trained medical personnel and excellent facilities , but because it was not able to get advice and practical support from the WHO in a timely manner-for example , on preventing hospital transmission and implementing in-hospital prevention measures-much energy has been misspent and the holes created by mistakes have yet to be plugged . Vietnam , in contrast , has far fewer resources of its own compared to Taiwan , but received a great deal of WHO help and was able to rapidly control the spread of the virus .  
When dengue fever was attacking southern Taiwan , the average health center in a rural township had only five employees . But communities there are spread widely and it required a great deal of time and personnel to visit each and every community and inspect outdoor containers of standing water , destroy carrier mosquitoes , and spray disinfectant .  
The ancestors of this pint-sized member of the family Sylviidae ( the old-world warblers ) came from cold northern lands . Biogeographical evidence shows that they first spread out northeastward from the Himalayas into northern and northeastern China and Japan , and later moved south during the ice ages , reaching Taiwan via southern China or Japan .  
In early August , during Typhoon Morakot , I left Tainan Airport and sped along the freeway . A few days earlier , a viaduct was completed and opened to traffic , cutting down the travel time between the airport and the park . After just under a half-hour , I arrived at a point in between the three townships of Hsinshi , Shanhwa , and Anting . Then , all of a sudden the storm cleared , and a tremendous vista spread out before me .  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
While SARS was prevalent , the increase in stress and the resultant weakening of immune functions enabled TB to spread and develop into active cases easily . Victims who were afraid to go to hospitals to obtain medicine or who had no one to supervise the taking of medication may also have caused increases in the number the failed treatments and the incidence of drug-resistant bacterial strains . However , SARS did at least have one salutary effect-it called the medical profession 's attention to tuberculosis .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
Can you remember road workers applying a mixture of asphalt and gravel on dirt roads ? How they would spread it lightly and evenly , laying down a black carpet ? Although asphalt smells unpleasant , we love the smooth surface of asphalt roads and the comfortable rides they provide . Indeed for most of us , our impressions about asphalt are pretty much limited to roads .  
When resources were short and a good number of books were forbidden , it was the second-hand book market that helped spread knowledge , and reading was considered more important than collecting . Today there are up to 400,000 new books published a year , so why do people still want to collect old books ? " It 's because the sheer volume of books being published is huge , it 's like a sea of books out there .  
With the rise of the Internet and the digitization of audiovisual content , technologies that were originally developed for the two different forms of transmission for video and telecommunications are using digital signal convergence to enable families to enjoy the interactive pleasures of video-on-demand through set-top boxes . Looking at the world as a whole , the spread of digital content is an unmistakable trend .  
After these decorative lines are dry , they spray on a layer of yellow paint , and then add gold leaf . Before applying the gold leaf , they 've got to first apply some glue designed for that purpose : " You 've got to precisely control the time that the gold leaf glue dries , because that will affect on the quality of the gold leaf . If it 's too wet , it 's difficult to spread evenly ; if it 's too dry , it wo n't stick . "  
The formal - and often informal - privatization of public health facilities and educational institutions in response to the erosion of public funding and spread of private providers has led to rapid social differentiation in education and health .  
Today we are witnessing the emergence of a collective consciousness , the expansion of a shared system of values , an international citizenship based on common , objective interests and the spread of more uniform lifestyles .  
We regret to observe , however , that the spread of conventional arms continues to take on a dangerous magnitude , while at the same time armed conflicts are increasing , causing the tragic loss of numerous innocent human lives .  
Despite the rapid spread of contraceptive practice , unwanted births still constituted about one fourth of total fertility at the time of surveys conducted in the developing countries in the late 1980s .  
They express their growing concern over the continued spread of drug trafficking and the enormous danger it poses to social institutions , to the observance of human rights and to democratic stability in their countries .  
But as ethnic conflicts spread and political solutions become more elusive , there is a risk that humanitarian operations could become prolonged , draining limited resources and causing untold suffering .  
High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
Hungary had supported from the very beginning the idea of indefinite extension , for we are convinced that this major international instrument promotes stability by preventing the spread of the nuclear arsenal and at the same time aims at the orderly development of nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes .  
Natural resources restored , revived and protected from continuous and uncoordinated overexploitation must be managed by citizens , families and communities , who shall learn to acquire know-how , to share knowledge , to spread information , and to tap both the vast , exciting stockpile of human knowledge and their own rich national culture .  
Another main reason for this failure is that the policies of major arms-producing countries designed to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons are always short-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at securing the destructive power of their own weaponry and their own military dominance .  
Besides the fact that it continues to be the most universal and fundamental instrument for the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons , its extension demonstrated the international community 's common desire to reject all weapons of mass destruction .  
Efforts to involve men as responsible partners in helping to satisfy such needs take on a special urgency given the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS and the potential improvement in reproductive health that would follow if programmes promoted male participation as well as male methods as part of the contraceptive choices available to couples .  
Among the most acute issues were the continuing economic deterioration , the decline in real incomes , the spread of poverty , unemployment , massive migration and a sharp worsening of living standards for what appeared to be the majority of the population .  
Ensuring that due priority is given and adequate resources made available , at the national , regional and international levels , to combat the threat to individual and public health , by the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS globally , and the re-emergence of major diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria , onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) and diarrhoeal diseases , in particular , cholera ;  
There was a need to continue the search for more effective measures to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of which posed a threat to peace and international security , especially given the growing number of regional and internal conflicts .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
I have the honour to forward to you the text of a paper providing information on the activities and views of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the three underlying objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons : to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons ; to provide a sound basis for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ; and to encourage negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to disarmament .  
NPT has become a strong barrier against the spread of nuclear weapons and a standard of civilized behaviour on the part of States at the current time with the rapid structural changes occurring in the world .  
It is the Russian Federation 's firm position that the Treaty , as a major international legal document of the nuclear age ensuring an optimum balance in terms of halting the spread of nuclear weapons , nuclear disarmament and cooperation in the peaceful uses of the atom , must be extended indefinitely and unconditionally .  Such a decision by the Conference will lay the foundation for further progress in the twenty-first century towards a non-nuclear world in the future .  
To that end , the Ministers emphasized the need for concerted action in the region against the spread of extremism , which exploited the noble and sacred values of their peoples , and against arms proliferation and drug trafficking , and for swift implementation of the measures to combat those problems adopted at the meeting on regional security held at Bamako on 22 and 23 August 1994 .  16 .  The Ministers noted with concern the difficult economic situation in their countries .  
The tense situation existing there , resulting from the exacerbation of political and ethnic problems , is significantly aggravated by the uncontrolled spread of arms among civilians and refugees , which is creating a real threat to peace and stability for all the countries of the region .  
Women , who represent half of all adults newly infected with HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases , have emphasized that social vulnerability and the unequal power relationships between women and men are obstacles to safe sex , in their efforts to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases .  
Initiatives of the Group have included : the cost-sharing venture to finance a multi-sectoral AIDS study tour for concerned Cambodian government officials in Thailand ; encouragement to the Ministry of Information to take a more active and creative approach in its efforts to inform the Cambodian public ; and improving the coordination between the different United Nations agencies involved in combating the spread of the virus .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in chapter V .  
The spread of conflicts and the magnitude of the humanitarian consequences are such as to require the international community to conduct an objective and responsible evaluation and take vigorous and efficient measures to end the spiral of armed conflicts and create conditions for peace and security without which the universal realization of the right to development will be little more than a good intention . 
Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities of stemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction , bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building capabilities , advancing sustainable economic and social development , and reinforcing our joint commitment to international law and human rights ? 
This reorganization of the international system on the basis of strategic economic objectives has been accompanied by a scientific and technological revolution , a revolution of knowledge that spread across the planet and brought about the most profound change ever experienced in the history of humankind , turning the world into one large neighbourhood .  
The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States , the tragedy of refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the consequent destruction of the environment , the spread of disease , the degeneration of moral values , the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur .  
Given the proliferation of internal conflicts and regional tensions , the harmful effects of economic disorder , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the rise of crime and terrorism , violations of human rights , the ever-widening international character of drug-trafficking networks and the deterioration of the environment , there is no single area of international relations that does not require a collective effort on the part of States if it is to be mastered . 
Effective and practical solutions must be found for the serious economic , social and humanitarian problems facing African States , which have been compounded by tragedies such as civil war , the spread of epidemics and deadly diseases , desertification , refugee problems and all they entail .  
But free trade is not just helpful to developing countries , it is a global good , its benefits are spread wide , to the producers and consumers in the developed and the developing world alike , who can profit from the greater efficiency that free trade engenders , and who can buy the best and cheapest products available on the world markets .  
We need to close ranks to meet the major challenges that can face democracy , such as poverty and all it entails , the spectre of ethnic conflict , illicit drug trafficking , international terrorism , religious fanaticism , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the ravages of malaria , and so forth .  
Currently , the health of women in Rwanda was extremely vulnerable due to lack of medical infrastructure , supplies and personnel , limited financial resources , lack of access to health care , malnutrition , unsafe drinking-water , and the spread of HIV / AIDS . Women were more susceptible to diseases than men because they were overworked , had unplanned pregnancies , were malnourished during pregnancy and suffered complications from childbirth . 
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in section V .  
Action at the national level has been coupled by international efforts to promote a culture of good governance and strengthened institutions and to systematize legislative measures to prevent and control the spread of corrupt practices .  
Ensuring that due priority is given and adequate resources made available , at the national , regional and international levels , to combat the threat to individual and public health posed by the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS globally and by the re-emergence of major diseases , such as tuberculosis , malaria , onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) and diarrhoeal diseases , in particular cholera ;  
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
Scientific journals and publications dealing with technological innovation and research are slow to reach Libya , especially publications issued by specialized international organizations and agencies that are active in disseminating information and technical data relating to the spread of plant and animal diseases and epidemics in various parts of the world .  
Drug abuse has devastating social effects , including its harmful impact on youth , families , other social groups and the workplace , and adverse health consequences as well , including those resulting from the relationship between substance abuse and a number of major diseases and disorders and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) .  
One of the issues raised was the use of modern means of communication like the Internet to spread racist propaganda , and national and international steps had been proposed to deal with that problem , such as the holding of a seminar sponsored by the Office of the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , bringing together various United Nations bodies and the Internet service providers to discuss the use of the Internet in ways consistent with human rights .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Israel has continued to spread illegal settlements in the occupied territories , provoking in response deadly terrorist attacks against innocent Israeli citizens by frustrated Palestinians who see no hope in a peace process which has been in a state of prostration for more than a year .  
Yet its subsequent , rapid spread through tainted blood and heterosexual activity increased public concern , leading to actions that , if taken earlier , would have saved many lives .  
As cholera is now thought to be endemic in Somalia , agencies , having learned from four years of experience , have designed specific prevention and control plans with the local communities to ensure water chlorination and to prevent the spread of the disease through social mobilization campaigns on country-wide radio broadcasts , local billboards , flyers and messages delivered through religious leaders .  
The importance of controlling the spread of organized crime in the region and enabling the national criminal justice systems to deal with the threat was also recognized by the development of a project that would encompass two training seminars in the application of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , with a focus on extradition and organized transnational crime , for judges , prosecutors and police officers from west African States .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
It also has a negative impact on dedicated staff members who , in a genuine effort to fulfil all mandates , have to spread themselves too thinly , are unable to stay in touch with their fields of expertise and find themselves in a spiral of constant deadlines and diminishing results .  
Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
While the overall economic performance in the least developed countries has improved , poverty remains pervasive and the majority of the population in the least developed countries suffers from reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of disease and lower school enrolment .  
Urges all States to be guided in their national policies by the need to curb the testing , the production and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering ;  
The need for an integrated and intersectoral approach to health strategies has been recognized , as well as the importance of strengthening national and international efforts to prevent and combat epidemics and other diseases that are endemic in many developing countries , and in particular to address malaria and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) more effectively .  
On the question of international drug control , he said that , in the light of the unprecedented spread of illicit drugs over the past two decades , the relevant international instruments must be implemented and the role of the United Nations must be enhanced . 
In the view of the League of Arab States , far from being limited to a specific part of the world , the dangerous consequences of terrorism will spread throughout the entire world unless there is international coordination and cooperation to combat this phenomenon , which unquestionably constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination . 
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
Although national legislation on the protection of the environment has been enacted in many countries , statutory provisions dealing with the protection of the environment were mostly spread through a whole array of legislation and regulations , mainly focusing on hazardous waste , water , soil and air pollution , trafficking in endangered species of flora and fauna , noise pollution and trafficking in nuclear substances , and contained in the various laws on these issues .  
Instead , a bleak cluster of grey buildings with large underground detention cells , characterized by a stench emanating from wet blankets spread on dirty stone floors in cells meant for three , but , according to the police , accommodating up to eight at times , provides a stark contrast to the visible efforts made at creating user _ friendly environments at police stations in , for example , the central Pretoria area .  
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) has implemented HIV / AIDS prevention projects in sub-Saharan Africa , to meet the combined objectives of industrial development and the prevention of the spread of HIV / AIDS . UNIDO is supporting improved access to and affordability of products used in prevention programmes condoms , latex gloves , syringes , HIV-1 / 2 test kits through development of local manufacturing capability . 
In this connection , it is worth noting that during the fifteenth session of the Commission on Human Settlements , some delegations expressed their concern over the tendency of the Centre to spread its resources on activities that were largely tangential to its mandate and expressed the hope that the programme of work would remain focused on human settlements development as its prime objective .  
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
Specifically , operational activities at national , subregional and regional levels addressed : preventive education for high risk groups ( school children , street children ) ; prevention for intravenous drug abusers to contain the spread of HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases ; implementation of common standards for epidemiological monitoring and systems of information on drug abuse ; prevention of drug abuse in the workplace ; and training for rehabilitation and integration of former drug addicts into society , involving health and education authorities .  
They facilitate the spread of an economic model based on the principles of a market economy , while mass advertising and the global media help shape human aspirations and perceptions of social values .  
The increasing spread of the social effects of economic phenomena , coupled with the rapid advances in technology , has made the coordination of economic policies at the international level more significant than ever before .  
At both the national and international levels , institutions to promote and protect human rights economic and social , as well as civil and political have spread , and often have flourished .  
The fast spread of this new strain to neighbouring countries facing the Bay of Bengal and the quick notification of imported cases of this strain in developed countries raised global concern about a possible new pandemic of cholera .  
As a result of unchecked environmental degradation , we anticipate an increasing number of human health crises , involving the spread of infectious diseases , more cases of malnutrition and increasing health problems associated with global atmospheric change .  
The Assembly had mandated UNCTAD to undertake analysis of current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups . 
The prospects of solving those problems were diminished by the deepening of poverty , accelerated by the spread of the current global economic crisis , the shameful decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) , the growing number of humanitarian crises involving children , and the explosion of the HIV / AIDS pandemic , the devastating effects of which threatened to undermine the hard-won gains on behalf of children .  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .  
The crisis had proved difficult to manage , partly because of its rapid spread to other countries , but more importantly because the usual prescriptions had either proved ineffective or would have involved a much longer transition , which would have caused greater losses of output and social distress .  
The international community be encouraged to cooperate fully in the various efforts , at the national , regional and global levels , for the prevention of the spread of harmful aquatic organisms through ships ballast water ;  
The Office 's background investigations of targeted violence further confirmed the observations expressed in my previous report that the nature of violent activity in Kosovo , which has now spread to urban areas , has increased the number of persons who live in fear of being directly affected by violence or arbitrary treatment .  
Taking into account the growing spread of poverty and its highly negative social and political dimensions , the special session may wish to consider what kind of national , regional and international measures can be recommended in order to reverse the negative trends .  
It was reported that the average spread on new international bond issues by developing countries ( against United States Treasury bonds of comparable final maturity and coupon ) fell from 355 basis points in 1994 to 258 basis points in the first eight months of 1997 [ 15 ] .  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
Moreover , the growth of TCDC can be measured not only through the number and range of TCDC-related projects completed or ongoing but also by the spread of new TCDC configurations , including a sharp increase in country-to-country bilateral TCDC projects , the recent phenomenon of donor country involvement in triangular funding schemes , and the proliferation of partnerships among intergovernmental organizations , non-governmental organizations and other players within the multilateral system .  
Invites States , United Nations organs , programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries , in particular the least developed countries and those in Africa , in their efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV / AIDS on the human rights of their populations ;

Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country / sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Equally , the relationship between human behaviour and biomedical risks has also become more evident , exacerbated by the ease of rapid international transmission of public health and environmental health hazards , including food contamination , as seen for instance in the dramatic spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) throughout the world .  
It should be mentioned that following consultations with non-governmental organizations acting in the field of HIV / AIDS and representatives of United Nations agencies working in Romania , it was decided to set up a national multisectoral AIDS commission to examine the potential spread of AIDS and its consequences for the Romanian population and to assess the programmes developed so far with a view to working out a national strategy against this dreadful malady .  
Following the end of cold war , the United Nations has been called upon to take up new challenges and tasks as a result of the growing threat from the existence of large stockpiles of nuclear weapons , proposals for ballistic missile defences and the weaponization of outer space , the lack of progress in the field of disarmament , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the development and use of advanced and sophisticated conventional arms ;  
Broad agreement was reached on the mechanisms for cooperation in the areas stipulated in the Declaration , including regular trilateral contacts among the heads of the foreign policy and other interested departments , and joint consultations at various levels , in particular with a view to counteracting the spread of aggressive religious and other extremism and combating terrorism , transnational organized crime and illicit traffic in drugs and arms .  
The objectives of the joint action are : ( a ) to combat and contribute to ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons ; ( b ) to contribute to the reduction of existing accumulations of these weapons to levels consistent with the legitimate security needs of countries ; and ( c ) to help those regions suffering from the problems associated with excessive accumulation and spread of small arms to tackle them .  
Canada believes that the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons ( hereinafter referred to as small arms ) have now been widely recognized as an important issue affecting international as well as human security , one that demands urgent action .  
When the shell hits its target , normally a tank or an armoured car , it emits chemical and radioactive dust containing carcinogenic ionized atoms ( alpha-gamma ) that not only contaminates the area around the incinerated tank but is carried great distances on the wind and spread over a wide area , contaminating the air , soil , vegetation and human beings .  
The growing openness of some economies made them more vulnerable to adverse external effects and promoted the spread of local economic troubles to other regions of the world , as the recent financial crisis in Asia had demonstrated .  
Also concerned about the close link between terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , on the one hand , and the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons , on the other , and stressing the importance of international efforts aimed at combating them , Also welcoming the report of the Secretary-General on small arms , 101 prepared with the assistance of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms pursuant to General Assembly resolution 52 / 38 J ,  
Ms . Viotti ( Brazil ) said that ethnic cleansing , the resurgence of false doctrines of racial superiority , the trend towards restricting the rights of migrant workers , the use of new technologies to spread intolerance and the abuses committed against asylum-seekers and refugees were just some of the obstacles which the international community must overcome to keep alive the spirit that had inspired the historic struggle to put an end to racism .  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts , in order to promote international financial stability , and to this end to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Therefore criminal groups spread into sectors where the risk of being arrested and heavily sentenced is relatively low , especially compared to the attractive economic return . 15 Responses are advocated that may reduce such normative inconsistencies while reducing the mobility of transnational organized groups . 
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts to promote international financial stability and , to this end , to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crises in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
This has now changed to a vicious circle of depressed exports which discouraged investment , and vice versa ; the depression spread over the region and dampened exports which , together with low consumption resulting from uncertain economic prospects decreased aggregate demand and discouraged investment for the future .  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
As the Secretary-General suggests , changing international circumstances including the spread of notions of individual rights and the idea that the international community has a responsibility to respond effectively to humanitarian crises are challenging traditional notions of national sovereignty .  
Having recognized the value of open economies , we should , however , be ready to address emerging population problems such as increasing migration including transit migration , outflow of the most productive young strata of society from the less developed economies to the more prosperous ones , drug trafficking and the spread of AIDS and other dangerous diseases , to name but a few .  
In moving towards a world in which the benefits of scientific and technological change are spread more widely across society , public and private institutions will increasingly be called upon to motivate and interact with a larger and more diverse number of actors than in the past , for the process of innovation is interactive and system-wide .  
However , the efforts to spread basic education in rural areas are hampered by a number of constraints of a geographical , economic and cultural nature ( absence of means of communication , scattered habitations , mountainous areas in certain regions , etc . ) .  
Since 1994 , ICEPS has helped to spread information on the main activities implemented and planned by the Economic and Social Council , and , in general , by the United Nations system among actors with which ICEPS maintains regular relations and among institutions interested , at the national level , in United Nations activities but without access to adequate and updated means of information .  
Nigeria accounts for 25 per cent of the global spread of AIDS in 1998 , with over half a-million new infections ; yet , efforts to educate the public about AIDS prevention and management are insufficient . 8 The health needs of special or particular groups such as pregnant women , the aged and the disabled , are also neglected . 
Not only does the use of arms complicate the search for a peaceful resolution of differences , but it is also a source of much human suffering : the displacement of populations , the destruction of socio-economic infrastructures acquired at the cost of great efforts , massive flows of refugees into bordering countries and the sudden spread of disease.This list is not an exhaustive one by any means . 
One such seminar , to be held in Geneva in January 2000 under the auspices of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , would consider penal , civil and administrative remedies for victims of racist acts and would also discuss sound practices used by governmental and non-governmental bodies to assist such victims as well as methods employed such as mediation , conciliation and preventing the spread of racism .  
On the one hand , we have witnessed of amazing scientific , technological and material progress , the spread of human rights and democracy and the development of universal international institutions .  
These include local and regional armed conflicts , growing indebtedness , rampant poverty , scarcity of financial resources , and the spread of dangerous diseases such as HIV / AIDS and malaria .  
How can we spread the implementation of human rights across the globe so that the practice of rights economic , social and cultural , and civil and political can foster cultures of respect and tolerance , in the framework of fundamental human rights ?  
The Special Rapporteur asks for urgent national and international action at all levels to combat extreme poverty and social exclusion , whose spread may lead to continued instability that could weaken the peace process and impede peaceful coexistence .  
They pledged to make new efforts aimed at the total elimination of nuclear arsenals , halting the global spread of nuclear weapons and strengthening the essential standards governing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
It justly identified deepening poverty and inequality , proliferating conflict , the deadly spread of the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) and continuing discrimination , particularly against women and girls , as formidable challenges in developing future actions for children .  
Also express our concern in this regard that external interference , mainly linked to the exploitation of minerals and the arms trade , an unfavourable international economic environment and foreign debt , are the main contributing factors in the spread of conflicts and instability in Africa ;  
Deeply concerned that , 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Deeply concerned that , 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
A central challenge is to ensure a stable , predictable , non-discriminatory , transparent , fair and equitable multilateral trading system in support of development , which contributes in a coherent manner to spread the benefits of trade to all developing countries , ensuring rapid and sustained growth of incomes and exports to finance their development goals .  
Recognize that education and lifelong learning are basic for the respect of the racial , ethnic , cultural , linguistic and religious diversity of our societies which is essential to prevent the spread of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and is of key importance for protecting and promoting democratic values ;  
The suffering of large numbers of children especially infants and nursing mothers from lack of primary health care , basic health services and malnutrition or unbalanced diets , lack of clean drinking water and proper sanitation , especially in rural and desert areas , poor districts and refugee camps , increased hazards of environmental pollution , dangers of the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and lack of care provided to children with special needs ;  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
Greater awareness is also needed of global negatives illicit drugs , transnational crime , tobacco and of ways in which globalization is fostering them , leading to a more effective integration of the policy and regulatory framework required to address them into the overall actions being promoted to spread and maximize the potential benefits of globalization .  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
This dire prognosis is based on the analysis of the current epidemiological situation in Georgia and neighbouring countries , all of which are experiencing widespread drug abuse , increased migration , and lack of disposable medical instruments and diagnostic test systems , among other factors .  Currently , Georgia is still within the so-called window of opportunity for preventing the massive spread of HIV / AIDS .  
By 2003 , establish national prevention targets , recognizing and addressing factors leading to the spread of the epidemic and increasing peoples vulnerability , to reduce HIV incidence for those identifiable groups , within particular local contexts , which currently have high or increasing rates of HIV infection , or which available public health information indicates are at the highest risk for new infection ;  
By 2003 , have in place national strategies to address the spread of HIV among national uniformed services , where this is required , including armed forces and civil defence force and consider ways of using personnel from these services who are educated and trained in HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention to assist with HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention activities including participation in emergency , humanitarian , disaster relief and rehabilitation assistance ;  
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
We note with regret that certain media circles , by promoting false images , particularly of migrant workers and refugees , have contributed to the spread of xenophobic sentiments among the public and have encouraged violence by racist groups ; 96 .  We recognize the positive contribution the exercise of the right to freedom of expression ,  
Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
It is easy to see that we are dealing with an act devoid of any military objective whose sole aim was simply to spread death , suffering and destruction of our people in the most atrocious way .  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
The manifestations of that daily horror are daily massacres of the civilian population , summary and extrajudicial executions , the deportation of entire populations , the taking of hostages , hijacking , the illegal capture and destruction of aircraft , the systematic rape and burying alive of women , destitution , other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , the deliberate and criminal spread of HIV / AIDS , and so forth .  
He expressed the hope that the outcomes of the Fourth World Tourism Organization Ministerial Conference and the World Summit on Sustainable Development could provide help to developing countries in their efforts , inter alia , to feed the poor and provide shelter ; halt and reverse the spread of HIV / AIDS ; provide safe drinking water ; and offer employment to the millions of unemployed youth .  
The participants acknowledged that the spread of internal conflicts requires enhanced international and regional cooperation to tackle their root causes and committed themselves to improving coordination of their efforts in the fields of preventive action and peace-building .  
Moreover , the civilian self-defence policy encouraged by the Government , which has enabled civilians to be trained in weapons handling , has spread to most of the northern , southern , eastern and central provinces .  
Notwithstanding the fresh hopes for a safer environment brought about by the end of the cold war , the world has experienced a proliferation of regional conflicts and armed hostilities , and has witnessed a trend towards the spread and destabilizing accumulation of sophisticated weapons systems , including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
Impacts of global warming include an accelerated rise in sea levels , increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events , changes in patterns and levels of precipitation , the drying of arid and semi-arid areas from decreased precipitation , and the spread of vector borne diseases .  
In addition , pursuant to Security Council resolution 1308 ( 2000 ) of 17 July 2000 , and in the light of the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection among the population of Sierra Leone as well as among the Missions military and civilian personnel , it is proposed that a post for an HIV / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) policy officer be established at the P-4 level .

A thick layer of course salt is first spread over a two-foot square of gauze , onto which is placed a 2-3 kilogram half of a chicken . The gauze is then sewn up around the chicken , which is placed in a large pot and slowly roasted over glowing coals .  
The premier stated that the Taiwan region has a prosperous society and a well-to-do way of life , but that owing to rapid economic growth , the increase of the population , and the swift spread of urbanization , the environmental protection measures and the related public infrastructure of the area have been hard put to remain adequate to the needs of the times .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
The cherry tree has already grown leaves under the heat of the scorching sun . The strong life is lifted high into the air in distinct stages . The result is just as I thought it would be . The tree is not the least bit shy or timid - - even so as to spread in every direction .  
The United States at the time suspected that the international spread of Japanese encephalitis was related to animal migration and asked thirteen countries in Southeast Asia , including the R . O . C . , to take part in a pathological survey of migratory animals , the main focus of which was birds .  
Numerous disorderly phenomena have cropped up , such as a deterioration in public safety caused by the spread of guns . The problem of parliamentary turnover , polarization of views on the issue of Taiwan independence vs . reunification with China , real estate and stock speculation , shortcomings in social welfare , and labor and environmental problems all need to be addressed .  
Several of the most popular areas of research , such as the encroachment of Western imperialism on China , Christianity in China , Chinese political philosophy and the spread of education were all aimed at gaining a quick understanding of modern China , and areas not related to contemporary China were neglected .  
In the process of moving from underdevelopment to prosperity , the simple , unspoilt Polynesians were not as good at business as the Chinese - - the French government helped them set up a consumer coop , but it had to shut down , while the Chinese were spread over all the islands , forming a broad commercial network that even the French themselves could n't compete with .  
At about the time the maritime powers were making links with the orient , the notion of China as a land of extraordinary riches began to spread . As one contemporary visitor reported : " This is a mighty , wealthy country , blessed with silk , gems , pearls , quicksilver , rhubarb , japonica , musk , and other treasures , in great abundance . "  
In particular , with population increasingly packed into urban areas , this creates new opportunities for communicable diseases to spread . " 2,000 Dead from Influenza : Looking back at the history of epidemic illnesses , in the era when medicines were still undeveloped and public hygiene was poor , all kinds of diseases spread by bacteria or virus posed an enormous threat to human life .  
Hsiao Min , a Christian , says that every time the passage to a new year approaches , churches will print their own red envelopes , which congregants can use at no charge . Because propitious proverbs from the Bible have been imprinted on the set , they are very popular among the congregants , so that supply ca n't keep up with demand . Since they integrate traditional customs , they can also help the evangelical church spread and adapt to local conditions . "  
A Moving Competition : Huang Chin-tsuan , who led the team to Japan , notes the vigor of Japan 's paralympic athletics program , with its organizations and centers spread out all over the country . Their volunteers are thickly distributed and knowledgeable . Huang says enviously , " Even more importantly , regular school phys-ed teachers are prepared with knowledge about the physical education needs of the handicapped , so that disabled students , under the appropriate care , can participate in phys-ed class . "  
We would probably note that the trends starting in the 1980 ' s , i.e . the loosening of trade and investment restrictions , continued as mainland China gradually opened up . Development spread from the southern coastal provinces to the North and through the interior . China was transformed , the " Sleeping Dragon " awoke , jolted from its long slumber by the calls of two of the " Little Tigers , " Hong Kong from within and Taiwan from the outside . ( edited by Teng Sue-feng / photos by Vincent Chang )  
Trying to say that a given number is either auspicious or ominous is mere superstition . Still , unlike the western sensitivity to the number 13 , Chinese have a whole philosophy built up around numbers , which is spread or experienced in real life .  
During the warm period prior to the ice age , which is to say at the same time that the Han Chinese legend of Hou Yi ( who shot down nine of the ten suns with his bow and arrow ) was said to take place , the Taiya version has it that another sun appeared in the sky . There were two suns , one above and one below , so that the distinction between day and night was lost . The weather became oppressively hot , and illnesses spread rampantly ; all living things faced extinction .  
This was due to rifts within the community on the Shankuang Estate between people who had supported different candidates in the local elections , and to people from different Ami tribes insisting on their own customs . For example , in different tribes the age at which one is eligible to take part in the male initiation ceremony varies from 15 to 19 . The spread of ages included in each age grade varies from three to five years , and there are also differences in traditional dress , and so on .  
Hoping to escape the growing vulgarization manifested in the spread of floats carrying electric organs and commercial bands playing Western music , and wanting to restore the simplicity of traditional belief , Chien Chin-hui broke away from the established way of doing things whereby everything was in the hands of the temple management committee , and instead commissioned Lin Teh-fu , director of the Ilan County Cultural Center , and Lin Mao-hsien , a scholar of folk customs , to assist in organizing the activities .  
Their function in tribal societyThere is no way to ascertain the true origin of the facial tattoos , but in the Atayals ' daily lives they did have great social meaning and function , including distinguishing tribal origin , announcing the coming of age , beautifying the appearance , preventing the spread of evil , signifying bravery and displaying the height of feminine weaving skills .  
Swatting a fly with a hammerThe ingredients for Chinese medicine are taken from the natural world , and are limited by such factors as geographical spread . Unlike the supply of Western medicine , which is determined by factory production , the supply for Chinese medicine is not stable . Supply problems for ingredients used in Chinese medicine are nothing new , but over several thousand years , numerous plants have been found to have similar effects to those in short store .  
You might see a great spread of white mushrooms growing on the withered trunk of an old dead maple , truly manifesting the idea " working even at the time of death . " It used to be that maple trees provided the best place for raising mushrooms , but sadly , in recent years the maples were almost all cut down , and they are very rare these days , so production has shifted to germ-free packaged propagation .  
But after war broke out between China and Japan , the mainland market gradually declined , and then as war spread throughout East Asia , shipping became difficult and many rushwork traders went out of business . After the war ended , things looked up economically , but then mainland China fell victim to civil war , which continued until the Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan , and the state of the rushwork trade went from bad to worse .  
But because not all fishes ' fins have the " honor " of being one of the " eight treasures , " no other fish can help sharks spread their risk . For sharks ' situation is just the opposite of other fish , whose flesh is dear but whose fins are cheap . In the past the market for shark meat was never well " developed , " and this led to the tragedy of sharks having the fins cut from their living bodies and being thrown back into the sea .  
Wen-hsiung has always been shy of strangers , but strange to say , as soon as he saw his father he would rush to hug him . Seeing an honest smile spread across his father 's simple , weathered face , Wen-hsiung feels very safe and happy .  
But although this struggle between the dragon and the tiger ended with the tiger spirit being cast down into the world of men , this was not the end of its career , for the practice of creating tiger images spread throughout the people and continued down the ages . In Chinese people 's daily lives and in their rituals , the tiger became an object of artistic appreciation , and its representation gradually developed from a ferocious beast into the cuddly , buffoonish tiger of folk art .  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
Under these conditions , " Taipei 's urban policies bent to the prevailing winds , allowing commercial activities to spread into residential areas , turning a blind eye to illegal structures , and implementing the law ' flexibly , ' " says Deng Tsung-de , also at NTU 's Building and Planning school .  
In the history of Chinese cities , fire-fighting measures were most thorough during the Song dynasty . Song cities resembled those of today 's Taiwan , with residences and places of business mixed together , streets less than fifty paces wide with alleys branching off them , buildings that rubbed up against each other , and great diversity within the population . With the city so tightly packed , fires spread quickly . This made fire fighters essential public servants .  
After burial , the mud and stones were replaced , and the cracks between the stones filled with ash from the fireplace . A straw mat was then spread on top , and the family member who buried the body would sleep on the grave for twenty days to insure that the deceased was peacefully settled in .  
Under the Japanese occupation , Taiwanese had limited access to higher education . Lien Wen-pin , now a famous doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , went to the temple to ask about his academic future shortly before he finished high school . The poem he drew read " You climbed the high mountain to study the immortals / But then came the imperial edict / When the white sun shines forever in a blue sky / If you so desire your fame will spread across the four seas . "  
TapaishaAt Green Island 's southern extremity , in the water along the coast where the depth exceeds ten meters , there are a lot of large reefs , some of which even rise above the surface of the water . From 50 to 250 meters out , you can see indications of two gigantic reefs . The reefs ' rocks have a great variety of shapes , and giant pieces of coral are spread about . If divers go into the caves , they can see many creatures seeking refuge inside .  
As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
Europeans had been fascinated with the legendary beauty of the Orient ever since Marco Polo 's diaries of the 13th century and the spread of stories about the splendor of Japan 's golden temples and religious statuary . Intrepid explorers and businessmen took their crews across the vast oceans to the mythical " golden isles " of the Far East .  
At that time the pop music market was dominated by Western recordings or by superficial Mandarin bubble-gum music . Yang 's appeal on behalf of " modern folk music " touched a deep chord with young intellectuals , and inspired many like-minded young people to create their own works . The style spread rapidly from campuses to restaurants , television , and every nook and cranny of society .  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
Afterwards , they began to perform xiang sheng in Taiwanese . The first time , the story was about a foreign preacher inviting over a Taiwanese interpreter to help him deliver a big sermon . The humor of language misunderstanding was thus unveiled . For example , " Today I 've come to preach [ bodao ] in this honorable [ gui ] place " was interpreted as , " Today I come to this ghostly [ also pronounced gui ] place to spread rice shoots [ also pronounced bodao ] . "  
Archaeologist Chang Kuang-chih argues that Tapenkeng Culture may have been an old culture spread widely in southeast coastal China . It may have been one of the two agricultural cultures that developed in parallel in China at that time , the other being the familiar Yangshao Culture which is mainly distributed around the midstream portions of the Yellow River .  
The construction of the brush 's hairs , long on the inside and short on the outside , forms a conical tip . As the brush is lifted , pressed , twirled and bent , its hairs brought close together or spread apart , the ink metamorphoses into any number of marvelous , lovely , moving lines .  
By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
In those days , because of geographical factors , northern and southern Taiwan developed distinct varieties of settlement . On the wide , flat plains of southern Taiwan , villages basically massed together . In the mountainous north , settlement was spread out among many little villages .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
These past few years , unrelentingly high housing prices and crowded public spaces have been among the ubiquitous symptoms that Taipei City , constrained as it is within a ring of mountains , is filled to bursting point . In search of a better quality of life , more and more people are moving out to the suburbs , and Taipei 's dormitory zone has spread as far as Hsinchu and Miaoli . How much private and public time and resources are consumed by their daily commute ?  
In the deep of night the flowers might be sleeping , but as every minute of spring is to be treasured like gold , why not light some candles and spread some lanterns to illuminate a night-time banquet , and pass the time in their company ?  
" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
These various musuems large and small not only pioneer new aspects of culture and enrich existing ones , they are spread across the island and are flexibly run , closing the psychological distance between museums and the public at large . They are educational and recreational resources that have become part of people 's daily lives .  
In the recent enterovirus case , public health scholars were certain that the main channel of transmission of the disease was through fecal and oral transmission . It was rarely transmitted through the air . Thus they instructed people to avoid public places , and to thoroughly wash their hands . Also , swimming pools , kindergartens , nursery schools , and other likely locations for the spread of illness were closed .  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
Take for example nasopharyngeal cancer , to which Chinese are specially susceptible . Nasopharyngeal cancer originates near the base of the skull , close to vital organs , so there 's little room for safety to make surgery more practicable . In addition , nasopharyngeal cancer is extremely likely to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or other more remote areas of the body , so it is difficult to get all of the cancer with surgery .  
There is no parallel in human history for the bronze-making culture that flourished in China over 3,000 years ago . Particularly noteworthy are the bronzes that have been unearthed at Anyang in the Yellow River basin . The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
Saying it wants to block any rampant spread of gambling , the Executive Yuan has decided to propose additional amendments in the next legislative session . However , it will certainly meet strong opposition from the conglomerates and legislators who fought so hard to have the gambling rider passed .  
With prompt action , it appears that hoof-and-mouth disease is under control . However , the Water Quality Protection Bureau of the Environmental Protection Administration warns that 24 wells were contaminated by the hasty burial of hogs which were slaughtered en masse to try to halt the spread of hoof-and-mouth disease among hogs two years ago . The EPA has warned the agencies in charge to be careful in disposing of the infected cattle which have been recently destroyed .  
And while she did grapple with the idea prior to going ahead with the shooting , the spread 's publication elicited a nearly universally positive response , enabling Yu Ke-hsin to cast off the public image as " megastar Andy Lau 's former girlfriend " that had dogged her for so long .  
Good times do n't last forever , and traditional opera was soon facing stiff competition from movies and television , while the glory days of the old venues faded out . Meanwhile the younger generation was becoming more westernized , and as multilingualism spread Fujianese opera could no longer rely on a captive audience of Minnan-only speakers . The times moved on , and with the launch in 1977 of the Singapore government 's Mandarin campaign , which included a ban on television programs in other Chinese dialects , the audience for Fujianese opera melted away .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
With a tone of deep reflection , Mulroney affirms , " Because of him , we 've come to see a beautiful home that we never noticed before , and we 've become aware that it will easily be destroyed if we are n't careful , just like in Nebraska , where tens of thousands of buffalo trod the plains as far as the eye could see , and the native Americans lived by following the buffalo herds that spread out like a sea between the earth and sky .  
Genetic engineering appears to be infinitely profitable and omnipotent . However , it is worth noting that gene transfer has risks : transferred genes can spread to unintended hosts , they can not be retracted , and they become permanent . If there is a problem , it could very well be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
Fourth , they established organized systems of religious practice . Examples are clerics such as Hui Neng , sixth patriarch of Chan Buddhism , Master Xian Shou , who founded the Huayan Sect in the Tang dynasty , and Master Zhi Zhe , who enabled the Tiantai Sect to spread far and wide . A final characteristic of the most distinctive figures in Buddhism is that their stories were avidly related by later generations .  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
Largely due to his unflagging efforts , Chinese archeology attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that enabled it to emerge as a world-class discipline . His research showed that the rise of Chinese civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around the Yellow River Valley . Rather it emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread over a vast landscape . This overturned the " single origin theory " and debunked Western assumptions about " oriental despotism . "  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
A major reason is that unsophisticated Aboriginal people of that era were often cheated and oppressed by Han Chinese , so in comparison Maxwell 's apparently selfless efforts were very much appreciated , and word spread fast to all the local tribal communities .  
" For a decade or two now , researchers in other countries have been taking notice of the boost that global warming can give to disease vectors , " says Professor Wang Chiu-sen of the graduate institute of public health at National Taiwan University . The list of diseases that may be helped to spread by climate warming includes viral diseases like dengue fever , yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis , bacterial diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , and parasitic diseases like filariasis and schistosomiasis .  
On Marshal Tiandu 's birthday , worshippers lay out a table full of offerings , including cakes , vegetables , and various items that always come in pairs : chicken , goose , fish , and pork tripe . The big spread serves as a show of esteem for the Marshal . On either side of the main offering table are two long , narrow tables laid out with birthday noodles , red eggs , and birthday peaches donated by affiliated temples and individuals .  
The recent spread of bad economic times around the globe , like the spread of a plague , can not be divorced from the changing information-era economic model . The dramatic increase in information-intensive industry , and changes in manpower demand , costs , price and market structure all influence the global economic stage .  
Three or four old buddies sit around a table munching away , feeling the satisfying warmth spread through their bodies . As the alcohol takes effect , they become happy and excitable . Amidst the noise and chatter , they feel that enormous sense of well-being that comes with crowding around a blazing fire in wintertime . It would be safe to conclude that there is no wintertime " tonic " dish more welcome and more deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture than ginger duck .  
On the same day as the medical team arrived in Vietnam , to devote as much time as possible to treating patients , in the afternoon they immediately " opened for business . " By prior arrangement , the HCM Orthodontic Hospital had spread the news of their impending arrival far and wide , and there were already 50 or 60 children with oral clefts waiting for treatment , having been brought by their anxious but hopeful parents .  
Ripple employs a concentric-ring design . The piece is shaped like a conventional water jug , with handles modeled after the curved roof gable ( ma bei ) typical of traditional Fujian-style farmhouse architecture . Yet in spite of its conventional shape , the piece exudes an aura of serenity reminiscent of an era gone by . Chang relates the impetus for this creation : " As a boy I liked to throw rocks into a roadside pond , or the well outside our house , and watch as the ripples spread out .  
As a liquid , lacquer must be spread onto some solid material . This solid material is called the base , and may be made of wood , bamboo , cloth , copper , paper , or other materials . In its original state the lacquer is highly viscous and must be thinned with camphor oil .  
It is then spread onto the base . After it dries , it is polished using moistened emery paper . Another coat of lacquer is applied and polished , and the process is repeated a dozen times or so . The lacquer can then be worked using a number of techniques , such as painting , carving , and the application of inlaid designs , before being set to dry in a dark place .  
As of May 23 , there were 538 probable SARS cases in Taiwan , and more than 60 deaths , making Taiwan the third worst affected country in the world after mainland China and Hong Kong . With the epidemic continuing to spread , and major medical centers themselves being taken out of action by the illness , how can we get back on a stable footing as quickly as possible ?  
The result of the conflict between virus and immune system is a fever , cough and other immune reactions . Thus the disease begins to spread via airborne droplets and physical contact . This occurs when one comes into contact with the oral and / or nasal secretions of the patient or with infected fecal matter and then touches the lining of one 's own mouth , eyes or nose . There are no receptors on the skin itself , so becoming infected by skin contact is unlikely .  
Many respiratory-tract infectious diseases , including Legionnaires Disease and SARS , spread quickly through closed air-conditioning systems ; extended-wear contact lenses are ideal breeding grounds for bacterial conjunctivitis ; in many cosmetic products there are bovine collagens containing mad cow disease proteins ; and " airport malaria " circles the globe on airliners .  
Taiwan has well-trained medical personnel and excellent facilities , but because it was not able to get advice and practical support from the WHO in a timely manner-for example , on preventing hospital transmission and implementing in-hospital prevention measures-much energy has been misspent and the holes created by mistakes have yet to be plugged . Vietnam , in contrast , has far fewer resources of its own compared to Taiwan , but received a great deal of WHO help and was able to rapidly control the spread of the virus .  
When dengue fever was attacking southern Taiwan , the average health center in a rural township had only five employees . But communities there are spread widely and it required a great deal of time and personnel to visit each and every community and inspect outdoor containers of standing water , destroy carrier mosquitoes , and spray disinfectant .  
The ancestors of this pint-sized member of the family Sylviidae ( the old-world warblers ) came from cold northern lands . Biogeographical evidence shows that they first spread out northeastward from the Himalayas into northern and northeastern China and Japan , and later moved south during the ice ages , reaching Taiwan via southern China or Japan .  
In early August , during Typhoon Morakot , I left Tainan Airport and sped along the freeway . A few days earlier , a viaduct was completed and opened to traffic , cutting down the travel time between the airport and the park . After just under a half-hour , I arrived at a point in between the three townships of Hsinshi , Shanhwa , and Anting . Then , all of a sudden the storm cleared , and a tremendous vista spread out before me .  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
While SARS was prevalent , the increase in stress and the resultant weakening of immune functions enabled TB to spread and develop into active cases easily . Victims who were afraid to go to hospitals to obtain medicine or who had no one to supervise the taking of medication may also have caused increases in the number the failed treatments and the incidence of drug-resistant bacterial strains . However , SARS did at least have one salutary effect-it called the medical profession 's attention to tuberculosis .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
Can you remember road workers applying a mixture of asphalt and gravel on dirt roads ? How they would spread it lightly and evenly , laying down a black carpet ? Although asphalt smells unpleasant , we love the smooth surface of asphalt roads and the comfortable rides they provide . Indeed for most of us , our impressions about asphalt are pretty much limited to roads .  
When resources were short and a good number of books were forbidden , it was the second-hand book market that helped spread knowledge , and reading was considered more important than collecting . Today there are up to 400,000 new books published a year , so why do people still want to collect old books ? " It 's because the sheer volume of books being published is huge , it 's like a sea of books out there .  
With the rise of the Internet and the digitization of audiovisual content , technologies that were originally developed for the two different forms of transmission for video and telecommunications are using digital signal convergence to enable families to enjoy the interactive pleasures of video-on-demand through set-top boxes . Looking at the world as a whole , the spread of digital content is an unmistakable trend .  
After these decorative lines are dry , they spray on a layer of yellow paint , and then add gold leaf . Before applying the gold leaf , they 've got to first apply some glue designed for that purpose : " You 've got to precisely control the time that the gold leaf glue dries , because that will affect on the quality of the gold leaf . If it 's too wet , it 's difficult to spread evenly ; if it 's too dry , it wo n't stick . "  
The formal - and often informal - privatization of public health facilities and educational institutions in response to the erosion of public funding and spread of private providers has led to rapid social differentiation in education and health .  
Today we are witnessing the emergence of a collective consciousness , the expansion of a shared system of values , an international citizenship based on common , objective interests and the spread of more uniform lifestyles .  
We regret to observe , however , that the spread of conventional arms continues to take on a dangerous magnitude , while at the same time armed conflicts are increasing , causing the tragic loss of numerous innocent human lives .  
Despite the rapid spread of contraceptive practice , unwanted births still constituted about one fourth of total fertility at the time of surveys conducted in the developing countries in the late 1980s .  
They express their growing concern over the continued spread of drug trafficking and the enormous danger it poses to social institutions , to the observance of human rights and to democratic stability in their countries .  
But as ethnic conflicts spread and political solutions become more elusive , there is a risk that humanitarian operations could become prolonged , draining limited resources and causing untold suffering .  
High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
Hungary had supported from the very beginning the idea of indefinite extension , for we are convinced that this major international instrument promotes stability by preventing the spread of the nuclear arsenal and at the same time aims at the orderly development of nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes .  
Natural resources restored , revived and protected from continuous and uncoordinated overexploitation must be managed by citizens , families and communities , who shall learn to acquire know-how , to share knowledge , to spread information , and to tap both the vast , exciting stockpile of human knowledge and their own rich national culture .  
Another main reason for this failure is that the policies of major arms-producing countries designed to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons are always short-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at securing the destructive power of their own weaponry and their own military dominance .  
Besides the fact that it continues to be the most universal and fundamental instrument for the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons , its extension demonstrated the international community 's common desire to reject all weapons of mass destruction .  
Efforts to involve men as responsible partners in helping to satisfy such needs take on a special urgency given the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS and the potential improvement in reproductive health that would follow if programmes promoted male participation as well as male methods as part of the contraceptive choices available to couples .  
Among the most acute issues were the continuing economic deterioration , the decline in real incomes , the spread of poverty , unemployment , massive migration and a sharp worsening of living standards for what appeared to be the majority of the population .  
Ensuring that due priority is given and adequate resources made available , at the national , regional and international levels , to combat the threat to individual and public health , by the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS globally , and the re-emergence of major diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria , onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) and diarrhoeal diseases , in particular , cholera ;  
There was a need to continue the search for more effective measures to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of which posed a threat to peace and international security , especially given the growing number of regional and internal conflicts .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
I have the honour to forward to you the text of a paper providing information on the activities and views of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the three underlying objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons : to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons ; to provide a sound basis for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ; and to encourage negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to disarmament .  
NPT has become a strong barrier against the spread of nuclear weapons and a standard of civilized behaviour on the part of States at the current time with the rapid structural changes occurring in the world .  
It is the Russian Federation 's firm position that the Treaty , as a major international legal document of the nuclear age ensuring an optimum balance in terms of halting the spread of nuclear weapons , nuclear disarmament and cooperation in the peaceful uses of the atom , must be extended indefinitely and unconditionally .  Such a decision by the Conference will lay the foundation for further progress in the twenty-first century towards a non-nuclear world in the future .  
To that end , the Ministers emphasized the need for concerted action in the region against the spread of extremism , which exploited the noble and sacred values of their peoples , and against arms proliferation and drug trafficking , and for swift implementation of the measures to combat those problems adopted at the meeting on regional security held at Bamako on 22 and 23 August 1994 .  16 .  The Ministers noted with concern the difficult economic situation in their countries .  
The tense situation existing there , resulting from the exacerbation of political and ethnic problems , is significantly aggravated by the uncontrolled spread of arms among civilians and refugees , which is creating a real threat to peace and stability for all the countries of the region .  
Women , who represent half of all adults newly infected with HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases , have emphasized that social vulnerability and the unequal power relationships between women and men are obstacles to safe sex , in their efforts to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases .  
Initiatives of the Group have included : the cost-sharing venture to finance a multi-sectoral AIDS study tour for concerned Cambodian government officials in Thailand ; encouragement to the Ministry of Information to take a more active and creative approach in its efforts to inform the Cambodian public ; and improving the coordination between the different United Nations agencies involved in combating the spread of the virus .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in chapter V .  
The spread of conflicts and the magnitude of the humanitarian consequences are such as to require the international community to conduct an objective and responsible evaluation and take vigorous and efficient measures to end the spiral of armed conflicts and create conditions for peace and security without which the universal realization of the right to development will be little more than a good intention . 
Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities of stemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction , bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building capabilities , advancing sustainable economic and social development , and reinforcing our joint commitment to international law and human rights ? 
This reorganization of the international system on the basis of strategic economic objectives has been accompanied by a scientific and technological revolution , a revolution of knowledge that spread across the planet and brought about the most profound change ever experienced in the history of humankind , turning the world into one large neighbourhood .  
The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States , the tragedy of refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the consequent destruction of the environment , the spread of disease , the degeneration of moral values , the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur .  
Given the proliferation of internal conflicts and regional tensions , the harmful effects of economic disorder , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the rise of crime and terrorism , violations of human rights , the ever-widening international character of drug-trafficking networks and the deterioration of the environment , there is no single area of international relations that does not require a collective effort on the part of States if it is to be mastered . 
Effective and practical solutions must be found for the serious economic , social and humanitarian problems facing African States , which have been compounded by tragedies such as civil war , the spread of epidemics and deadly diseases , desertification , refugee problems and all they entail .  
But free trade is not just helpful to developing countries , it is a global good , its benefits are spread wide , to the producers and consumers in the developed and the developing world alike , who can profit from the greater efficiency that free trade engenders , and who can buy the best and cheapest products available on the world markets .  
We need to close ranks to meet the major challenges that can face democracy , such as poverty and all it entails , the spectre of ethnic conflict , illicit drug trafficking , international terrorism , religious fanaticism , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the ravages of malaria , and so forth .  
Currently , the health of women in Rwanda was extremely vulnerable due to lack of medical infrastructure , supplies and personnel , limited financial resources , lack of access to health care , malnutrition , unsafe drinking-water , and the spread of HIV / AIDS . Women were more susceptible to diseases than men because they were overworked , had unplanned pregnancies , were malnourished during pregnancy and suffered complications from childbirth . 
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in section V .  
Action at the national level has been coupled by international efforts to promote a culture of good governance and strengthened institutions and to systematize legislative measures to prevent and control the spread of corrupt practices .  
Ensuring that due priority is given and adequate resources made available , at the national , regional and international levels , to combat the threat to individual and public health posed by the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS globally and by the re-emergence of major diseases , such as tuberculosis , malaria , onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) and diarrhoeal diseases , in particular cholera ;  
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
Scientific journals and publications dealing with technological innovation and research are slow to reach Libya , especially publications issued by specialized international organizations and agencies that are active in disseminating information and technical data relating to the spread of plant and animal diseases and epidemics in various parts of the world .  
Drug abuse has devastating social effects , including its harmful impact on youth , families , other social groups and the workplace , and adverse health consequences as well , including those resulting from the relationship between substance abuse and a number of major diseases and disorders and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) .  
One of the issues raised was the use of modern means of communication like the Internet to spread racist propaganda , and national and international steps had been proposed to deal with that problem , such as the holding of a seminar sponsored by the Office of the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , bringing together various United Nations bodies and the Internet service providers to discuss the use of the Internet in ways consistent with human rights .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Israel has continued to spread illegal settlements in the occupied territories , provoking in response deadly terrorist attacks against innocent Israeli citizens by frustrated Palestinians who see no hope in a peace process which has been in a state of prostration for more than a year .  
Yet its subsequent , rapid spread through tainted blood and heterosexual activity increased public concern , leading to actions that , if taken earlier , would have saved many lives .  
As cholera is now thought to be endemic in Somalia , agencies , having learned from four years of experience , have designed specific prevention and control plans with the local communities to ensure water chlorination and to prevent the spread of the disease through social mobilization campaigns on country-wide radio broadcasts , local billboards , flyers and messages delivered through religious leaders .  
The importance of controlling the spread of organized crime in the region and enabling the national criminal justice systems to deal with the threat was also recognized by the development of a project that would encompass two training seminars in the application of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , with a focus on extradition and organized transnational crime , for judges , prosecutors and police officers from west African States .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
It also has a negative impact on dedicated staff members who , in a genuine effort to fulfil all mandates , have to spread themselves too thinly , are unable to stay in touch with their fields of expertise and find themselves in a spiral of constant deadlines and diminishing results .  
Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
While the overall economic performance in the least developed countries has improved , poverty remains pervasive and the majority of the population in the least developed countries suffers from reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of disease and lower school enrolment .  
Urges all States to be guided in their national policies by the need to curb the testing , the production and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering ;  
The need for an integrated and intersectoral approach to health strategies has been recognized , as well as the importance of strengthening national and international efforts to prevent and combat epidemics and other diseases that are endemic in many developing countries , and in particular to address malaria and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) more effectively .  
On the question of international drug control , he said that , in the light of the unprecedented spread of illicit drugs over the past two decades , the relevant international instruments must be implemented and the role of the United Nations must be enhanced . 
In the view of the League of Arab States , far from being limited to a specific part of the world , the dangerous consequences of terrorism will spread throughout the entire world unless there is international coordination and cooperation to combat this phenomenon , which unquestionably constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination . 
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
Although national legislation on the protection of the environment has been enacted in many countries , statutory provisions dealing with the protection of the environment were mostly spread through a whole array of legislation and regulations , mainly focusing on hazardous waste , water , soil and air pollution , trafficking in endangered species of flora and fauna , noise pollution and trafficking in nuclear substances , and contained in the various laws on these issues .  
Instead , a bleak cluster of grey buildings with large underground detention cells , characterized by a stench emanating from wet blankets spread on dirty stone floors in cells meant for three , but , according to the police , accommodating up to eight at times , provides a stark contrast to the visible efforts made at creating user _ friendly environments at police stations in , for example , the central Pretoria area .  
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) has implemented HIV / AIDS prevention projects in sub-Saharan Africa , to meet the combined objectives of industrial development and the prevention of the spread of HIV / AIDS . UNIDO is supporting improved access to and affordability of products used in prevention programmes condoms , latex gloves , syringes , HIV-1 / 2 test kits through development of local manufacturing capability . 
In this connection , it is worth noting that during the fifteenth session of the Commission on Human Settlements , some delegations expressed their concern over the tendency of the Centre to spread its resources on activities that were largely tangential to its mandate and expressed the hope that the programme of work would remain focused on human settlements development as its prime objective .  
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
Specifically , operational activities at national , subregional and regional levels addressed : preventive education for high risk groups ( school children , street children ) ; prevention for intravenous drug abusers to contain the spread of HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases ; implementation of common standards for epidemiological monitoring and systems of information on drug abuse ; prevention of drug abuse in the workplace ; and training for rehabilitation and integration of former drug addicts into society , involving health and education authorities .  
They facilitate the spread of an economic model based on the principles of a market economy , while mass advertising and the global media help shape human aspirations and perceptions of social values .  
The increasing spread of the social effects of economic phenomena , coupled with the rapid advances in technology , has made the coordination of economic policies at the international level more significant than ever before .  
At both the national and international levels , institutions to promote and protect human rights economic and social , as well as civil and political have spread , and often have flourished .  
The fast spread of this new strain to neighbouring countries facing the Bay of Bengal and the quick notification of imported cases of this strain in developed countries raised global concern about a possible new pandemic of cholera .  
As a result of unchecked environmental degradation , we anticipate an increasing number of human health crises , involving the spread of infectious diseases , more cases of malnutrition and increasing health problems associated with global atmospheric change .  
The Assembly had mandated UNCTAD to undertake analysis of current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups . 
The prospects of solving those problems were diminished by the deepening of poverty , accelerated by the spread of the current global economic crisis , the shameful decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) , the growing number of humanitarian crises involving children , and the explosion of the HIV / AIDS pandemic , the devastating effects of which threatened to undermine the hard-won gains on behalf of children .  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .  
The crisis had proved difficult to manage , partly because of its rapid spread to other countries , but more importantly because the usual prescriptions had either proved ineffective or would have involved a much longer transition , which would have caused greater losses of output and social distress .  
The international community be encouraged to cooperate fully in the various efforts , at the national , regional and global levels , for the prevention of the spread of harmful aquatic organisms through ships ballast water ;  
The Office 's background investigations of targeted violence further confirmed the observations expressed in my previous report that the nature of violent activity in Kosovo , which has now spread to urban areas , has increased the number of persons who live in fear of being directly affected by violence or arbitrary treatment .  
Taking into account the growing spread of poverty and its highly negative social and political dimensions , the special session may wish to consider what kind of national , regional and international measures can be recommended in order to reverse the negative trends .  
It was reported that the average spread on new international bond issues by developing countries ( against United States Treasury bonds of comparable final maturity and coupon ) fell from 355 basis points in 1994 to 258 basis points in the first eight months of 1997 [ 15 ] .  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
Moreover , the growth of TCDC can be measured not only through the number and range of TCDC-related projects completed or ongoing but also by the spread of new TCDC configurations , including a sharp increase in country-to-country bilateral TCDC projects , the recent phenomenon of donor country involvement in triangular funding schemes , and the proliferation of partnerships among intergovernmental organizations , non-governmental organizations and other players within the multilateral system .  
Invites States , United Nations organs , programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries , in particular the least developed countries and those in Africa , in their efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV / AIDS on the human rights of their populations ;

Invites States , United Nations organs , programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries , in particular the least developed countries and those in Africa , in their efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV / AIDS on the human rights of their populations ;  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country / sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Equally , the relationship between human behaviour and biomedical risks has also become more evident , exacerbated by the ease of rapid international transmission of public health and environmental health hazards , including food contamination , as seen for instance in the dramatic spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) throughout the world .  
It should be mentioned that following consultations with non-governmental organizations acting in the field of HIV / AIDS and representatives of United Nations agencies working in Romania , it was decided to set up a national multisectoral AIDS commission to examine the potential spread of AIDS and its consequences for the Romanian population and to assess the programmes developed so far with a view to working out a national strategy against this dreadful malady .  
Following the end of cold war , the United Nations has been called upon to take up new challenges and tasks as a result of the growing threat from the existence of large stockpiles of nuclear weapons , proposals for ballistic missile defences and the weaponization of outer space , the lack of progress in the field of disarmament , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the development and use of advanced and sophisticated conventional arms ;  
Broad agreement was reached on the mechanisms for cooperation in the areas stipulated in the Declaration , including regular trilateral contacts among the heads of the foreign policy and other interested departments , and joint consultations at various levels , in particular with a view to counteracting the spread of aggressive religious and other extremism and combating terrorism , transnational organized crime and illicit traffic in drugs and arms .  
The objectives of the joint action are : ( a ) to combat and contribute to ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons ; ( b ) to contribute to the reduction of existing accumulations of these weapons to levels consistent with the legitimate security needs of countries ; and ( c ) to help those regions suffering from the problems associated with excessive accumulation and spread of small arms to tackle them .  
Canada believes that the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons ( hereinafter referred to as small arms ) have now been widely recognized as an important issue affecting international as well as human security , one that demands urgent action .  
When the shell hits its target , normally a tank or an armoured car , it emits chemical and radioactive dust containing carcinogenic ionized atoms ( alpha-gamma ) that not only contaminates the area around the incinerated tank but is carried great distances on the wind and spread over a wide area , contaminating the air , soil , vegetation and human beings .  
The growing openness of some economies made them more vulnerable to adverse external effects and promoted the spread of local economic troubles to other regions of the world , as the recent financial crisis in Asia had demonstrated .  
Also concerned about the close link between terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , on the one hand , and the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons , on the other , and stressing the importance of international efforts aimed at combating them , Also welcoming the report of the Secretary-General on small arms , 101 prepared with the assistance of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms pursuant to General Assembly resolution 52 / 38 J ,  
Ms . Viotti ( Brazil ) said that ethnic cleansing , the resurgence of false doctrines of racial superiority , the trend towards restricting the rights of migrant workers , the use of new technologies to spread intolerance and the abuses committed against asylum-seekers and refugees were just some of the obstacles which the international community must overcome to keep alive the spirit that had inspired the historic struggle to put an end to racism .  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts , in order to promote international financial stability , and to this end to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Therefore criminal groups spread into sectors where the risk of being arrested and heavily sentenced is relatively low , especially compared to the attractive economic return . 15 Responses are advocated that may reduce such normative inconsistencies while reducing the mobility of transnational organized groups . 
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts to promote international financial stability and , to this end , to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crises in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
This has now changed to a vicious circle of depressed exports which discouraged investment , and vice versa ; the depression spread over the region and dampened exports which , together with low consumption resulting from uncertain economic prospects decreased aggregate demand and discouraged investment for the future .  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
As the Secretary-General suggests , changing international circumstances including the spread of notions of individual rights and the idea that the international community has a responsibility to respond effectively to humanitarian crises are challenging traditional notions of national sovereignty .  
Having recognized the value of open economies , we should , however , be ready to address emerging population problems such as increasing migration including transit migration , outflow of the most productive young strata of society from the less developed economies to the more prosperous ones , drug trafficking and the spread of AIDS and other dangerous diseases , to name but a few .  
In moving towards a world in which the benefits of scientific and technological change are spread more widely across society , public and private institutions will increasingly be called upon to motivate and interact with a larger and more diverse number of actors than in the past , for the process of innovation is interactive and system-wide .  
However , the efforts to spread basic education in rural areas are hampered by a number of constraints of a geographical , economic and cultural nature ( absence of means of communication , scattered habitations , mountainous areas in certain regions , etc . ) .  
Since 1994 , ICEPS has helped to spread information on the main activities implemented and planned by the Economic and Social Council , and , in general , by the United Nations system among actors with which ICEPS maintains regular relations and among institutions interested , at the national level , in United Nations activities but without access to adequate and updated means of information .  
Nigeria accounts for 25 per cent of the global spread of AIDS in 1998 , with over half a-million new infections ; yet , efforts to educate the public about AIDS prevention and management are insufficient . 8 The health needs of special or particular groups such as pregnant women , the aged and the disabled , are also neglected . 
Not only does the use of arms complicate the search for a peaceful resolution of differences , but it is also a source of much human suffering : the displacement of populations , the destruction of socio-economic infrastructures acquired at the cost of great efforts , massive flows of refugees into bordering countries and the sudden spread of disease.This list is not an exhaustive one by any means . 
One such seminar , to be held in Geneva in January 2000 under the auspices of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , would consider penal , civil and administrative remedies for victims of racist acts and would also discuss sound practices used by governmental and non-governmental bodies to assist such victims as well as methods employed such as mediation , conciliation and preventing the spread of racism .  
On the one hand , we have witnessed of amazing scientific , technological and material progress , the spread of human rights and democracy and the development of universal international institutions .  
These include local and regional armed conflicts , growing indebtedness , rampant poverty , scarcity of financial resources , and the spread of dangerous diseases such as HIV / AIDS and malaria .  
How can we spread the implementation of human rights across the globe so that the practice of rights economic , social and cultural , and civil and political can foster cultures of respect and tolerance , in the framework of fundamental human rights ?  
The Special Rapporteur asks for urgent national and international action at all levels to combat extreme poverty and social exclusion , whose spread may lead to continued instability that could weaken the peace process and impede peaceful coexistence .  
They pledged to make new efforts aimed at the total elimination of nuclear arsenals , halting the global spread of nuclear weapons and strengthening the essential standards governing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
It justly identified deepening poverty and inequality , proliferating conflict , the deadly spread of the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) and continuing discrimination , particularly against women and girls , as formidable challenges in developing future actions for children .  
Also express our concern in this regard that external interference , mainly linked to the exploitation of minerals and the arms trade , an unfavourable international economic environment and foreign debt , are the main contributing factors in the spread of conflicts and instability in Africa ;  
Deeply concerned that , 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Deeply concerned that , 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
A central challenge is to ensure a stable , predictable , non-discriminatory , transparent , fair and equitable multilateral trading system in support of development , which contributes in a coherent manner to spread the benefits of trade to all developing countries , ensuring rapid and sustained growth of incomes and exports to finance their development goals .  
Recognize that education and lifelong learning are basic for the respect of the racial , ethnic , cultural , linguistic and religious diversity of our societies which is essential to prevent the spread of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and is of key importance for protecting and promoting democratic values ;  
The suffering of large numbers of children especially infants and nursing mothers from lack of primary health care , basic health services and malnutrition or unbalanced diets , lack of clean drinking water and proper sanitation , especially in rural and desert areas , poor districts and refugee camps , increased hazards of environmental pollution , dangers of the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and lack of care provided to children with special needs ;  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
Greater awareness is also needed of global negatives illicit drugs , transnational crime , tobacco and of ways in which globalization is fostering them , leading to a more effective integration of the policy and regulatory framework required to address them into the overall actions being promoted to spread and maximize the potential benefits of globalization .  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
This dire prognosis is based on the analysis of the current epidemiological situation in Georgia and neighbouring countries , all of which are experiencing widespread drug abuse , increased migration , and lack of disposable medical instruments and diagnostic test systems , among other factors .  Currently , Georgia is still within the so-called window of opportunity for preventing the massive spread of HIV / AIDS .  
By 2003 , establish national prevention targets , recognizing and addressing factors leading to the spread of the epidemic and increasing peoples vulnerability , to reduce HIV incidence for those identifiable groups , within particular local contexts , which currently have high or increasing rates of HIV infection , or which available public health information indicates are at the highest risk for new infection ;  
By 2003 , have in place national strategies to address the spread of HIV among national uniformed services , where this is required , including armed forces and civil defence force and consider ways of using personnel from these services who are educated and trained in HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention to assist with HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention activities including participation in emergency , humanitarian , disaster relief and rehabilitation assistance ;  
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
We note with regret that certain media circles , by promoting false images , particularly of migrant workers and refugees , have contributed to the spread of xenophobic sentiments among the public and have encouraged violence by racist groups ; 96 .  We recognize the positive contribution the exercise of the right to freedom of expression ,  
Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
It is easy to see that we are dealing with an act devoid of any military objective whose sole aim was simply to spread death , suffering and destruction of our people in the most atrocious way .  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
The manifestations of that daily horror are daily massacres of the civilian population , summary and extrajudicial executions , the deportation of entire populations , the taking of hostages , hijacking , the illegal capture and destruction of aircraft , the systematic rape and burying alive of women , destitution , other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , the deliberate and criminal spread of HIV / AIDS , and so forth .  
He expressed the hope that the outcomes of the Fourth World Tourism Organization Ministerial Conference and the World Summit on Sustainable Development could provide help to developing countries in their efforts , inter alia , to feed the poor and provide shelter ; halt and reverse the spread of HIV / AIDS ; provide safe drinking water ; and offer employment to the millions of unemployed youth .  
The participants acknowledged that the spread of internal conflicts requires enhanced international and regional cooperation to tackle their root causes and committed themselves to improving coordination of their efforts in the fields of preventive action and peace-building .  
Moreover , the civilian self-defence policy encouraged by the Government , which has enabled civilians to be trained in weapons handling , has spread to most of the northern , southern , eastern and central provinces .  
Notwithstanding the fresh hopes for a safer environment brought about by the end of the cold war , the world has experienced a proliferation of regional conflicts and armed hostilities , and has witnessed a trend towards the spread and destabilizing accumulation of sophisticated weapons systems , including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
Impacts of global warming include an accelerated rise in sea levels , increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events , changes in patterns and levels of precipitation , the drying of arid and semi-arid areas from decreased precipitation , and the spread of vector borne diseases .  
In addition , pursuant to Security Council resolution 1308 ( 2000 ) of 17 July 2000 , and in the light of the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection among the population of Sierra Leone as well as among the Missions military and civilian personnel , it is proposed that a post for an HIV / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) policy officer be established at the P-4 level .  
Besides poverty reduction , the international community had given specific commitments to ensure that by 2015 boys and girls would have equal access to primary schooling and had also resolved to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters , to reduce child mortality by two thirds , to restrict the spread of HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , and to improve the conditions of 100-million urban poor by 2020 .  
Noting with satisfaction that the international community is more than ever aware of the importance of such practical disarmament measures , especially with regard to the growing problems arising from the excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons , which pose a threat to peace and security and reduce the prospects for economic development in many regions , particularly in post-conflict situations ,  
In January 2000 , the Security Council had recognized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic to which women and girls were especially vulnerable was a major threat to development and security , while the Commission on the Status of Women had emphasized that the full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights was of crucial importance in preventing the further spread of the disease .  
As a consequence , the plague of hijackings of aircraft in mid-flight soon spread to the United States itself , where , for the most varied reasons , a number of people , most of them unbalanced individuals , adventurers or common criminals , from both the United States and Latin America , began to hijack aircraft , armed with firearms , knives , Molotov cocktails and sometimes just bottles of water made to look as though they contained gasoline , with which they threatened to set the aircraft on fire .  
Enhance mass media to spread information about sustainable development issues , specifically ideas for how to make a positive change from the personal to the international scale , and to become an educational tool through channels such as interconnected radio , television and the Internet ;  
Poverty , which poses a fundamental challenge to sustainable development in the Arab world , requiring rational utilization of available resources , the creation of a suitable climate for investment both locally and regionally , the establishment of a mechanism of social solidarity at the national level , the achievement of integration among Arab States in various areas and the granting of priority to Arab labour to help curb unemployment and the spread of poverty ;  
Ensure international , regional and South-South cooperation , including development assistance and additional adequate resources to implement gender-sensitive policies and programmes aimed at halting the spread of the epidemic in providing affordable quality treatment and care of all people , especially women and girls living with HIV / AIDS ;
