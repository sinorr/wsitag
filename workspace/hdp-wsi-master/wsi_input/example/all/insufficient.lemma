In view of the drop in people 's income expectations and the rise in their expenditure expectations , and their insufficient consumption capacity , we raised the standard of the basic living needs of workers laid off from state enterprises , the unemployed , those urban residents eligible for the lowest basic living needs , and others on low incomes , and increased the wages of workers of organs , undertakings , and units , and the pensions of retired personnel .  
With the establishment of the market economic system , the change of the macroeconomic situation and , the increase of the total national economic strength , the not high enough quality of the economy in Beijing 's suburbs , its weak ability to adapt to changes , and its insufficient staying power for development are manifesting themselves ever more clearly , and they are becoming the important factors restricting Beijing 's agricultural and rural development .  1 .  
Facing the contradiction that has appeared , between periodic and structural surplus versus a domestic market potential that is a long way from being realized , and facing the contradiction that while market demand for a large quantity of commodities is insufficient , we still rely on imports for some special products , especially key technical equipment , we must be determined to solve some outstanding problems such as irrational economic structure .  
The deputies and committee members were of the view : Although currently the overall situation is marked by social stability and sustained economic growth , we have been facing in-depth contradictions and problems accumulated over the years and new challenges arising from phased changes in economic development , such as effective demand in the domestic market has been insufficient , contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure have become increasingly prominent , the employment pressure has increased , and increase in peasants ' incomes have slowed down .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
Zeng Peiyan said : Of course , there are also problems accompanying our advance and development , the major ones being the insufficient effective demand , slowing growth in fixed assets investment , irrational economic structure , production and operational difficulties of some state-owned enterprises [ SOE 's ] , growing employment pressure , and slow growth of peasants ' income .  
However , the capital city 's education still has many problems which urgently need to be resolved : there remains a prominent contradiction between the growing education needs of the masses of the people and education 's insufficient supply in quantitative terms and low quality ;  
In the beginning of the transitional leap , since our experience was limited , and our funding was insufficient , we were in this kind of " point by point developmental mode " and special project construction had was logically based , but by now we should have already arrived at " unification " - - systems integration - - time .  We must conclude the separate explorations of the initial period and enter an integration phase as soon as possible .  
Since 1997 , with reference to those issues like the Asian financial crisis , insufficient effective domestic demands , and so on , active financial policies and firm and steady monetary policies were implemented .  Through issuing national debts , expanding investments , promoting consumption , and increasing exports , the deflation development tendency has been effectively stopped .  
From the start , JBIV has been rather attentive to drawing other news media 's development experience and paid attention to developing an internet medium by making use of its own traditional superiority under the conditions of insufficient personnel and funds and relatively weak technical support .  
In this way , they have effectively solved the difficult problem of insufficient sustained supporting strength for the airborne troops , and the airborne troops now have reliable " mobile warehouses " .  This indicates the airborne troops have taken a historical leap forward from being able to air-drop troops alone to being able to conduct combined operations .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
As a result , agriculture was generally regarded as an " inferior " industry .  After liberalized reforms , although agriculture and the rural economies have developed rapidly , the issue of " inferiority " has not been fundamentally solved .  In addition to insufficient inputs into agriculture by the government , agriculture was restricted by both natural and market risks , and agricultural conditions increasingly deteriorated .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
In developed countries , the proportion of laborers engaged in agricultural production is less than 5 percent , but it is as high as 50 percent in China . In the vast rural areas , the phenomenon of insufficient employment among the peasants is relatively common , so it is a pressing task to readjust agricultural and rural economic structures and do a good job of transferring surplus rural labor forces .  
The insufficient development of the tertiary industry is a principal problem existing in China 's industrial structure .  Since the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , given the rapid development attained in the tertiary industry and its increasing proportion held in the GDP , there is still a big gap as compared with other countries in the world .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
An analysis by a military expert of Taiwan Gao Xiongbo says : " Arms race is very costly .  Because Taiwan 's enterprises have a special background of relationship between the government and the commercial sector , most of them are leaning toward shortsightedness for immediate gain .  Taiwan 's industry is narrow and shallow and is fundamentally insufficient to support a wide-ranging and a long-term arms race .  
For instance , our per-capita natural resources are lower than the average global level , insufficient education among our people contrasts with the rapid growth of economic and social management and scientific and technological knowledge , and these kinds of restrictions deny China either a resource advantage or a technological advantage for international economic cooperation .  
Such a judgment that sets academic backgrounds and knowledge against practice is a mentality of finding fault with and making excessive demands on high-quality talent ; and in the eyes of people with such a mentality , high-quality talent " are not bold and vigorous enough in their work but are holding themselves aloof , " lack mature skills in leading the troops , have insufficient drive in exercising control , and are engaged in impractical scientific research and studies .  
There are two reasons why the United States has decided to give up its strategy of " winning two local wars breaking out simultaneously . "  First , the United States has been feeling that its military strength and transport capability are inadequate and its financial resources are insufficient , making it difficult to continue to hit others using two fists at the same time .  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .  
During the Ninth FYP , faced with the dual pressure of the Asian financial crisis and insufficient effective domestic demand , China further expanded the fields and scale of utilization of foreign investment while practicing a proactive fiscal policy and making efforts to increase domestic demand , and such utilization played an important stimulating role .  
If a county indeed has difficulties in funding teachers ' wages due to insufficient financial resources , the problem should be solved by readjusting expenditure structure and by increasing central fiscal transfer payment to local authorities .  The increase of teachers ' income should absolutely not be done by raising the taxtbook fee and miscellaneous fee .  
Borrowing from the military region signal regiment 's achievements in the scientific and technical training of troops , the group army 's signal elements overcame the difficulty of insufficient amounts of equipment and materials , and scientifically conducted " three defenses " training in defending against enemy reconnaissance and surveillance , defending against enemy electronic jamming , and defending against an enemy 's precise attacks .  
However , the development of the railway transportation capacity still can not satisfy the needs in our national economic and social development .  One of the basic needs for us to " represent the requirements of the development of advanced productive forces " is to quicken railway development and to strive to change the current insufficient capacity of railway transportation as soon as possible .  
Judging from these situations , the overall environment of this year 's economic work is good .  The negative factors are that currently demand for essential goods is insufficient and the employment pressure has increased and probably will be quite reduced as the international economic situation has further turned for the better and as the effect and results of the state 's macroeconomic regulation and control measures gradually come into play .  
However , we should be clearly aware of the existing problems : Today , an insufficient effective demand and an irrational economic structure still remain predominant problems , no new consumption hot spot is expected in the near future , problems accumulated over the years in the country 's economic life have been exposed in a concentrated way , and there are still many uncertainties in the international market .  All these problems ought to be brought to our close attention .  
However , the absolute quantity of civilian products produced by armament industry enterprises declined rapidly , mainly because of insufficient investment , debt payment failures , competition of foreign goods , unsuccessful privatization , and technological and operational difficulties in changing products .

However , the absolute quantity of civilian products produced by armament industry enterprises declined rapidly , mainly because of insufficient investment , debt payment failures , competition of foreign goods , unsuccessful privatization , and technological and operational difficulties in changing products .  
Since early this year , in view of insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other deep-rooted problems , China has continued to embraced a positive financial policy ; at the same time , it has implemented a comprehensive western region development strategy and quickened the pace of entering the WTO , bringing about crucial favorable turns in the investment , export , consumption , and other fields .  
Chinese leaders have repeatedly pointed out that insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other " persistent economic ailments " are still obstructing China 's economy from developing in a sustained and healthy manner .  
To deal with such conspicuous problems as insufficient domestic demand , intensified export competition , greater unemployment pressure , irrational economic structure , and slow increase in peasants ' income , as well as the challenge of the Southeast Asian financial crisis , the Chinese government has adopted a correct policy of increasing government investment to boost domestic demand and promote economic growth .  
On the other hand , we must see that the factors constraining the economic rebound , such as insufficient effective social demand , conspicuous structural contradictions in the economy , continued " obstructions " to developing the consumer goods market , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes , remain very prominent , and we must maintain effective political direction and support to provide correct guidance for the economic momentum .  
However , we should also see that these changes are still initial ones , the foundation of economic recovery has not yet been solid , some structural and deep-seated problems in economic development have not been solved , and the situation of insufficient effective demand has not basically improved .  
He said , viewed from the industry , state-owned enterprises depend heavily on the high international oil prices , the low interest rates of banks , the conversion of debts into shares , the relief of their social functions , and other measures at the macroeconomic level .  Internal factors at the microeconomic level , such as the lowering of the costs of enterprises , the improvement in quality , and the readjustment and optimization of structure are still insufficient .  
Even though the specific behaviors of and causes of the problems of some leading bodies and leading cadres in the aspect of party spirit and party styles are not completely identical , they are all directly related to their insufficient theoretical study .  To resolve these problems , it is imperative to arm their mind with theory and base themselves upon study and improvement .  Though discussions , they have unified their thinking and understanding and taken an active part in the theoretical study .  
He said : Compared with the mature markets , China 's securities markets still need to be further strengthened in terms of legislation , supervision , standardization , and so on .  There still exist such problems as insufficient extent of market standardization , lack of personnel and means for monitoring and controlling the conduct of market manipulation and the fraud of investors , limited extent of market internationalization , unitary market level and variety , and imperfect structure , among other things .  
Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .  As a result of the insufficient financial input in rural public health undertakings , many grass-roots hospitals and clinics remain in very poor conditions .  Buildings are simple and crude ;  
equipment is obsolete and outmoded ; technical and professional human resources are insufficient .  The unreasonable distribution of public health resources in rural areas has affected the development of public health undertakings in the vast countryside .  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .  
It was reported that , owing to insufficient sewage treatment capacity , the Shatin Sewage Treatment Works has been intermittently discharging sewage with pollutants level exceeding the stipulated permissible limits ( " sub-standard sewage " ) since 1996 , resulting in the deterioration of the water quality of the Victoria Harbour . To address the problem , the Administration planned to expand the Treatment Works and Phase I of the project was expected to be completed in 4 years ' time .  
The spokesman pointed out that major faults found on most motor-driven bicycles and skateboards included weak and misaligned vehicle frames , weak steering handle bar and seating frame , insufficient and unreliable braking system , inadequate lightings and reflectors , lacking essential equipment such as rear view mirror and speedometer .  
3 .  Rents charged by the Housing Authority are insufficient to meet recurrent operating expenses .  The Housing Authority 's rental deficit for 2001-02 is in the region of $ 2.7 billion , which works out to be an average subsidy of $ 4,000 per household .  
This would not only increase the Government 's fiscal burden in the future by incurring substantial additional expenditure , but also fail to address the current structural problem of insufficient recurrent revenue to cover recurrent expenditure .  
Members also observed that the technical measures introduced to improve the Currency Board system in 1998 ( including the introduction of the discount window and a substantial increase in the size of the Monetary Base ) had , through reducing the sensitivity of interest rates to speculative attacks , probably reduced the amount by which GDP and prices would decline following a speculative attack .  They noted , however , that there was , for the time being , insufficient empirical data for this to be clearly shown .  
The development of society in a pluralistic direction and the government 's ability to adapt to a changing situation must be strengthened . The public consensus with regard to national development is inadequate , creating confusion and differences in value concepts that have led to a deterioration in law and order , urban traffic congestion , soaring realty prices , serious environmental pollution , rampant economic speculation , insufficient recreational facilities , and a widening gap in the distribution of wealth .  
When Lin Chung-cheng , an Academia Sinica researcher in social sciences , examined the early economic differences between native Taiwanese and mainlanders , he discovered that native businesses tended to take root among the general public and situate themselves in downstream manufacturing , while mainlander businesses were mostly developing upstream supply industries which could avoid the market weakness of insufficient human resources .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types . Years ago Mei Lanfang combined traits of the qingyi ( leading female ) and huadan ( vivacious female ) roles to create a new type of role , the huashan , that combines features of both .  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
Furthermore , public electricity service in Nicaragua was unreliable , and brown-outs were common . The electric generator which the hotel used had insufficient wattage , so embarrassing episodes of guests with heads full of soap suds wrapped in bath robes screaming complaints were all too common .  
This will make it much easier for them to understand the abstract concepts . But if this previous experience is insufficient , or if the students are having trouble with step-by-step logical reasoning-such as understanding that if two sides of triangle are equal , then their corresponding angles are as well-then when they get to analysis required in more advanced geometry , they 're going to have trouble , " says teacher Lin Chia-jung .  
Lin Chia-jung points out that junior high math teachers are too hurried in the way they teach . Students have had insufficient previous experience with abstract reasoning , and because complex geometrical concepts are unconnected to daily life , geometry becomes a source of math anxiety .  
There have been several attempts to get around the problem of insufficient objectivity in the diagnostic methods . Dr . Julia Tsuei and Chung Chieh , the former head of the traditional medical center at Veteran 's Memorial Hospital , developed the " Qin Value Detector " based on the principles of acupuncture and the meridian system .  
In Asia , the main reason for inadequate production of staple foods ( most importantly rice ) was backward farming techniques and insufficient fertilizers . Because of this , in 1968 the Asian and Pacific Council ( ASPAC ) , a regional forum of foreign ministers , began to discuss solutions , and decided to set up the FFTC .  
Although the rapid expansion of senior technical and vocational education has been able to meet student demand for degrees , another problem has arisen . With the rapid transformation of Taiwan 's industrial structure , there has been an increase in demand for individuals with specific skills . Vocational education now faces the problem of providing people with skills for which there is insufficient market demand . Supply and demand imbalance  
Besides the public 's complaints that how to sort waste is not clearly defined and that the collection procedure is inconvenient , environmental groups are concerned that instituting the policy without adequate supporting measures-giving rise to problems such as insufficient publicity , the failure to purchase dedicated vehicles for collecting kitchen waste , and the still-incomplete state of processing sites-will undermine its effectiveness .

It has been said , but can not be repeated enough and no school of thought , no economic-development specialist can contradict me that the development process in Africa will come to a standstill if the efforts of the African States continue to be bogged down by the burden of external debt , if flows of capital continue to be insufficient , if the obstacles limiting market access persist , if commodities are not diversified or changed and if the terms of trade remain depressed .  
Owing to insufficient consultations and negotiations at the Conference , reasonable views and opinions of some States that have major interests in marine fisheries failed to be duly reflected in relevant provisions .  The actual implementation of these Articles may encounter many difficulties and may increase the differences and disputes between States with conflicting interests .  
These steps , however , constitute only a technical management of the arms race , and are insufficient : they leave the international community far short of the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons recognized by the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
The most important symptoms reflecting insufficient capacity include the slow pace of policy and institutional reform ; weak intersectoral coordination ; the non-adoption of forestry programmes as priorities at the highest political levels ; the lack of clearly defined priorities ; and a continuing over-reliance on external technical assistance .  
It is reasonable to expect that the head of a mission who foresees that the available funds will not suffice for the normal work of his mission , or who is faced with the fact of insufficient or irregular financing , will promptly report the matter to the competent national authorities with a view to according to the question of financing the highest priority and utmost importance .

The real challenge in the area of reforming the social sector is to transcend the current limitations of its organizations , which are isolated , inflexible , overly centralized , hostile to genuine participation , unwilling to address the problems created by power struggles , reluctant to cooperate , of insufficient importance in the State apparatus and lacking in professional career paths for managers and in managers with specialized training in the social sphere .  
Overly complex administrative procedures , lack of awareness within the judicial process and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of all women , coupled with the underrepresentation of women in justice systems , insufficient information on existing rights and persistent attitudes and practices , perpetuate women 's de facto inequality . ]

In these cities and towns , large sections of the world 's urban population live in inadequate conditions and are confronted with serious problems , including environmental problems , that are exacerbated by inadequate planning and managerial capacities , lack of investment and technology , and insufficient mobilization and inappropriate allocation of financial resources , as well as by a lack of social and economic opportunities .  
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and , in some cases , inadequate access to technologies , may all hinder implementation and compliance .

With the establishment of the market economic system , the change of the macroeconomic situation and , the increase of the total national economic strength , the not high enough quality of the economy in Beijing 's suburbs , its weak ability to adapt to changes , and its insufficient staying power for development are manifesting themselves ever more clearly , and they are becoming the important factors restricting Beijing 's agricultural and rural development .  1 .  
Facing the contradiction that has appeared , between periodic and structural surplus versus a domestic market potential that is a long way from being realized , and facing the contradiction that while market demand for a large quantity of commodities is insufficient , we still rely on imports for some special products , especially key technical equipment , we must be determined to solve some outstanding problems such as irrational economic structure .  
The deputies and committee members were of the view : Although currently the overall situation is marked by social stability and sustained economic growth , we have been facing in-depth contradictions and problems accumulated over the years and new challenges arising from phased changes in economic development , such as effective demand in the domestic market has been insufficient , contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure have become increasingly prominent , the employment pressure has increased , and increase in peasants ' incomes have slowed down .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
Zeng Peiyan said : Of course , there are also problems accompanying our advance and development , the major ones being the insufficient effective demand , slowing growth in fixed assets investment , irrational economic structure , production and operational difficulties of some state-owned enterprises [ SOE 's ] , growing employment pressure , and slow growth of peasants ' income .

In the beginning of the transitional leap , since our experience was limited , and our funding was insufficient , we were in this kind of " point by point developmental mode " and special project construction had was logically based , but by now we should have already arrived at " unification " - - systems integration - - time .  We must conclude the separate explorations of the initial period and enter an integration phase as soon as possible .  
Since 1997 , with reference to those issues like the Asian financial crisis , insufficient effective domestic demands , and so on , active financial policies and firm and steady monetary policies were implemented .

From the start , JBIV has been rather attentive to drawing other news media 's development experience and paid attention to developing an internet medium by making use of its own traditional superiority under the conditions of insufficient personnel and funds and relatively weak technical support .  
In this way , they have effectively solved the difficult problem of insufficient sustained supporting strength for the airborne troops , and the airborne troops now have reliable " mobile warehouses " .  This indicates the airborne troops have taken a historical leap forward from being able to air-drop troops alone to being able to conduct combined operations .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
As a result , agriculture was generally regarded as an " inferior " industry .  After liberalized reforms , although agriculture and the rural economies have developed rapidly , the issue of " inferiority " has not been fundamentally solved .  In addition to insufficient inputs into agriculture by the government , agriculture was restricted by both natural and market risks , and agricultural conditions increasingly deteriorated .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
In developed countries , the proportion of laborers engaged in agricultural production is less than 5 percent , but it is as high as 50 percent in China . In the vast rural areas , the phenomenon of insufficient employment among the peasants is relatively common , so it is a pressing task to readjust agricultural and rural economic structures and do a good job of transferring surplus rural labor forces .  
The insufficient development of the tertiary industry is a principal problem existing in China 's industrial structure .  Since the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , given the rapid development attained in the tertiary industry and its increasing proportion held in the GDP , there is still a big gap as compared with other countries in the world .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
An analysis by a military expert of Taiwan Gao Xiongbo says : " Arms race is very costly .  Because Taiwan 's enterprises have a special background of relationship between the government and the commercial sector , most of them are leaning toward shortsightedness for immediate gain .  Taiwan 's industry is narrow and shallow and is fundamentally insufficient to support a wide-ranging and a long-term arms race .  
For instance , our per-capita natural resources are lower than the average global level , insufficient education among our people contrasts with the rapid growth of economic and social management and scientific and technological knowledge , and these kinds of restrictions deny China either a resource advantage or a technological advantage for international economic cooperation .  
Such a judgment that sets academic backgrounds and knowledge against practice is a mentality of finding fault with and making excessive demands on high-quality talent ; and in the eyes of people with such a mentality , high-quality talent " are not bold and vigorous enough in their work but are holding themselves aloof , " lack mature skills in leading the troops , have insufficient drive in exercising control , and are engaged in impractical scientific research and studies .  
There are two reasons why the United States has decided to give up its strategy of " winning two local wars breaking out simultaneously . "  First , the United States has been feeling that its military strength and transport capability are inadequate and its financial resources are insufficient , making it difficult to continue to hit others using two fists at the same time .  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .  
During the Ninth FYP , faced with the dual pressure of the Asian financial crisis and insufficient effective domestic demand , China further expanded the fields and scale of utilization of foreign investment while practicing a proactive fiscal policy and making efforts to increase domestic demand , and such utilization played an important stimulating role .  
If a county indeed has difficulties in funding teachers ' wages due to insufficient financial resources , the problem should be solved by readjusting expenditure structure and by increasing central fiscal transfer payment to local authorities .  The increase of teachers ' income should absolutely not be done by raising the taxtbook fee and miscellaneous fee .  
Borrowing from the military region signal regiment 's achievements in the scientific and technical training of troops , the group army 's signal elements overcame the difficulty of insufficient amounts of equipment and materials , and scientifically conducted " three defenses " training in defending against enemy reconnaissance and surveillance , defending against enemy electronic jamming , and defending against an enemy 's precise attacks .  
However , the development of the railway transportation capacity still can not satisfy the needs in our national economic and social development .  One of the basic needs for us to " represent the requirements of the development of advanced productive forces " is to quicken railway development and to strive to change the current insufficient capacity of railway transportation as soon as possible .  
Judging from these situations , the overall environment of this year 's economic work is good .  The negative factors are that currently demand for essential goods is insufficient and the employment pressure has increased and probably will be quite reduced as the international economic situation has further turned for the better and as the effect and results of the state 's macroeconomic regulation and control measures gradually come into play .  
However , we should be clearly aware of the existing problems : Today , an insufficient effective demand and an irrational economic structure still remain predominant problems , no new consumption hot spot is expected in the near future , problems accumulated over the years in the country 's economic life have been exposed in a concentrated way , and there are still many uncertainties in the international market .  All these problems ought to be brought to our close attention .  
However , the absolute quantity of civilian products produced by armament industry enterprises declined rapidly , mainly because of insufficient investment , debt payment failures , competition of foreign goods , unsuccessful privatization , and technological and operational difficulties in changing products .

Since early this year , in view of insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other deep-rooted problems , China has continued to embraced a positive financial policy ; at the same time , it has implemented a comprehensive western region development strategy and quickened the pace of entering the WTO , bringing about crucial favorable turns in the investment , export , consumption , and other fields .  
Chinese leaders have repeatedly pointed out that insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other " persistent economic ailments " are still obstructing China 's economy from developing in a sustained and healthy manner .  
To deal with such conspicuous problems as insufficient domestic demand , intensified export competition , greater unemployment pressure , irrational economic structure , and slow increase in peasants ' income , as well as the challenge of the Southeast Asian financial crisis , the Chinese government has adopted a correct policy of increasing government investment to boost domestic demand and promote economic growth .  
On the other hand , we must see that the factors constraining the economic rebound , such as insufficient effective social demand , conspicuous structural contradictions in the economy , continued " obstructions " to developing the consumer goods market , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes , remain very prominent , and we must maintain effective political direction and support to provide correct guidance for the economic momentum .  
However , we should also see that these changes are still initial ones , the foundation of economic recovery has not yet been solid , some structural and deep-seated problems in economic development have not been solved , and the situation of insufficient effective demand has not basically improved .  
He said , viewed from the industry , state-owned enterprises depend heavily on the high international oil prices , the low interest rates of banks , the conversion of debts into shares , the relief of their social functions , and other measures at the macroeconomic level .  Internal factors at the microeconomic level , such as the lowering of the costs of enterprises , the improvement in quality , and the readjustment and optimization of structure are still insufficient .  
Even though the specific behaviors of and causes of the problems of some leading bodies and leading cadres in the aspect of party spirit and party styles are not completely identical , they are all directly related to their insufficient theoretical study .  To resolve these problems , it is imperative to arm their mind with theory and base themselves upon study and improvement .  Though discussions , they have unified their thinking and understanding and taken an active part in the theoretical study .  
He said : Compared with the mature markets , China 's securities markets still need to be further strengthened in terms of legislation , supervision , standardization , and so on .
