The Ministers stressed the critical role of capital markets in raising the level of domestic savings , attracting foreign private investment , and stemming and reversing capital flight .  
The coordinated cuts in interest rates in late 1998 proved effective in avoiding a further deterioration in the global economy at that time , but the global consequences of a move in the opposite direction are untested under the prevailing macroeconomic environment where a number of largely intangible factors , such as investor confidence , play such a critical role .  
A critical historiography of international relations clearly shows the dangers of this particular kind of reasoning , which projects into the past the current domesticated status of indigenous peoples as it evolved from developments that took place mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century under the impact of legal positivism and other theories advocated by European colonial powers and their continuators .  
Although trade expansion can be an instrument for fostering the development process , official development assistance ( ODA ) also plays a critical role in financing important capital investments , particularly in social and physical infrastructure , for which trade flows and foreign direct investment if available are not always an effective substitute .

The critical issue to be put on the development agenda for Africa is why macroeconomic reforms in Africa have not generated the expected microeconomic responses and have not promoted significant changes in technological capability , improvements in factory-wide skill levels , higher productivity , better manufactured export performance and greater value added in the domestic economies .

As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .
