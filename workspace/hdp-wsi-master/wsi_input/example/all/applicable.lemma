Since its address to the Sixth Committee at the previous session , ICRC had continued its work to clarify the content of international humanitarian law and to ensure its continued adaptation to the conditions of modern warfare , with particular emphasis on its applicability to United Nations peacekeeping and enforcement operations , on rules applicable to war at sea , and on the prohibition of anti-personnel mines and blinding laser weapons .  
In all cases where the responsibility of a corporate body is engaged , the maximum fine applicable to such a body is equal to five times that provided for natural persons by the statute punishing the offence ( art . 131 _ 41 of the new Penal Code ) .  
Please provide information on the measures adopted pursuant to article 38 , including of a legislative , administrative and educational nature , to respect and ensure respect for the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to the State in armed conflicts which are relevant to the child .  
With respect to article 40 , paragraph 2 , please indicate the relevant international instruments applicable in the area of the administration of juvenile justice , including at the multilateral , regional or bilateral levels , as well as legislative and other appropriate measures adopted to ensure in particular that :  
To defray costs that are involved in accepting gratis personnel , the standard practice of the United Nations is to apply the policy established for technical cooperation experts ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) and other contributions , and charge 13 per cent for the support services and an additional 1 per cent , if applicable , for compensation to gratis personnel in the event of injury , illness or death attributable to the performance of services on behalf of the United Nations .  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people , and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
The Court of Appeal further stressed that the contract had been concluded between a seller with its place of business in France and a buyer resident in Portugal , that France was a State Party to CISG whereas Portugal had neither signed nor ratified it , and that it was therefore necessary to ascertain whether CISG was applicable through the provisions of private international law ( art . 1 ( 1 ) ( b ) ) .  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
However , since special arrangements regulating the diversity of such objects do not exist in the applicable international law and considering probable future technological developments in this area , a single and unified regime does not seem legally necessary at this stage .  
National level criteria and indicators should be formulated through a transparent process involving all [ relevant ] [ interested ] parties , including forest owners , [ native forest dwellers and NGOs ] [ forest dwellers , indigenous people and local communities , as well as major groups , where applicable ] .  
The Cape Town Workshop encourages governments , international and regional organizations as well as non _ governmental organizations and civil society to promote a debate on the need for and use of minimum humanitarian standards or standards of humanity applicable in all circumstances as well as on practical measures aimed at the improvement of the situation of those affected .  
After having considered the note , the Executive Committee , at its forty-seventh session , adopted a conclusion on comprehensive and regional approaches within a protection framework , 4 which identified certain principal elements of protection-based comprehensive approaches and encouraged States , in coordination and cooperation with each other , and with international organizations , if applicable , to consider the adoption of such approaches . 
As to allegations that the host country was ignoring legal instruments on diplomatic privileges and immunities and interfering with the functioning of the Cuban Mission , he reiterated the United States Mission 's position that the applicable principles of conventional and customary international law neither prohibited the imposition of travel restrictions nor entitled the affected individuals to unrestricted travel throughout the United States .  
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
The International Court of Justice has declared in a historic advisory opinion that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be contrary to the rules of international law applicable to armed conflicts .  
Under international humanitarian law applicable in international armed conflicts , in particular article 123 of the Third and article 140 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , this Geneva-based organization is the principal agency authorized to collect all the information it can obtain through official or private channels concerning prisoners of war and protected civilians .  
Such educational material which may necessarily involve detailed information about transmission risks and may be targeted to groups engaging in illegal behaviour , such as injecting drug use and homosexual behaviour , where applicable , should not be wrongfully subject to censorship or obscenity laws or laws making those imparting the information liable for aiding and abetting criminal offences .  
States should review and reform public health legislation to ensure that they adequately address the public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Law 70 / 95 has a wide and generalized range of application , since it is applicable , with no distinction , to any computerized filing system or data bank , both private and public , owned by either a physical or legal person ( art .  1 ) .  
RECOGNIZING the importance of observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights instruments , as well as respect for international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts , and bearing in mind the complementarity between human rights and international humanitarian law in improving protection of the individual and respect for his dignity in situations of armed conflict ,  
Dr Yves Sandoz , Director of International Law and Policy , International Committee of the Red Cross , noted that the starting point of the Workshop was the recognition that protection afforded to the victims of internal violence covered by international humanitarian law was inadequate ; the Workshop was an attempt to escape from the endless debate on the applicability of international law and of human rights instruments in clarifying rules applicable in all situations .  
In this respect , the Special Rapporteur recalls Commission resolutions 1994 / 79 , 1995 / 77 and 1996 / 73 , in which , inter alia , it called upon the Government to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with the instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoyed fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
When the applicable portable tank instruction identified in Column 10 of the Dangerous Goods List and described in 4.2.4.2.6 indicates that bottom openings are prohibited there shall be no openings below the liquid level of the shell when it is filled to its maximum permissible filling limit . 
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
If such an approach was to be adopted , the following alternatives could be considered : to leave it for national conflict-of-laws rules to determine the law applicable to the questions of liability and damages ; to draft a specific uniform conflict-of-laws rule ; or to determine directly which conflict-of-laws rule should be applied ( e.g . , the conflict-of-laws rule of the country in which the certification authority was registered or otherwise authorized to do business ) .  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , is applicable to the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographic and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Calls upon the Government of the Sudan to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with those instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoy fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
The second obstacle was the fallacious and perverse argument that the country was experiencing internally a state of dirty , unconventional war compelling the authorities to suspend the exercise of human rights and to claim , before international forums , that international humanitarian law conventions were not applicable since the situation did not involve an international armed conflict and even less a declared war .  
With regard to the law that is applicable 29 , the commission held that the general principle that emerges , both from national practice and from international custom , is based on the presumption that the non _ fulfilment of a legal obligation is not justified , except to the extent that it may be demonstrated that it is impossible to proceed othewise than in a manner contrary to the law .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level and low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people and the marine environment or does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
All these elements should , in fact , be sought out and thoroughly explored in order to assess objectively whether ( and , eventually , to what extent ) international human rights law is moving beyond the traditional dichotomy of individual versus State , beyond the duty of States to respect and ensure the observance of human rights , and towards the creation of obligations applicable also to private individuals and other non _ State actors , including liberation movements and terrorist organizations .  
The main objective of the study should , in its view , be to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant to particular types or categories of such acts . 
The Working Group took the view that consideration by the Commission of unilateral acts by States , with a view to initiating work on the codification and progressive development of the applicable legal rules , is advisable and feasible , bearing in mind , inter alia , the following reasons : _ In their conduct in the international sphere , States frequently carry out unilateral acts with the intent to produce legal effects . 
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
First , at no stage previously had all the available information on the issue been assembled for comparison and review ; second , no thorough study of the applicable United Nations Staff Rules had been undertaken to assist in the determination of whether the case was one of an actual conflict of interest or rather an apparent conflict of interest reflecting a common-sense application of just and reasonable behaviour ; third , the report must be detailed and legalistic to allow the United Nations to understand the insufficient nature of the current conflict of interest rules .  
In a separate and dissenting opinion concerning the applicability of article 2 of the statute and the grave breaches regime , the Presiding Judge concluded that at all times relevant to the indictment , the armed conflict in the op \ x { eaa1 } ina of Prijedor was international in character , that the victims were protected persons and that article 2 was applicable .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
The coastal State is also given the exclusive right to construct and to authorize and regulate the construction , operation and use of artificial islands.a * The legal status of offshore installations , the legislation applicable to workers thereon , the type of jurisdiction exercised by States over such installations and the possible obligations arising from licensing of the installation for the purposes of exploration and exploitation continue to be of concern to ILO , and work begun on this subject has not yet been completed . 
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
In 1994 , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , the Special Committee had recommended to the Assembly that , in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements in those Territories .

The Rwanda Tribunal is faced with the very difficult task of adjudicating persons responsible for the most egregious crimes imaginable by the human mind : the crime of genocide , crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
Among the measures taken by the Israeli authorities are the allocation of huge funds to change the basic features of Jerusalem and to erase its Arab character and the promulgation of special decrees and laws treating Jerusalem as a purely Israeli zone subject to the same organizational , legal and administrative rules applicable to other Israeli cities .  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
If applicable , assists the Director in preparing methods and procedures for verification of human rights during internal armed confrontation , commitment to strengthening the system for the protection of human rights , commitment relating to security forces and the bearing of arms , military conscription and voluntary nature and behaviour of paramilitary forces ; assists also in following up the verification and evaluating the findings of regional offices . 
The remark was made that the task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
Recalling Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
The representative of the United Kingdom found the original proposal of the representative of South Africa for a new article W acceptable to his delegation , because it maintained the status quo ( i.e . funding of human rights defenders being subject to national legislation consistent with applicable international law ) .  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
Apart from international humanitarian law , Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , whose wording is repeated in the preamble to the draft optional protocol , stipulates : For the purposes of the present Convention , a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Protocols thereto in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , and other pertinent international instruments ;  
Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Protocols thereto in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , and other pertinent international instruments ;  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms into conformity with international law and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment as well as harassment of and threats against human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to the prisons by non _ governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1996 / 114 , mindful of the need for and merit of having a consolidated set of the rules of procedure that are fully applicable to it , decided to entrust Mr . Ribot Hatano with the task of preparing , without financial implications , a working paper relating to the methods of work of the Sub _ Commission , to be submitted to it at its forty _ ninth session as a basis for discussion , which would contain :  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
This definition is applicable to civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , and also to collective or communal rights .  
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
In addition to the comments generally applicable to the holding of awareness days , it is noteworthy that most concerned countries are pursuing efforts to sensitize a wide audience to the issue of combating desertification , not only at the national level but at provincial and local levels as well .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .  
The new constitutional provisions in Finland extended legal protection beyond traditional civil and political rights to economic , social and cultural rights , which are directly applicable in courts of justice and before other authorities .  
Moreover , the rules generally applicable to reservations were sufficiently flexible and adaptable to be applied with equal authority in the case of human rights and other normative treaties and should not be revised .  
In its advisory opinion , the Court ruled that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the international law applicable to armed conflict and , in particular , the principles and rules of humanitarian law .  
Other examples included an ad hoc tribunal to investigate allegations of improper supply or prescription of dangerous drugs and a national reference laboratory to undertake research on controlled substances and the applicable international controls .  
It should be designed to meet critical urgent needs , as well as the long-term requirements essential for the development of a sustainable national / local capacity , when applicable .  
In many respects , those conditions did not meet contemporary international standards in the field of human rights or the requirements of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 , which the General Assembly had determined was applicable to the occupied territories . 
National plans of action for human rights education , which have been called for both by the General Assembly and the Commission , are intended to be an integral part of the national development plan ( when applicable ) and be complementary to other relevant national plans of action already defined ( general human rights plans of action or those relating to women , children , minorities , indigenous peoples , etc . ) .  
Even if the case results in the summary dismissal of a staff member , the evidence may not be sufficient to satisfy the standard of proof applicable in criminal matters considered by national courts .  
The guarantor or issuer is not entitled to withhold payment on the ground that there has in fact been no failure to perform under the main contract ; however , under the law applicable to the instrument , payment may in very exceptional and narrowly defined circumstances be refused or restrained ( e.g . when the claim by the beneficiary is manifestly fraudulent ) .  
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
In a country torn by an internal armed conflict to which international humanitarian law is applicable , an official is dismissed .  
As to the exact way in which the notion of an accessory right might be expressed in paragraph ( 1 ) , while the concern was expressed that the second set of bracketed language might be circular , it was agreed that it was preferable , since it left the question of the accessory or independent nature of the security right to law applicable outside the draft Convention .  
The main principles agreed upon at that time were that international law , including the Charter of the United Nations , would be applicable to outer space and celestial bodies , and that outer space and celestial bodies were free for exploration and use by all States in conformity with international law and were not subject to national appropriation .  
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
Also reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
The entire illegal parallel educational system is organized outside the existing system , contrary to the applicable curricula , so that data regarding the number of schools and pupils are inaccessible .  
IS1.2 All revenue from staff assessment not otherwise disposed of by specific resolution of the General Assembly is credited to the Tax Equalization Fund established by the Assembly in its resolution 973 A ( X ) of 15 December 1955 .  Member States are given credit in that Fund in accordance with the scale of assessments for the regular budget applicable to the financial year concerned .  
Also reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Such a categorical rejection would create more confusion in respect of the applicable law in case of actual damage or harm occurring across international borders or at the global level because of activities pursued or permitted by States within their territory or other areas under their exclusive jurisdiction and control .  
Its activities may include monitoring compliance with specific rights recognized under the Covenant and providing reports thereon to the public authorities and civil society , and examining complaints alleging infringements of applicable economic , social and cultural rights standards within the State .  
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its decision 1996 / 114 , mindful of the need for and merit of having a consolidated set of the rules of procedure that are fully applicable to it , decided to entrust Mr . Ribot Hatano with the task of preparing , without financial implications , a working paper relating to the methods of work of the Sub _ Commission , to be submitted to it at its forty _ ninth session as a basis for discussion , which would contain :  
First to re-assert our right to self-determination , which we have demonstrated to you is firmly based on the political and legal rights applicable to all Non-Self-Governing Territories on the United Nations list as established by United Nations resolutions and Covenants and international law as determined by the International Court of Justice . . . . 
Consistency with current international law requires that the child be defined as every human being below the age of eighteen years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier ( article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) ) .  
Another discriminatory legal doctrine that appears to be widespread is the doctrine that States have practically unlimited power to control or regulate the use of indigenous lands , without regard for constitutional limits on governmental power that would otherwise be applicable . 
Suitable gratis personnel would be selected and accepted subject to the regime applicable to gratis personnel as established by the General Assembly and subsequent administrative issuances , including the conclusion of a standard agreement with donor countries .  
At this point , the Special Rapporteur is prepared to offer , first , some general conclusions applicable to the issues of the study as a whole ; and then to provide more specific conclusions regarding the two main categories of currently existing situations in which indigenous peoples live in multi _ national societies : those in which treaties , agreements or other constructive arrangements exist , and those lacking such juridical instruments .  
As a result of his research , the Special Rapporteur has ample proof that indigenous peoples / nations who have entertained treaty relationships with non-indigenous settlers and their continuators strongly argue that those instruments not only continue to be valid and applicable to their situation today but are a key element for their survival as distinct peoples .  
The content of adequacy is to some extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , but there are some core elements which are applicable under all circumstances and are spelled out in greater detail by the Committee .  
The problem was that , according to the normal understanding , where an obligation was breached and the exhaustion rule applied , the applicable international law was the law applicable at the time the harm was done and not at the time the local remedies were exhausted ; indeed it was difficult to specify that time because of the different ways in which local remedies could be exhausted .  
The States parties to the present Covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and , when applicable , legal guardians to choose for their children schools , other than those established by the public authorities , which conform to such minimum educational standards as may be laid down or approved by the State and to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions .  
The general principles are that : ( a ) in order to be both financially viable and of sufficient quality for simultaneous interpretation , communications for remote interpretation require the use of ISDN lines for the transmission of both audio and video ; and ( b ) under the International Standards Organization standards applicable to simultaneous interpretation equipment , the minimum sound bandwidth acceptable for interpretation purposes is 12.5 kHz .  
Under this Act , foreign legislation which is aimed , directly or indirectly , at restricting or impeding the free flow of trade and the movement of capital , goods or persons to the detriment of a given country or group of countries shall neither be applicable nor have legal effects of any kind within the national territory .  
Training was not in principle meant to be awarded for the pursuit of academic studies leading to degrees or diplomas , but rather to give qualified persons the opportunity to extend their professional or technical knowledge and experience to areas applicable to future seabed mining and to acquaint them with advanced methods and techniques used by registered pioneer investors .  
Several Member States described criminal provisions that addressed bodily injury , noting that they were also applicable to some harmful traditional practices , such as female genital mutilation .  
Distressed by the widespread violation of the principle of non-refoulement and of the rights of refugees and recalling that asylum applicants should have access to fair and expeditious status-determination procedures , the Assembly encouraged States that had not already done so to consider acceding to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and to other relevant refugee instruments , as applicable , and to relevant international human rights instruments .  
He outlined the legal issues that needed to be resolved before the undertaking of actual proceedings , including the definition of applicable laws , both national and international , and procedural questions such as the appointment of personnel , the mechanism for appeals and the requirements for evidence .  
In the absence of minimal harmonization at the international level , national laws applicable through conflicts rules might thus impose extremely harsh standards that could potentially affect the growth and the global availability of electronic commerce techniques .  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;  
By working closely with States , UNHCR can ensure that the fundamental principles underlying its mandate and international instruments applicable in refugee situations will be upheld , and we can begin to reverse the disturbing trends of discrimination , xenophobia and closed borders on the one hand , while addressing issues of illegal immigration , trafficking and asylum abuse , on the other . 
In addition , it was pointed out that draft article 27 could be deleted , since it addressed the contractual aspects of assignment , namely a matter which was not the main focus of the draft Convention and might already be sufficiently regulated by private international law ( even though the principle of freedom of choice of the applicable law might not be common to all legal systems ) .  
The final status of the concerned territories will later be determined through delimitation and demarcation ( based on colonial treaties and applicable international law ) , processes that are completely separate from the restoration of the status quo ante .  
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
The above law is applicable both to the public and private sectors , and , apart from defining the concept of indirect discrimination , it establishes that discriminatory practices occur when there is a considerable disproportion between the number of male and female workers .  
Similarly , the rules of the multilateral financial institutions , implicit in the conditionalities of the IMF and the World Bank , which are applicable only to deficit countries or borrowing countries , should be reshaped so that the standardized package of policies , which is inflexible , is not imposed on countries , irrespective of time and space , particularly where some of its elements are not consistent with national development objectives in the long term .

Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
Apart from international humanitarian law , Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , whose wording is repeated in the preamble to the draft optional protocol , stipulates : For the purposes of the present Convention , a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;

At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1996 / 114 , mindful of the need for and merit of having a consolidated set of the rules of procedure that are fully applicable to it , decided to entrust Mr . Ribot Hatano with the task of preparing , without financial implications , a working paper relating to the methods of work of the Sub _ Commission , to be submitted to it at its forty _ ninth session as a basis for discussion , which would contain :  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
This definition is applicable to civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , and also to collective or communal rights .  
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
In addition to the comments generally applicable to the holding of awareness days , it is noteworthy that most concerned countries are pursuing efforts to sensitize a wide audience to the issue of combating desertification , not only at the national level but at provincial and local levels as well .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .  
The new constitutional provisions in Finland extended legal protection beyond traditional civil and political rights to economic , social and cultural rights , which are directly applicable in courts of justice and before other authorities .  
Moreover , the rules generally applicable to reservations were sufficiently flexible and adaptable to be applied with equal authority in the case of human rights and other normative treaties and should not be revised .  
In its advisory opinion , the Court ruled that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the international law applicable to armed conflict and , in particular , the principles and rules of humanitarian law .  
Other examples included an ad hoc tribunal to investigate allegations of improper supply or prescription of dangerous drugs and a national reference laboratory to undertake research on controlled substances and the applicable international controls .  
It should be designed to meet critical urgent needs , as well as the long-term requirements essential for the development of a sustainable national / local capacity , when applicable .  
In many respects , those conditions did not meet contemporary international standards in the field of human rights or the requirements of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 , which the General Assembly had determined was applicable to the occupied territories . 
National plans of action for human rights education , which have been called for both by the General Assembly and the Commission , are intended to be an integral part of the national development plan ( when applicable ) and be complementary to other relevant national plans of action already defined ( general human rights plans of action or those relating to women , children , minorities , indigenous peoples , etc . ) .  
Even if the case results in the summary dismissal of a staff member , the evidence may not be sufficient to satisfy the standard of proof applicable in criminal matters considered by national courts .  
The guarantor or issuer is not entitled to withhold payment on the ground that there has in fact been no failure to perform under the main contract ; however , under the law applicable to the instrument , payment may in very exceptional and narrowly defined circumstances be refused or restrained ( e.g . when the claim by the beneficiary is manifestly fraudulent ) .  
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
In a country torn by an internal armed conflict to which international humanitarian law is applicable , an official is dismissed .  
As to the exact way in which the notion of an accessory right might be expressed in paragraph ( 1 ) , while the concern was expressed that the second set of bracketed language might be circular , it was agreed that it was preferable , since it left the question of the accessory or independent nature of the security right to law applicable outside the draft Convention .

The entire illegal parallel educational system is organized outside the existing system , contrary to the applicable curricula , so that data regarding the number of schools and pupils are inaccessible .  
IS1.2 All revenue from staff assessment not otherwise disposed of by specific resolution of the General Assembly is credited to the Tax Equalization Fund established by the Assembly in its resolution 973 A ( X ) of 15 December 1955 .

Such a categorical rejection would create more confusion in respect of the applicable law in case of actual damage or harm occurring across international borders or at the global level because of activities pursued or permitted by States within their territory or other areas under their exclusive jurisdiction and control .  
Its activities may include monitoring compliance with specific rights recognized under the Covenant and providing reports thereon to the public authorities and civil society , and examining complaints alleging infringements of applicable economic , social and cultural rights standards within the State .  
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its decision 1996 / 114 , mindful of the need for and merit of having a consolidated set of the rules of procedure that are fully applicable to it , decided to entrust Mr .

First to re-assert our right to self-determination , which we have demonstrated to you is firmly based on the political and legal rights applicable to all Non-Self-Governing Territories on the United Nations list as established by United Nations resolutions and Covenants and international law as determined by the International Court of Justice . . . . 
Consistency with current international law requires that the child be defined as every human being below the age of eighteen years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier ( article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) ) .  
Another discriminatory legal doctrine that appears to be widespread is the doctrine that States have practically unlimited power to control or regulate the use of indigenous lands , without regard for constitutional limits on governmental power that would otherwise be applicable . 
Suitable gratis personnel would be selected and accepted subject to the regime applicable to gratis personnel as established by the General Assembly and subsequent administrative issuances , including the conclusion of a standard agreement with donor countries .  
At this point , the Special Rapporteur is prepared to offer , first , some general conclusions applicable to the issues of the study as a whole ; and then to provide more specific conclusions regarding the two main categories of currently existing situations in which indigenous peoples live in multi _ national societies : those in which treaties , agreements or other constructive arrangements exist , and those lacking such juridical instruments .  
As a result of his research , the Special Rapporteur has ample proof that indigenous peoples / nations who have entertained treaty relationships with non-indigenous settlers and their continuators strongly argue that those instruments not only continue to be valid and applicable to their situation today but are a key element for their survival as distinct peoples .  
The content of adequacy is to some extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , but there are some core elements which are applicable under all circumstances and are spelled out in greater detail by the Committee .  
The problem was that , according to the normal understanding , where an obligation was breached and the exhaustion rule applied , the applicable international law was the law applicable at the time the harm was done and not at the time the local remedies were exhausted ; indeed it was difficult to specify that time because of the different ways in which local remedies could be exhausted .  
The States parties to the present Covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and , when applicable , legal guardians to choose for their children schools , other than those established by the public authorities , which conform to such minimum educational standards as may be laid down or approved by the State and to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions .  
The general principles are that : ( a ) in order to be both financially viable and of sufficient quality for simultaneous interpretation , communications for remote interpretation require the use of ISDN lines for the transmission of both audio and video ; and ( b ) under the International Standards Organization standards applicable to simultaneous interpretation equipment , the minimum sound bandwidth acceptable for interpretation purposes is 12.5 kHz .

Training was not in principle meant to be awarded for the pursuit of academic studies leading to degrees or diplomas , but rather to give qualified persons the opportunity to extend their professional or technical knowledge and experience to areas applicable to future seabed mining and to acquaint them with advanced methods and techniques used by registered pioneer investors .  
Several Member States described criminal provisions that addressed bodily injury , noting that they were also applicable to some harmful traditional practices , such as female genital mutilation .  
Distressed by the widespread violation of the principle of non-refoulement and of the rights of refugees and recalling that asylum applicants should have access to fair and expeditious status-determination procedures , the Assembly encouraged States that had not already done so to consider acceding to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and to other relevant refugee instruments , as applicable , and to relevant international human rights instruments .  
He outlined the legal issues that needed to be resolved before the undertaking of actual proceedings , including the definition of applicable laws , both national and international , and procedural questions such as the appointment of personnel , the mechanism for appeals and the requirements for evidence .

By working closely with States , UNHCR can ensure that the fundamental principles underlying its mandate and international instruments applicable in refugee situations will be upheld , and we can begin to reverse the disturbing trends of discrimination , xenophobia and closed borders on the one hand , while addressing issues of illegal immigration , trafficking and asylum abuse , on the other . 
In addition , it was pointed out that draft article 27 could be deleted , since it addressed the contractual aspects of assignment , namely a matter which was not the main focus of the draft Convention and might already be sufficiently regulated by private international law ( even though the principle of freedom of choice of the applicable law might not be common to all legal systems ) .  
The final status of the concerned territories will later be determined through delimitation and demarcation ( based on colonial treaties and applicable international law ) , processes that are completely separate from the restoration of the status quo ante .  
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
The above law is applicable both to the public and private sectors , and , apart from defining the concept of indirect discrimination , it establishes that discriminatory practices occur when there is a considerable disproportion between the number of male and female workers .  
Similarly , the rules of the multilateral financial institutions , implicit in the conditionalities of the IMF and the World Bank , which are applicable only to deficit countries or borrowing countries , should be reshaped so that the standardized package of policies , which is inflexible , is not imposed on countries , irrespective of time and space , particularly where some of its elements are not consistent with national development objectives in the long term .  
The objective of this Protocol is to establish a preventive visiting mechanism to examine the treatment of persons [ deprived of their liberty ] [ detained ] with a view to recommending means for strengthening , if necessary , the protection of such persons from torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment [ as defined under international law applicable to the State Party ] [ and relevant international standards ] .  
Each State Party shall review its declaration ( s ) under article 2 on an annual basis , with a view to the possibility of increasing the minimum age that it applies for the voluntary enlistment of persons into its national armed forces and for the participation of such persons in armed conflict , and shall deposit any declaration ( s ) accepting higher standards when applicable .  
In the strict sense outlined above , the rule of law does not exist as a crime control mechanism at the international level . 3 There is no international legislation that creates conventional offences and criminal procedures applicable to individuals in the same sense as domestic criminal laws do .  
His country shared the view that the legal regime currently applicable to outer space could not guarantee the prevention of an arms race in outer space , and it was therefore imperative to adopt new measures with adequate and effective verifying provisions .  
In order to address that lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , of which five major situations had been identified , it would be useful to identify and draw upon international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , applicable at all times , to all circumstances and to all actors , both governmental and non-governmental , as well as any individual .  
ICRC suggested that many purposes could be envisaged : a document meant to facilitate the dissemination of the relevant norms , an instrument aimed at clarifying the substance of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflict , a text aimed at clarifying the responsibility of non-State actors , or a document aimed at bridging the gap ( if one existed ) between international humanitarian law and human rights law in situations of internal violence .  
In its resolution 1998 / 33 , the Commission decided , as part of its efforts to impart a higher visibility to economic , social and cultural rights , to appoint , for a period of three years , a special rapporteur whose mandate would focus on the right to education , as laid down in article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the relevant and applicable provisions of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .

By working closely with States , UNHCR can ensure that the fundamental principles underlying its mandate and international instruments applicable in refugee situations will be upheld , and we can begin to reverse the disturbing trends of discrimination , xenophobia and closed borders on the one hand , while addressing issues of illegal immigration , trafficking and asylum abuse , on the other .

Ecuador attaches the utmost importance to the Ottawa Convention , because we are convinced that it strengthens and improves upon the principles of international humanitarian law that are applicable to armed conflict , consolidates respect for disarmament conventions , especially those relating to controls on conventional arms that have especially harmful and indiscriminate effects , and , in particular , fosters and strengthens peace .  
The Commission urges support , upon the request of the State concerned , for national efforts to gain greater access to resource information and to develop appropriate policies to facilitate the exploration and exploitation , with the States consent and in a manner consistent with the sustainability of marine living resources , of non-living marine resources within its exclusive economic zones , or to the outer limits of the continental shelf , wherever applicable .
