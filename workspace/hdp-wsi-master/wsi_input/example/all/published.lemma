Since Dr . Joseph Needham decided in 1938 to write a systematic . objective and authoritative history of science in China , the Cambridge University Press has published no less than seven large volumes of his Science and Civilisation in China comprising within them some fifteen books . Having devoted his life to cultivating this project over more than half a century , Needham is still applying his astonishing perseverance to the process of writing his long-awaited conclusion .  
The activities of his life after that time have been rather like a search to prove the truth of this ideal . Of course the idea of a global family is a beautiful one , but Needham 's mission to prove the scientific merits of Chinese culture could not live comfortably with the arrogant idea of Western superiority that had come down from the seventeenth century . When the first volume of Science and Civilisation in China was published in 1954 , Needham 's humanistic aspirations were still confronted by two established bodies of opinion .  
After current publisher Shaw Yu-ming assumed office , in 1987 Sinorama 's global vision was broadened and coverage of Chinese cultural traditions was strengthened . Series of reports on world sinology and sinologists , on famous universities , and other subjects appeared , and have already been collected and published in book form .  
As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "  
" Star " level personalities with attractive faces and sleek bodies would cooperate with a professional photographer to produce a series of carefully calculated shots . These would be published as " personal albums " wrapped in clear plastic ( they could only be thumbed through after purchase ) , and provided as products for the enjoyment of movie stars ' and singers ' fans .  
At the end of the Ching dynasty , with the failure of the 100 Days Reform , the reformist royalist protectors Kang Yu-wei and Liang Chi-chao , both Cantonese , fled abroad . They published newspapers and established schools for the overseas Chinese in all kinds of places , stirring up patriotic thinking . It was only then that the Overseas Chinese began to identify with their country and became enthusiastic about politics .  
An unnecessary luxuryIn the early years of the Republic of China , the famous author Lu Hsun , in a short story entitled " The Blessing " ( " Chu Fu " ) , published in his anthology Indecision ( " P'aihuai " ) , satirized a modern youth who scorned the characters of the feudal age , yet longed for " Fuhsing Lou Restaurant 's shark fin simmered in clear broth , a dollar a serving , cheap and tasty - - is it still so cheap ?  
Twelve years ago the first book in the ROC to promote ecological conservation , We Only Have One Earth , was published . From that time until today , a rich selection of publications focusing on the natural environment has been produced in Taiwan , following the progressive development of environmental consciousness here . Recently a publishing house has even been established specializing in books about nature .  
In his university days , Liu Chao-neng took part in a social club at Chung-Yuan Christian University which published a magazine , and he helped organize a Logical Thinking Camp and an Environmental Living Camp . He also studied legislative procedure , joined in the student movement and demonstrated against the aging " perpetual parliamentarians " then still in office .  
According to Craig Clunas , " Those early visitors to China who , unlike their merchant contemporaries , managed to penetrate the homes of the elite , were struck by the relative bareness and lack of decorative surfaces within the elegant Chinese interior . " In 1696 the Jesuit Father Louis Le Comte published his memoirs of his travels in China in which he remarked that the Chinese use hand-painted silk hangings or glued paper on the walls .  
The report that was published at the time clearly stated the entire range of the site , and furthermore requested relevant units to " quickly plan preservation of certain areas and designate them protected historical landmarks . "  
According to Turtles of the World , which was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1989 , excessive culling , along with highway construction in developed countries , is a main reason turtle and tortoise populations are now facing a general crisis . In particular , the trade in turtles as meat and pets is booming as never before . With tortoises and turtles of large and small species alike being adopted as pets or turned into culinary delicacies , there 's no way for these chelonians to fulfill their duty of passing on their genetic legacy .  
Wei recalls that he started reading the magazine in his freshman year at college , before people were free to speak as they pleased , yet the magazine was very bold about what it published . The historical documents were more stimulating and comprehensive than his formal history education at university .  
Winston Peters ' polemics about Asians have been reported to human rights organizations , and the Race Relations Office has not only expressed " concern , " but even published a full-page advertisement picturing four brains , of which three , of equal size , were labelled " Pakeha , " " Maori " and " Asian , " while the fourth , much smaller brain was labelled " Racist . "  
In The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990 , Porter advanced the now famous " Porter 's Diamond , " a four-sided framework in which the vague concept of competitive advantage is turned into something clear and concrete . From organizations as small as a single company to those as large as a nation , the basic forces at work in shaping competitive advantage are herein clearly exposed .  
As one author puts it with complete confidence in a book published only a few years ago , when the gates of China were forced open in the nineteenth century , " the dreadful truth leaked out : the scale of the gardens of the mandarins compared to their equivalents in England rather as the bonsai does to the beech . " With such a world of difference between the Chinese and the English garden , the two should not be spoken of in the same breath . Mountain buildings , myriad torrents  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
In the second year of the Jiaqing reign period ( 1796-1821 ) of the Qing , Hong Chaohe began publishing his Popular Almanac for Bringing Out [ Auspiciousness ] and Avoiding [ Misfortune ] . The almanac showed outstanding calculating capability , being comparable to the official version , published shortly after Hong 's , in defining the traditional 24 " solar periods " ( climatic stages of the year ) . Hong 's work was very well-received .  
A book published in mainland China notes that Zhang Guolao 's habit of riding backwards on a donkey provides a striking illustration of the spirit it takes to become an immortal . Anyone who would become an immortal must turn his back on worldly ambition and look with disdain upon authority . Riding backwards and not even bothering to scan the road ahead , Zhang Guolao 's whole lifestyle represented a noble but sad protest against mainstream society . In so doing , he concentrated his life forces and vaulted into the ranks of the immortals .  
The most novel interpretation of the tales of love between immortals and regular human beings appears in a book published in Taiwan , in which the author argues that the denizens of heaven are sapped of their sex drive by perpetually fair weather , beautiful clothing , delectable food , and centuries of living at a metabolic rate of zero .  
Amidst the excitement and fury of a new tide of literary activity , 26-year-old Wang Anyi published The Falling Rain , a romantic short story about Wenwen walking through the rain in hopes of running across a boy she had once happened to meet . According to Sung Ju-shan , " Under the communist regime , with its stress on historical materialism , no one had ever before published a story that focused on the emotions of an adolescent girl .  
In 1978 , the legislative elections were canceled after the US announced it would switch diplomatic ties to the PRC . Many in the opposition camp ( represented by the newly published magazine Formosa ) favored working for change through street demonstrations , as opposed to the traditionally safer line of " reform through the system . " On December 10 , 1979 , the Kaohsiung riot occurred , and most of Formosa 's leaders were imprisoned . Democratization and the multi-party system were thus postponed .  
These are some of the main arguments that constitute Lin 's 1988 book China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy , which is now available for the first time in a Taiwan translation in Lin 's recently published The Nuclear Hegemon . Although China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy was published back in 1988 , it is still very enlightening for readers today to find out how Communist China 's nuclear weapons strategy is very much tied to Chinese strategic tradition . Anyone studying Communist China 's military can not ignore the influence of traditional strategic culture .  
" Historical truth " is of course a fascinating topic of its own . While Biographical Literature has had an unmatched impact on contemporary historians , on popular interest in history , and in capturing the flavor of the past , there is at least one point worth wondering about : It has rarely published any material about Taiwan over the last 50 years , such as the stories of the opposition movement or of well-connected families like the Lins or Koos .  
Author Chang Ta-chun holds a master 's degree in Chinese literature from Fu Jen Catholic University , where he is a lecturer in the Department of Chinese Literature . With his series of books published under the pen-name " Big-Head Chun , " he established an irreverent and satirical realist style ; his subsequent works The Lying Disciple and No One Writes to the Colonel , which combine topical news stories with imaginary scenarios , elicited a broad response and gave rise to much controversy .  
A number of Chinese authors have risen to fame in recent years with books published in English , including Nien Cheng , Amy Tan , Jung Chang , and Ha Jin . Now Adeline Yen Mah has joined the list with Falling Leaves : The True Story of an Unwanted Chinese Daughter . This autobiographical account focuses especially on the author 's childhood years growing up in a wealthy but abusive family in China during a time of political upheaval .  
An article published in 1932 by the Association for Promoting Taiwan 's Scenic Beauty describes the rigors of the road building task . In places the rock was very hard and highly fragmented , making it unsuitable for blasting with gunpowder . " Police squad leader Shibata tied a thick rope around his body and had himself lowered down the mountainside like a bottle on a string . First he cut a foothold wide enough to stand on with one foot , and then gradually enlarged it . "  
Most media and commentators have been positive toward the little three links . In an article published on December 25 , the United Daily News declared that , given the trend of economic globalization , the opening of the three links across the Taiwan Strait should bring unprecedented growth in cross-strait economic ties . In addition , promoting economic links is something that both sides find acceptable despite the frigid nature of the political relationship .  
Says Lin , " Because of the way the pieces are selected and the fact that most online readers are students , almost all the online works that get published in book format offer very realistic descriptions of school romance . I think these novels give young authors a chance to achieve a sense of closure in real-life romances gone wrong , and to use their experiences as a source of creative energy . " Lin feels that the popularity of such works is natural , since both the authors and readers are everyday people .  
The patient at the center of the story , Chou Chin-yao , eventually published an account of the incident entitled A Skin Graft with Love ( 1984 ) . " Each time I recall the extraordinary grace that Dr . and Mrs . Landsborough bestowed on one so sick , it brings me to tears , even though half a century has passed since then . Words can not describe the intensity of my gratitude .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
Also , in line with the general trend in education reform toward diversification of teaching materials , the integrated curriculum not only abolishes the current requirement for junior high schools to use the standard textbooks published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation , allowing them to use any approved textbook instead , but it also allows county and city governments , schools , and teachers to produce their own teaching materials , and particularly encourages schools to form " curriculum development committees " to devise course content .  
With regard to copyrighted imports such as newspapers , magazines , recordings and books , Chao explains that everything that has research value ( whether the copyright is held by an individual or an organization ) can be imported . Books and recordings of a cultural nature can likewise be published in Taiwan , so long as applications are filled and sensitive passages amended . But news-oriented newspapers and magazines from the mainland can not be published or sold here .  
Yang then fell upon hard times , and had to scrounge for a living playing in bars . Cheng Heng-lung , who together with his wife Kuo Li-chuan recently published a book about Taiwanese music , recalls that Yang San-lang was deeply distressed not only about his own fate , but also about the demise of Taiwanese-language music : " Yang had no one to turn to . He once broke down and cried before me . " It is a sad story , but Yang 's uncompromising love for his art inspires nothing but respect .  
In the broad sense , an electronic book , or e-book , means published content that is stored in the form of digital data on any kind of electronic storage media , such as a hard disk , floppy disk , optical disk or IC card , and transmitted through a data network to the user 's digital reading equipment , such as a PC , notebook , PDA or even a mobile phone .  
Chu Bong-foo says he first conceived Cosmic Drifter in 1998 . The ideas came from his previously published Nine Essays On Intelligence , in which he discusses thought , human nature and value in terms of energy conversion , the formation of matter , the nature of time and space , and the evolution of the universe . But the essays ' content was dry and dull , and nobody understood it . Therefore he wanted to turn his theories into a popular novel that ordinary people would understand .  
In fact , in a survey carried out two years ago by the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation and National Tsing Hua University , almost 40% of fish sampled from food markets contained excessive levels of " persistent organic pollutants , " which are likely to act as environmental hormones . However , following angry protests from fishermen after the report was published , no action was taken .  
To provide guidance for future legislation , I have begun collating a compendium of local and foreign academic writings , legislation and court rulings relevant to transgender rights . With regard to the protection of homosexuals ' rights , I recently published a monograph entitled On Equal Protection for Lesbians and Gay Men , which I hope interested readers will read for themselves .  
In recent years , annual reports published by American and European business associations based in Taipei have focused on the key question of opening the " three links , " shorthand for resuming normal trade , transportation , and mail routes with mainland China , and other cross-strait economic and trade policy . In fact , this issue has caused a number of foreign manufacturers to close their operations in Taiwan and to relocate to mainland China .  
Immediately after the war , Lung Ying-tsung edited the literature section of the Japanese-language China Daily and published a collection of informal essays entitled The Lonely Bookworm in Japanese . In this post-war period , he also wrote Qingtian Bairi Qi , a novel that describes the innermost feelings of Taiwanese youth welcoming the end of Japanese rule , and A Man from Swatow , which depicts the inner conflicts and sense of original sin felt by Taiwanese during the war . Lung withdrew from Taiwan 's literary circles in the 1950s .  
The situation is quite different in mainland China , where it is common for writers-both the famous and the unheralded-to have the same piece published some dozen times in publications large and small around the country . Relative to the cost of living , the writing fees there are quite ample , and writers who produce enough work should definitely be able to make a living off their writing . Under the circumstances , the publishing industry has tremendous potential and should move in the direction of the European and American models .  
Under the old system of economic planning , the distribution of published works in the mainland was all handled through a single state-owned channel ( known as the " first channel " ) - every region in the country had a Xinhua bookstore and supply unit . These Xinhua stores held sole control of delivery and distribution , a system entirely inappropriate for a free market .  
The established publication and distribution mechanism could n't keep up with the needs of the market or with the changing face of the industry . Now the mainland publishing industry is overburdened upstream and overwhelmed downstream : the production of published works is like a torrential river rushing to the ocean-but on reaching the estuary ( distribution channels ) , it can do no more than trickle in . Some merges into the " second channel , " while the rest overflows everywhere , unable to smoothly enter the ocean that is the literary market .  
True , these books may sell far less than the dazzling numbers pulled in by the best-sellers , but look at it another way . In terms of the total amount published , this steady , solid flow of books coming in from the mainland is already making serious incursions into the literary mass market .  
In March 2003 the Chinese edition of Scientific American magazine published an article entitled " Suicide : Why Do They Do It ? , " which pointed out that research by American scientists has shown that a type of neurotransmitter in the brain-serotonin-is related to emotional stability in humans , and that people suffering from depression who exhibit aggressive behavior , as well as people with compulsive and obsessive personalities , have lower levels of serotonin than normal people .  
When resources were short and a good number of books were forbidden , it was the second-hand book market that helped spread knowledge , and reading was considered more important than collecting . Today there are up to 400,000 new books published a year , so why do people still want to collect old books ? " It 's because the sheer volume of books being published is huge , it 's like a sea of books out there .  
In September of last year , Dr . Lin , who had for a long time focused her research on blood groups and ethnic groups , published the results of a study entitled " Correlation between SARS virus infection and the human leukocyte antigen . " Lin concluded that there is a direct connection between the presence of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B46 and the severity of a SARS infection . She found that ethnic southern Chinese who

The success of these policies will largely depend on political developments , but the availability of considerable IMF funding , subject to conditionality and close monitoring , may help to keep them on track , despite increasing popular protests against reforms in the run-up to the presidential elections in June . The projected growth rate for 1996 in the medium-term strategy is 2.3 per cent , but none of the variant forecasts made by the Ministry of the Economy , published in January , show positive GDP growth in 1996 .

The Marre Report on the Future of the English legal profession , published in 1988 , stated that " It is extremely difficult to define the need for legal services .  Unmet need is impossible to quantify . . .  It would be hard to develop research techniques which would give a reliable profile of unmet legal need broken down by type of problem and geographical area " .  
A comprehensive set of published laws , coupled with a stable and transparent legal system , are fundamental to investors ' confidence .

Since Dr . Joseph Needham decided in 1938 to write a systematic . objective and authoritative history of science in China , the Cambridge University Press has published no less than seven large volumes of his Science and Civilisation in China comprising within them some fifteen books . Having devoted his life to cultivating this project over more than half a century , Needham is still applying his astonishing perseverance to the process of writing his long-awaited conclusion .  
The activities of his life after that time have been rather like a search to prove the truth of this ideal . Of course the idea of a global family is a beautiful one , but Needham 's mission to prove the scientific merits of Chinese culture could not live comfortably with the arrogant idea of Western superiority that had come down from the seventeenth century . When the first volume of Science and Civilisation in China was published in 1954 , Needham 's humanistic aspirations were still confronted by two established bodies of opinion .  
After current publisher Shaw Yu-ming assumed office , in 1987 Sinorama 's global vision was broadened and coverage of Chinese cultural traditions was strengthened . Series of reports on world sinology and sinologists , on famous universities , and other subjects appeared , and have already been collected and published in book form .  
As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "

At the end of the Ching dynasty , with the failure of the 100 Days Reform , the reformist royalist protectors Kang Yu-wei and Liang Chi-chao , both Cantonese , fled abroad . They published newspapers and established schools for the overseas Chinese in all kinds of places , stirring up patriotic thinking . It was only then that the Overseas Chinese began to identify with their country and became enthusiastic about politics .  
An unnecessary luxuryIn the early years of the Republic of China , the famous author Lu Hsun , in a short story entitled " The Blessing " ( " Chu Fu " ) , published in his anthology Indecision ( " P'aihuai " ) , satirized a modern youth who scorned the characters of the feudal age , yet longed for " Fuhsing Lou Restaurant 's shark fin simmered in clear broth , a dollar a serving , cheap and tasty - - is it still so cheap ?  
Twelve years ago the first book in the ROC to promote ecological conservation , We Only Have One Earth , was published . From that time until today , a rich selection of publications focusing on the natural environment has been produced in Taiwan , following the progressive development of environmental consciousness here . Recently a publishing house has even been established specializing in books about nature .  
In his university days , Liu Chao-neng took part in a social club at Chung-Yuan Christian University which published a magazine , and he helped organize a Logical Thinking Camp and an Environmental Living Camp . He also studied legislative procedure , joined in the student movement and demonstrated against the aging " perpetual parliamentarians " then still in office .  
According to Craig Clunas , " Those early visitors to China who , unlike their merchant contemporaries , managed to penetrate the homes of the elite , were struck by the relative bareness and lack of decorative surfaces within the elegant Chinese interior . " In 1696 the Jesuit Father Louis Le Comte published his memoirs of his travels in China in which he remarked that the Chinese use hand-painted silk hangings or glued paper on the walls .  
The report that was published at the time clearly stated the entire range of the site , and furthermore requested relevant units to " quickly plan preservation of certain areas and designate them protected historical landmarks . "  
According to Turtles of the World , which was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1989 , excessive culling , along with highway construction in developed countries , is a main reason turtle and tortoise populations are now facing a general crisis . In particular , the trade in turtles as meat and pets is booming as never before . With tortoises and turtles of large and small species alike being adopted as pets or turned into culinary delicacies , there 's no way for these chelonians to fulfill their duty of passing on their genetic legacy .  
Wei recalls that he started reading the magazine in his freshman year at college , before people were free to speak as they pleased , yet the magazine was very bold about what it published . The historical documents were more stimulating and comprehensive than his formal history education at university .  
Winston Peters ' polemics about Asians have been reported to human rights organizations , and the Race Relations Office has not only expressed " concern , " but even published a full-page advertisement picturing four brains , of which three , of equal size , were labelled " Pakeha , " " Maori " and " Asian , " while the fourth , much smaller brain was labelled " Racist . "  
In The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990 , Porter advanced the now famous " Porter 's Diamond , " a four-sided framework in which the vague concept of competitive advantage is turned into something clear and concrete .

As one author puts it with complete confidence in a book published only a few years ago , when the gates of China were forced open in the nineteenth century , " the dreadful truth leaked out : the scale of the gardens of the mandarins compared to their equivalents in England rather as the bonsai does to the beech . " With such a world of difference between the Chinese and the English garden , the two should not be spoken of in the same breath . Mountain buildings , myriad torrents  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
In the second year of the Jiaqing reign period ( 1796-1821 ) of the Qing , Hong Chaohe began publishing his Popular Almanac for Bringing Out [ Auspiciousness ] and Avoiding [ Misfortune ] .

Hong 's work was very well-received .  
A book published in mainland China notes that Zhang Guolao 's habit of riding backwards on a donkey provides a striking illustration of the spirit it takes to become an immortal . Anyone who would become an immortal must turn his back on worldly ambition and look with disdain upon authority . Riding backwards and not even bothering to scan the road ahead , Zhang Guolao 's whole lifestyle represented a noble but sad protest against mainstream society . In so doing , he concentrated his life forces and vaulted into the ranks of the immortals .  
The most novel interpretation of the tales of love between immortals and regular human beings appears in a book published in Taiwan , in which the author argues that the denizens of heaven are sapped of their sex drive by perpetually fair weather , beautiful clothing , delectable food , and centuries of living at a metabolic rate of zero .  
Amidst the excitement and fury of a new tide of literary activity , 26-year-old Wang Anyi published The Falling Rain , a romantic short story about Wenwen walking through the rain in hopes of running across a boy she had once happened to meet . According to Sung Ju-shan , " Under the communist regime , with its stress on historical materialism , no one had ever before published a story that focused on the emotions of an adolescent girl .  
In 1978 , the legislative elections were canceled after the US announced it would switch diplomatic ties to the PRC . Many in the opposition camp ( represented by the newly published magazine Formosa ) favored working for change through street demonstrations , as opposed to the traditionally safer line of " reform through the system . " On December 10 , 1979 , the Kaohsiung riot occurred , and most of Formosa 's leaders were imprisoned . Democratization and the multi-party system were thus postponed .  
These are some of the main arguments that constitute Lin 's 1988 book China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy , which is now available for the first time in a Taiwan translation in Lin 's recently published The Nuclear Hegemon . Although China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy was published back in 1988 , it is still very enlightening for readers today to find out how Communist China 's nuclear weapons strategy is very much tied to Chinese strategic tradition . Anyone studying Communist China 's military can not ignore the influence of traditional strategic culture .  
" Historical truth " is of course a fascinating topic of its own . While Biographical Literature has had an unmatched impact on contemporary historians , on popular interest in history , and in capturing the flavor of the past , there is at least one point worth wondering about : It has rarely published any material about Taiwan over the last 50 years , such as the stories of the opposition movement or of well-connected families like the Lins or Koos .  
Author Chang Ta-chun holds a master 's degree in Chinese literature from Fu Jen Catholic University , where he is a lecturer in the Department of Chinese Literature . With his series of books published under the pen-name " Big-Head Chun , " he established an irreverent and satirical realist style ; his subsequent works The Lying Disciple and No One Writes to the Colonel , which combine topical news stories with imaginary scenarios , elicited a broad response and gave rise to much controversy .  
A number of Chinese authors have risen to fame in recent years with books published in English , including Nien Cheng , Amy Tan , Jung Chang , and Ha Jin . Now Adeline Yen Mah has joined the list with Falling Leaves : The True Story of an Unwanted Chinese Daughter .

An article published in 1932 by the Association for Promoting Taiwan 's Scenic Beauty describes the rigors of the road building task . In places the rock was very hard and highly fragmented , making it unsuitable for blasting with gunpowder . " Police squad leader Shibata tied a thick rope around his body and had himself lowered down the mountainside like a bottle on a string . First he cut a foothold wide enough to stand on with one foot , and then gradually enlarged it . "  
Most media and commentators have been positive toward the little three links . In an article published on December 25 , the United Daily News declared that , given the trend of economic globalization , the opening of the three links across the Taiwan Strait should bring unprecedented growth in cross-strait economic ties . In addition , promoting economic links is something that both sides find acceptable despite the frigid nature of the political relationship .  
Says Lin , " Because of the way the pieces are selected and the fact that most online readers are students , almost all the online works that get published in book format offer very realistic descriptions of school romance . I think these novels give young authors a chance to achieve a sense of closure in real-life romances gone wrong , and to use their experiences as a source of creative energy . " Lin feels that the popularity of such works is natural , since both the authors and readers are everyday people .  
The patient at the center of the story , Chou Chin-yao , eventually published an account of the incident entitled A Skin Graft with Love ( 1984 ) . " Each time I recall the extraordinary grace that Dr . and Mrs . Landsborough bestowed on one so sick , it brings me to tears , even though half a century has passed since then . Words can not describe the intensity of my gratitude .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
Also , in line with the general trend in education reform toward diversification of teaching materials , the integrated curriculum not only abolishes the current requirement for junior high schools to use the standard textbooks published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation , allowing them to use any approved textbook instead , but it also allows county and city governments , schools , and teachers to produce their own teaching materials , and particularly encourages schools to form " curriculum development committees " to devise course content .  
With regard to copyrighted imports such as newspapers , magazines , recordings and books , Chao explains that everything that has research value ( whether the copyright is held by an individual or an organization ) can be imported . Books and recordings of a cultural nature can likewise be published in Taiwan , so long as applications are filled and sensitive passages amended . But news-oriented newspapers and magazines from the mainland can not be published or sold here .  
Yang then fell upon hard times , and had to scrounge for a living playing in bars . Cheng Heng-lung , who together with his wife Kuo Li-chuan recently published a book about Taiwanese music , recalls that Yang San-lang was deeply distressed not only about his own fate , but also about the demise of Taiwanese-language music : " Yang had no one to turn to . He once broke down and cried before me . " It is a sad story , but Yang 's uncompromising love for his art inspires nothing but respect .  
In the broad sense , an electronic book , or e-book , means published content that is stored in the form of digital data on any kind of electronic storage media , such as a hard disk , floppy disk , optical disk or IC card , and transmitted through a data network to the user 's digital reading equipment , such as a PC , notebook , PDA or even a mobile phone .  
Chu Bong-foo says he first conceived Cosmic Drifter in 1998 . The ideas came from his previously published Nine Essays On Intelligence , in which he discusses thought , human nature and value in terms of energy conversion , the formation of matter , the nature of time and space , and the evolution of the universe . But the essays ' content was dry and dull , and nobody understood it . Therefore he wanted to turn his theories into a popular novel that ordinary people would understand .  
In fact , in a survey carried out two years ago by the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation and National Tsing Hua University , almost 40% of fish sampled from food markets contained excessive levels of " persistent organic pollutants , " which are likely to act as environmental hormones . However , following angry protests from fishermen after the report was published , no action was taken .  
To provide guidance for future legislation , I have begun collating a compendium of local and foreign academic writings , legislation and court rulings relevant to transgender rights . With regard to the protection of homosexuals ' rights , I recently published a monograph entitled On Equal Protection for Lesbians and Gay Men , which I hope interested readers will read for themselves .  
In recent years , annual reports published by American and European business associations based in Taipei have focused on the key question of opening the " three links , " shorthand for resuming normal trade , transportation , and mail routes with mainland China , and other cross-strait economic and trade policy . In fact , this issue has caused a number of foreign manufacturers to close their operations in Taiwan and to relocate to mainland China .  
Immediately after the war , Lung Ying-tsung edited the literature section of the Japanese-language China Daily and published a collection of informal essays entitled The Lonely Bookworm in Japanese . In this post-war period , he also wrote Qingtian Bairi Qi , a novel that describes the innermost feelings of Taiwanese youth welcoming the end of Japanese rule , and A Man from Swatow , which depicts the inner conflicts and sense of original sin felt by Taiwanese during the war . Lung withdrew from Taiwan 's literary circles in the 1950s .  
The situation is quite different in mainland China , where it is common for writers-both the famous and the unheralded-to have the same piece published some dozen times in publications large and small around the country . Relative to the cost of living , the writing fees there are quite ample , and writers who produce enough work should definitely be able to make a living off their writing . Under the circumstances , the publishing industry has tremendous potential and should move in the direction of the European and American models .  
Under the old system of economic planning , the distribution of published works in the mainland was all handled through a single state-owned channel ( known as the " first channel " ) - every region in the country had a Xinhua bookstore and supply unit . These Xinhua stores held sole control of delivery and distribution , a system entirely inappropriate for a free market .  
The established publication and distribution mechanism could n't keep up with the needs of the market or with the changing face of the industry . Now the mainland publishing industry is overburdened upstream and overwhelmed downstream : the production of published works is like a torrential river rushing to the ocean-but on reaching the estuary ( distribution channels ) , it can do no more than trickle in . Some merges into the " second channel , " while the rest overflows everywhere , unable to smoothly enter the ocean that is the literary market .  
True , these books may sell far less than the dazzling numbers pulled in by the best-sellers , but look at it another way . In terms of the total amount published , this steady , solid flow of books coming in from the mainland is already making serious incursions into the literary mass market .  
In March 2003 the Chinese edition of Scientific American magazine published an article entitled " Suicide : Why Do They Do It ? , " which pointed out that research by American scientists has shown that a type of neurotransmitter in the brain-serotonin-is related to emotional stability in humans , and that people suffering from depression who exhibit aggressive behavior , as well as people with compulsive and obsessive personalities , have lower levels of serotonin than normal people .  
When resources were short and a good number of books were forbidden , it was the second-hand book market that helped spread knowledge , and reading was considered more important than collecting . Today there are up to 400,000 new books published a year , so why do people still want to collect old books ? " It 's because the sheer volume of books being published is huge , it 's like a sea of books out there .  
In September of last year , Dr . Lin , who had for a long time focused her research on blood groups and ethnic groups , published the results of a study entitled " Correlation between SARS virus infection and the human leukocyte antigen . " Lin concluded that there is a direct connection between the presence of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B46 and the severity of a SARS infection . She found that ethnic southern Chinese who

The success of these policies will largely depend on political developments , but the availability of considerable IMF funding , subject to conditionality and close monitoring , may help to keep them on track , despite increasing popular protests against reforms in the run-up to the presidential elections in June . The projected growth rate for 1996 in the medium-term strategy is 2.3 per cent , but none of the variant forecasts made by the Ministry of the Economy , published in January , show positive GDP growth in 1996 .  
Furthermore , ESCWA published the biennial demographic and related socio-economic indicators on human development and socio-cultural specificity - the case of the Arab world ; the social dimensions of human development ; the situation of disabled women , their marginalization , and measures for social integration in the ESCWA region ; changing values in the Arab family ; and regional perspectives of human settlements in ESCWA countries .
