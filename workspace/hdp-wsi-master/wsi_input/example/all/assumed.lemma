The organization department of the provincial party committee , the provincial planning commission , the provincial financial department and 20 other units are taking lead in fighting against corruption and implementing various measures at their own and related departments and units .  
The shock wave evoked in China by an event tens of millions of li away from China illustrated that China , which as a permanent member nation of the UN Security Council and a gradually rising developing nation , has assumed a major responsibility in regional and global prosperity and security , and that world peace and stability are required in China 's reform and opening up .  
One political expert pointed out : During the years since Secretary of State Albright assumed her post , she has not at all had her own set of foreign policies or strategies to deal with the post-Cold War international situation .  She is merely an attendant who carries out US foreign policies .  In addition , on foreign affairs , she often focuses only on her native area of Europe , and adopts an attitude of much disdain toward Eastern and Southern Europe .  
After he assumed the post of executive vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , under the leadership and support of Premier Zhou , he intensified the building of the ministry 's leading body , upheld collective leadership , developed democracy , regularly held meetings on the ministry 's affairs and discussions on ideological guidelines , and instituted a system of daily meeting and timely report of the situation .  
Thanks to the extensive application of such high-tech research achievements as satellite positioning systems , expert diagnostic systems , and distance support maintenance systems , the space of vast battlefields has been condensed in a tiny screen , in which equipment commanders assumed personal command in a " central command tent " and had the situation of the entire battlefields well in hand without going out , and they were moving units on the Web .  
Since Bush assumed office , it seems that the hardliners have gotten the upper hand as far as foreign policy is concerned .  They appear to be more and more presumptuous , not only to China , but other countries have also taken note of it .  Even European countries with friendly ties with the US are very displeased with the US for " repudiating " what many countries had agreed upon , and refusing to sign the Kyoto Accord which sets a limit to the emission of substances that are harmful to the ozone layer .  
Although overseas media vied with one another in carrying " disclosures " on issues such as when Xu Junping defected , what post he assumed in the military , what were the motives for his defection , and what impact his defection would have on the Chinese Communist military , no conclusion had even been drawn .  Moreover , there were even many contradictory stories circulating around , making the already mysterious and unpredictable case more complicated and confusing .  
The US side , however , adopted an opposite attitude and way of doing things .  Instead of facing facts squarely and bearing responsibility , the US side has assumed a hegemonic posture , used lame arguments , confused right and wrong , and repeatedly made unreasonable accusations against the Chinese side , thus committing repeated errors .  
Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .  
Since Chen Shui-bian , a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , assumed the high post of president by winning less than 40 percent of the votes a year ago , Taiwan has suffered from political chaos and an economic downturn , with its unemployment rate jumping to a new 16-year high .  Both the ruling and the opposition parties have been trying their utmost to break through an encirclement at the year-end legislative elections .  
In all foreign policy debates inside the US Senate and even on the issues of relations with international organizations and payment of dues to the United Nations , this Republican hardliner always assumed an overweening and overbearing attitude , making people feel the individualized and insensible tendency in US politics .  
The Taiwan stock market has been all gloomy since the new Taiwan authorities assumed power .  The Weighted Index has fallen below the psychological level of 8,000 points , and the daily stock turnover has kept shrinking , once even registering only 50.2 billion New Taiwan dollars , a depressing sight .  
According to public opinion in Taiwan , Taiwan 's financial and economic policy has been swinging from side to side and various problems have arisen in its economy after the new authorities assumed power .  The unclear future of cross-strait relations , in particular , has been the fundamental cause of the stock market 's continuous fall .  
Since they assumed power , the new Taiwan authorities have not acted rationally and frequently implemented financial and economic policies which were contradictory to one another .  As Taiwan authorities are pursuing delaying tactics while waiting for changes , it is unlikely that the " three links " will be implemented within the foreseeable future .  
The US Government has always assumed a vigilant and preventive attitude towards those cult organizations operating in its native land , and never been soft in cracking down on those cults which have become quite influential in the United States .  
Since the new leader of Taiwan assumed office , he has never recognized the one-China principle , opposing reunification overtly and pursuing " independence " covertly , totally devoid of sincerity in improving cross-strait relations .  As a result , cross-strait relations continue to remain tense and a political crisis cropped up .  This is an even more serious background and deeper cause for the failure of his cabinet .  
Ever since President Museveni assumed office in 1986 , in particular , greater headway has been registered in the development of friendly relations of cooperation between our two countries ; and our cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , and other fields have yielded fruitful results .  
Since Clinton , who had come from " a remote and backward place , " had limited knowledge and experience , and his aides and staff also lacked experience , he repeatedly made mistakes after he assumed office .  In less than two years , he lost nearly all his political capital .  In the mid-term election , the Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives overnight , thus rewriting US history .  
First , before and after George W . Bush assumed office , he declared that the United States would promote a diplomatic policy based on a " unipolar world " and stressed the " leading position " of the United States . Meanwhile , he announced that the United States would adjust its global strategy and shift the strategic emphasis from Europe to the Middle East and Asia .  
As vice minister of public security and deputy head of the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling , Li Jizhou assumed the important responsibility of struggling against smuggling and other criminal activities .  However , he abused his authority , sought personal benefits , and seriously obstructed public security organs ' normal law enforcement activities .  The gravity of his discipline - and law-breaking act has seriously damaged the party and government 's prestige among the masses and resulted in bad political and social influence .  
This decision is completely consistent with Bush 's line of thinking that we would do " whatever it took to defend Taiwan . " No wonder that Luo-de , former U.S . ambassador to China and assistant secretary of state for Asian-Pacific affairs during the Clinton administration believe that undoubtedly the Bush administration , which has assumed office for less than 100 days , is changing the established policy pursued by the previous administrations on the Taiwan issue .

If we do not push hard for advanced development , how can we compete with other industrial countries ? For people who assumed nature 's resources to be infinite , the energy crunch of the 1970 ' s was a rude awakening , an indication of impending environmental crises stemming from careless spoiling and waste of natural resources .  
After current publisher Shaw Yu-ming assumed office , in 1987 Sinorama 's global vision was broadened and coverage of Chinese cultural traditions was strengthened . Series of reports on world sinology and sinologists , on famous universities , and other subjects appeared , and have already been collected and published in book form .  
" In the past . everybody assumed that all a high-tech company needed was technology to be successful . Later it was discovered that management skills are also required , " points out Hong . According to their studies of domestic and foreign experiences , the cause of failure of many companies is by no means that the product is poor , but that management is unsatisfactory .  
" We ca n't know if this was right or not , " admits Wu Tsung-neng . No one knows if the slowing of the epidemic was due to human effort or was a natural trend . However , from the fact that over the same time period other communicable diseases also were reduced , it can be assumed that the preventive measures taken against the enterovirus were effective .  
How the department came into being is a story in itself . Several years ago , a reporter was sent to interview a recently arrested suspect . The suspect wept bitter tears which the reporter assumed stemmed from his impending incarceration . But the suspect surprised the reporter , stating that he was not crying for himself , but was worried about how his elderly parents , his wife and his children would survive with him in jail .  
Under the old imperial system there was no police force per se , charged with maintaining social order . There were only various types of ruffians and lackeys , who frequently repressed the people and served as the cat 's -paws of corrupt and powerful officials . People assumed the newly formed police were going to be much of the same .  
FPG moved quickly to clarify the situation , and later stated that there had indeed been deficiencies in the selection of the company to which it had contracted disposal of the waste .

But despite these actions , FPG 's image as a pragmatic and responsible company has been severely tarnished .  
On May 20 , President Chen was officially sworn in at a ceremony carried out inside the Presidential Palace .

The president did not salute anyone , and I would like to assure Mr . Lin that his gesture did not have any Nazi implications . We beg Mr . Lin 's understanding regarding this issue .  
Since Chen Shui-bian assumed the presidency , however , the new administration has been concerned that a sudden termination of the nuclear plant might hamper economic development and strike a heavy blow to the business community . The administration accordingly instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) to set up the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant Re-Evaluation Committee to weigh the relative merits of building versus scrapping the plant .  
In the year 2000 , Liang Chieh-teh , a maker of documentary films , shot a nature film about terns on Matsu , and he accidentally discovered some Chinese crested terns there . The species had only been sighted five times before , and many assumed it was extinct or described it as a " legendary bird . "  
Wu Hsiao-ming , a doctoral candidate in international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai , assumed when he entered in 1997 that it would n't be long before direct travel would be possible between the two sides . Five years have passed and the prospect of direct travel is still remote . Many students likewise thought that the government would recognize mainland degrees by the time they finished their programs , and that everything would be smooth sailing thereafter , but this idea has proved far removed from reality .  
Regarding the international emphasis on " global " culture , Soyinka pointed out that the TIBE was featuring ancient Chinese culture , Czech culture , his own traditional Yoruba culture , as well as authors of Caribbean and American backgrounds , all exhibiting at the same time . This reveals that Taiwan is not a country that is culturally weak . In contrast to the strong centralizing trend of globalization , the TIBE assumed the appearance of an " anti-globalization " book exhibition , which felt marvelous .  
On June 8th , after the news broke , even before the sales of the normal boxed lunches at midday , there were already massive queues of eager customers waiting at the station cafeteria .

The causes are as well-known as they are difficult to resolve : double standards ; lack of democracy , of public information and transparency ; informal consultations and secret lobbying ; the obsolete veto power ; and the threat of the veto , which has become an even more dangerous and unacceptable instrument because the consequences of using it are not publicly assumed .

The statements made by the Secretary-General to date that no additional mandates can be absorbed have been based upon an assumption that budgeted cost levels and exchange rates will be fulfilled and that the level of real resources ( number of posts , vacancy rates , etc . ) assumed under the $ 2.6-billion appropriation will also evolve as anticipated and that efficiency gains now identified would be applied to achieving the mandated budget reduction of $ 154-million .

The Commission should realize that the necessity of strengthening those defences within the context of a project codifying for the first time the unwritten law of unilateral enforcement of international obligations , offers a most appropriate - and , in a sense , unique - opportunity to take a few valuable steps forward in the international law of dispute settlement , the development of which is characterized by an abundance of lip service which is inversely proportional to the number of really effective , " hard law " obligations assumed by States .

This has been achieved by making relevant amendments to the Access to space action area , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by it in this connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .

It was assumed that the end of colonialism , the cold war and apartheid would relieve the sufferings of many African peoples ; instead , the situation has deteriorated further , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and criminal gangs who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
In a document circulated last year , the Group of 21 stated that the prevention of an arms race in outer space has assumed greater urgency because of legitimate concerns that existing legal instruments are inadequate to deter imminent attempts for the further militarization of outer space .  
This has been achieved by making the relevant amendments to the Access to space action area by the appropriate means and mechanisms , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by Argentina in that connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .

The shock wave evoked in China by an event tens of millions of li away from China illustrated that China , which as a permanent member nation of the UN Security Council and a gradually rising developing nation , has assumed a major responsibility in regional and global prosperity and security , and that world peace and stability are required in China 's reform and opening up .  
One political expert pointed out : During the years since Secretary of State Albright assumed her post , she has not at all had her own set of foreign policies or strategies to deal with the post-Cold War international situation .  She is merely an attendant who carries out US foreign policies .  In addition , on foreign affairs , she often focuses only on her native area of Europe , and adopts an attitude of much disdain toward Eastern and Southern Europe .  
After he assumed the post of executive vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , under the leadership and support of Premier Zhou , he intensified the building of the ministry 's leading body , upheld collective leadership , developed democracy , regularly held meetings on the ministry 's affairs and discussions on ideological guidelines , and instituted a system of daily meeting and timely report of the situation .  
Thanks to the extensive application of such high-tech research achievements as satellite positioning systems , expert diagnostic systems , and distance support maintenance systems , the space of vast battlefields has been condensed in a tiny screen , in which equipment commanders assumed personal command in a " central command tent " and had the situation of the entire battlefields well in hand without going out , and they were moving units on the Web .  
Since Bush assumed office , it seems that the hardliners have gotten the upper hand as far as foreign policy is concerned .  They appear to be more and more presumptuous , not only to China , but other countries have also taken note of it .  Even European countries with friendly ties with the US are very displeased with the US for " repudiating " what many countries had agreed upon , and refusing to sign the Kyoto Accord which sets a limit to the emission of substances that are harmful to the ozone layer .  
Although overseas media vied with one another in carrying " disclosures " on issues such as when Xu Junping defected , what post he assumed in the military , what were the motives for his defection , and what impact his defection would have on the Chinese Communist military , no conclusion had even been drawn .  Moreover , there were even many contradictory stories circulating around , making the already mysterious and unpredictable case more complicated and confusing .  
The US side , however , adopted an opposite attitude and way of doing things .  Instead of facing facts squarely and bearing responsibility , the US side has assumed a hegemonic posture , used lame arguments , confused right and wrong , and repeatedly made unreasonable accusations against the Chinese side , thus committing repeated errors .  
Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .  
Since Chen Shui-bian , a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , assumed the high post of president by winning less than 40 percent of the votes a year ago , Taiwan has suffered from political chaos and an economic downturn , with its unemployment rate jumping to a new 16-year high .  Both the ruling and the opposition parties have been trying their utmost to break through an encirclement at the year-end legislative elections .  
In all foreign policy debates inside the US Senate and even on the issues of relations with international organizations and payment of dues to the United Nations , this Republican hardliner always assumed an overweening and overbearing attitude , making people feel the individualized and insensible tendency in US politics .  
The Taiwan stock market has been all gloomy since the new Taiwan authorities assumed power .  The Weighted Index has fallen below the psychological level of 8,000 points , and the daily stock turnover has kept shrinking , once even registering only 50.2 billion New Taiwan dollars , a depressing sight .  
According to public opinion in Taiwan , Taiwan 's financial and economic policy has been swinging from side to side and various problems have arisen in its economy after the new authorities assumed power .  The unclear future of cross-strait relations , in particular , has been the fundamental cause of the stock market 's continuous fall .  
Since they assumed power , the new Taiwan authorities have not acted rationally and frequently implemented financial and economic policies which were contradictory to one another .  As Taiwan authorities are pursuing delaying tactics while waiting for changes , it is unlikely that the " three links " will be implemented within the foreseeable future .  
The US Government has always assumed a vigilant and preventive attitude towards those cult organizations operating in its native land , and never been soft in cracking down on those cults which have become quite influential in the United States .  
Since the new leader of Taiwan assumed office , he has never recognized the one-China principle , opposing reunification overtly and pursuing " independence " covertly , totally devoid of sincerity in improving cross-strait relations .  As a result , cross-strait relations continue to remain tense and a political crisis cropped up .  This is an even more serious background and deeper cause for the failure of his cabinet .  
Ever since President Museveni assumed office in 1986 , in particular , greater headway has been registered in the development of friendly relations of cooperation between our two countries ; and our cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , and other fields have yielded fruitful results .  
Since Clinton , who had come from " a remote and backward place , " had limited knowledge and experience , and his aides and staff also lacked experience , he repeatedly made mistakes after he assumed office .  In less than two years , he lost nearly all his political capital .  In the mid-term election , the Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives overnight , thus rewriting US history .  
First , before and after George W . Bush assumed office , he declared that the United States would promote a diplomatic policy based on a " unipolar world " and stressed the " leading position " of the United States . Meanwhile , he announced that the United States would adjust its global strategy and shift the strategic emphasis from Europe to the Middle East and Asia .  
As vice minister of public security and deputy head of the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling , Li Jizhou assumed the important responsibility of struggling against smuggling and other criminal activities .  However , he abused his authority , sought personal benefits , and seriously obstructed public security organs ' normal law enforcement activities .  The gravity of his discipline - and law-breaking act has seriously damaged the party and government 's prestige among the masses and resulted in bad political and social influence .  
This decision is completely consistent with Bush 's line of thinking that we would do " whatever it took to defend Taiwan . " No wonder that Luo-de , former U.S . ambassador to China and assistant secretary of state for Asian-Pacific affairs during the Clinton administration believe that undoubtedly the Bush administration , which has assumed office for less than 100 days , is changing the established policy pursued by the previous administrations on the Taiwan issue .

If we do not push hard for advanced development , how can we compete with other industrial countries ? For people who assumed nature 's resources to be infinite , the energy crunch of the 1970 ' s was a rude awakening , an indication of impending environmental crises stemming from careless spoiling and waste of natural resources .  
After current publisher Shaw Yu-ming assumed office , in 1987 Sinorama 's global vision was broadened and coverage of Chinese cultural traditions was strengthened .

" In the past . everybody assumed that all a high-tech company needed was technology to be successful . Later it was discovered that management skills are also required , " points out Hong . According to their studies of domestic and foreign experiences , the cause of failure of many companies is by no means that the product is poor , but that management is unsatisfactory .  
" We ca n't know if this was right or not , " admits Wu Tsung-neng . No one knows if the slowing of the epidemic was due to human effort or was a natural trend . However , from the fact that over the same time period other communicable diseases also were reduced , it can be assumed that the preventive measures taken against the enterovirus were effective .  
How the department came into being is a story in itself . Several years ago , a reporter was sent to interview a recently arrested suspect . The suspect wept bitter tears which the reporter assumed stemmed from his impending incarceration . But the suspect surprised the reporter , stating that he was not crying for himself , but was worried about how his elderly parents , his wife and his children would survive with him in jail .  
Under the old imperial system there was no police force per se , charged with maintaining social order . There were only various types of ruffians and lackeys , who frequently repressed the people and served as the cat 's -paws of corrupt and powerful officials . People assumed the newly formed police were going to be much of the same .  
FPG moved quickly to clarify the situation , and later stated that there had indeed been deficiencies in the selection of the company to which it had contracted disposal of the waste .

But despite these actions , FPG 's image as a pragmatic and responsible company has been severely tarnished .  
On May 20 , President Chen was officially sworn in at a ceremony carried out inside the Presidential Palace . Afterwards he went outside to deliver his inaugural address to a waiting audience in the square in front of the Presidential Palace , at which point he repeated the pose that he had assumed while taking the oath . The president did not salute anyone , and I would like to assure Mr . Lin that his gesture did not have any Nazi implications . We beg Mr . Lin 's understanding regarding this issue .  
Since Chen Shui-bian assumed the presidency , however , the new administration has been concerned that a sudden termination of the nuclear plant might hamper economic development and strike a heavy blow to the business community .

In the year 2000 , Liang Chieh-teh , a maker of documentary films , shot a nature film about terns on Matsu , and he accidentally discovered some Chinese crested terns there . The species had only been sighted five times before , and many assumed it was extinct or described it as a " legendary bird . "  
Wu Hsiao-ming , a doctoral candidate in international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai , assumed when he entered in 1997 that it would n't be long before direct travel would be possible between the two sides . Five years have passed and the prospect of direct travel is still remote . Many students likewise thought that the government would recognize mainland degrees by the time they finished their programs , and that everything would be smooth sailing thereafter , but this idea has proved far removed from reality .  
Regarding the international emphasis on " global " culture , Soyinka pointed out that the TIBE was featuring ancient Chinese culture , Czech culture , his own traditional Yoruba culture , as well as authors of Caribbean and American backgrounds , all exhibiting at the same time . This reveals that Taiwan is not a country that is culturally weak . In contrast to the strong centralizing trend of globalization , the TIBE assumed the appearance of an " anti-globalization " book exhibition , which felt marvelous .  
On June 8th , after the news broke , even before the sales of the normal boxed lunches at midday , there were already massive queues of eager customers waiting at the station cafeteria .

Now , when we commemorate the historic injustice of 55 years ago , let our thoughts not be overwhelmed by the memory of the nefarious characters , Hitler , Mussolini and Stalin , who together assumed grave responsibilities for some of the most horrifying acts of territorial rape in the modern history of Europe , but rather remember the great politicians , Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer , the makers of the historic Franco-German reconciliation !

Even if it were assumed that globalization was an integral aspect of the normative structure of the established international economic system , the concerns expressed by the Group of 77 and others would seem to require additional antidotes , such as the establishment , for preventative purposes , of sound fiscal and monetary policies and early-warning systems , or normative counter-weights .

The causes are as well-known as they are difficult to resolve : double standards ; lack of democracy , of public information and transparency ; informal consultations and secret lobbying ; the obsolete veto power ; and the threat of the veto , which has become an even more dangerous and unacceptable instrument because the consequences of using it are not publicly assumed .

In areas in which public interest is lacking , there is no requirement of effective and beneficial use , and regulations and planning are disregarded and discouraged , experience shows that the role of markets has not been as relevant as is assumed by the theoretical justification of the model ; ( f ) Such areas are already experiencing problems due to the monopolization of water rights and related public services .  
The statements made by the Secretary-General to date that no additional mandates can be absorbed have been based upon an assumption that budgeted cost levels and exchange rates will be fulfilled and that the level of real resources ( number of posts , vacancy rates , etc . ) assumed under the $ 2.6-billion appropriation will also evolve as anticipated and that efficiency gains now identified would be applied to achieving the mandated budget reduction of $ 154-million .  
Apart from the general objection to the real or assumed punitive connotation of some of the consequences envisaged in draft article 16 - an objection obviously connected with the general conceptual and terminological issue we set aside [ 4 ] / - a number of specific reservations were expressed .  
The Commission should realize that the necessity of strengthening those defences within the context of a project codifying for the first time the unwritten law of unilateral enforcement of international obligations , offers a most appropriate - and , in a sense , unique - opportunity to take a few valuable steps forward in the international law of dispute settlement , the development of which is characterized by an abundance of lip service which is inversely proportional to the number of really effective , " hard law " obligations assumed by States .

Since an international organization , represented by its highest-ranking administrative officer , can in most cases conclude treaties with one or more States or with another international organization , it must be assumed that such an organization , represented by such an officer , can , in accordance with its internal rules , formulate unilateral legal acts which would no doubt be considered to belong to the category of acts that the Commission is now studying .  
This has been achieved by making relevant amendments to the Access to space action area , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by it in this connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .
