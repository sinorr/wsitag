Consequently , it is the individual concerned , the citizen , who is fully entitled , directly or indirectly , to choose those who exercise the governmental , representative or legislative function , and who renews or withdraws his trust _ or rather his delegation of authority _ at predetermined intervals and in accordance with rules that protect his freedom of choice and punish any attempt to vitiate or divert it .

Urges Governments and non _ governmental , national and international organizations to collect and disseminate gender _ disaggregated statistics and indicators to monitor the representation and participation of women at all levels of political , economic and social life , with special attention to the impact of the multiple barriers faced by many women who exist at the intersection of discrimination , based on race , gender and poverty ;  
Recalling that in the same resolution the Commission called upon the Sub _ Commission to focus on its primary role as an advisory body of the Commission , to facilitate efficient and effective participation of non _ governmental organizations , to devote sufficient time at its forty _ ninth session to the discussion of its working methods and to prepare specific recommendations on that issue for consideration by the Commission ,  
In that connection , an expert group headed by the Minister of Justice and composed of representatives of governmental agencies , non-governmental and indigenous organizations and scientists and academics had been set up to elaborate a national policy with regard to indigenous people and to contribute to the lawmaking process in that new area of national legislation .  
However , monitoring is basically carried out by governmental and non-governmental bodies which reflect the various interests of the community , given the close and multifaceted links between the institution in question , the President of the People 's Council and the district delegates to the municipal assemblies , who are popular leaders , elected by direct secret ballot ; all of these act as mechanisms for participatory democracy in the community where the institution is located .  
The aims of the training course were to familiarize participants with the international and regional systems of protection of human rights and procedures to be followed for the preparation of relevant reports , and to provide participants with the requested training tools in order to guarantee an element of continuity through the replication of training at the national level for relevant governmental departments .  
In resolution 1997 / 57 , section IX , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on the prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and other vulnerable groups , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
One of the principal reasons cited for the current situation of human rights in Afghanistan was the lack of central power , governmental institutions , unified legal system and a clear social , political and economic system .  
The Special Representative seeks to influence relevant actors within the international community , governmental or non-governmental , to support developments in Cambodia that would promote civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
Since governmental and non-governmental organizations and individuals have important roles to play in ensuring that human rights are respected , national human rights education strategies and plans of action should be developed and implemented by a creative mixture of all of such entities .  These Guidelines are not intended as a blueprint for a nationally coordinated effort in human rights education .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1997 / 57 in which it requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect , all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
The unique advantage of UNDP in this area derives from its extensive field presence in the region , its role as a trusted and objective provider of information and advice and coordinator of United Nations system programmes , its widespread contacts with governmental and non-governmental entities , and its growing body of technical expertise in country offices .  
Joint ventures , often utilizing extrabudgetary funds , have been organized with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , the business community , appropriate private enterprises and relevant governmental institutions .

It emphasizes promoting healthy habits in schools ; rekindling the commitment of local governmental units , non-governmental organizations , and the private and public sectors to make lodging facilities , food establishments and marketplaces more sanitary and healthful ; and promoting healthy workplaces , non-polluting vehicles and clean and sanitary streets .  
To this end , by agreement between the two Governments , governmental and academic experts from both countries have begun to formulate a binational study on migration , the central purpose of which is to provide an objective , comprehensive and long _ term analysis of migration to be used in designing and enforcing more effective policies that address the real causes and effects of migration .  
As a follow-up to its expert group meeting on the role of governmental and non-governmental sectors in developing and implementing practical strategies on ageing in countries in change and transition , the United Nations programme on ageing prepared a technical publication entitled " Older persons in European countries in transition from the centrally planned economies : designing a policy response " .  
In the United States , the Department of Justice is engaged in an ongoing initiative to establish effective and productive working relationships between the federal Government and state governments and local governmental subdivisions .  
The objective will be to develop an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the implementation , coordination and promotion of the right to development in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , aimed at facilitating action to be taken by relevant bodies of the United Nations system , including human rights treaty bodies , and international development and financial institutions and non _ governmental organizations .

Given the gravity of the concerns highlighted , the mandate remains a most sensitive and difficult one since it relates to a State Member of the United Nations where governmental authority is absent and a State administration non _ existent , with the adverse impact this implies on the observance and protection of basic human rights and freedoms .  
As a result , the underlying concept of " Vienna " was that concerted governmental action at both international and national levels was required in order to build up endogenous capacities within developing countries .  
All responsible actors are requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrating a gender perspective into sustainable development , between governmental ministries and departments , and at the international level , between United Nations agencies , funds and bodies and other international entities .  
This includes , inter alia , the right , individually and in association with others , to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs , criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work which may hinder or impede the promotion , protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In light of such demands , committee membership will be feasible only for governmental officials paid by their national authorities ( a situation unlikely to guarantee either independence or expertise ) , academics subsidized by their Governments ( since in todays climate of budget cuts and a user-pays approach most universities are unlikely to be prepared to subsidize international service for half the year ) , or retirees .

Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development . 
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries , and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
With regard to diplomatic protection by international organizations , her delegation believed that since the number of international , regional and governmental organizations had grown immensely in the past decade , the functional diplomatic protection of those organizations formed an important part of contemporary diplomatic protection .  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,

The agreed conclusions on women in power and decision-making placed an emphasis on conflict resolution , peace and security matters , and the promotion of gender balance at all levels of national diplomatic service , including the ambassadorial level . 4 For example , Governments and the United Nations system were called upon to promote women 's active and equal participation as governmental and non-governmental representatives , special rapporteurs and envoys in all of their initiatives and activities , including as mediators for peacekeeping and peace-building . 
In the case of UNDP , non-core resources are constituted by funds contributed by governmental or private sources and intended for specific purposes , i.e . , identified projects or programmes , or assistance within geographic or thematic areas .  
This is achieved by analysing and understanding the key elements of international transactions , including the relevant elimination of constraints ; developing methods to facilitate transactions , including the relevant use of information technologies ; promoting both the use of these methods and associated best practices through channels such as governmental , industry and service associations ; coordinating and integrating the work under the subprogramme with other international organizations ; and securing coherence by cooperating with other interested parties in recognition that the work has broad application in the areas beyond global commerce .  
Noting rule 7 of the rules of procedure of the Conference of the Parties , which provides that any body or agency , whether national or international , governmental or non-governmental , that is qualified in matters covered by the Convention , and that has informed the permanent secretariat of its wish to be represented at a session of the Conference of the Parties as an observer , may be so admitted unless at least one third of the Parties present object ,  
Many governmental representatives also stated that it is not necessary to arrive at a universal definition of indigenous peoples in the context of the draft United Nations declaration , although some Governments recognized the concerns of countries with complex ethnic and historical circumstances .  
Indeed , while we applaud the recognition granted to local government in Chapter 28 of Agenda 21 , the two pages in that Chapter hardly reflect the immense financial , infrastructure , administrative and governmental contribution of local Governments to the green and brown agendas or to the agendas of the North and South .

The Chairman-Rapporteur noted that no governmental delegation had expressed formal opposition to the establishment of a permanent forum for indigenous peoples within the United Nations system , although a number of Governments had stated that they had not yet taken a final position with regard to whether a new forum should be established , or whether it would be sufficient to broaden the mandate of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations .

The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
This provision has been the subject of controversy between federal States and non-federal States , particularly as regards the problem resulting from the potential dual capacity of constituent units to exercise governmental authority on behalf of the State or on their own behalf , pursuant to the distribution of public power between the State and its constituent units according to the relevant constitution .

The Workshop was composed of qualified academic and governmental lawyers in their personal capacities , taking into account geographical representation ; and was based on the premise that , in moving towards sustainable development , international environmental law is inspiring new and innovative concepts , principles and ideas , and developing facilitative and enabling mechanisms and procedures in areas such as implementation and compliance and dispute avoidance and settlement .  
To strengthen effective collaboration and coordination among various programmes in governance and public management currently carried out by various United Nations agencies , including Bretton-Woods institutions such as the World Bank and IMF , it is recommended that the consultative group include representation from all relevant United Nations agencies , regional commissions and the World Bank . The group will also be open to other interregional and regional governmental organizations and appropriate international or regional professional and research institutions .  
The Commission should be provided with a mandate under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations enabling it to carry out a thorough investigation and receive the full cooperation of members of the international community implicated in alleged violations of the embargo , so as to send a strong signal to all arms dealers of the world and their governmental supporters that they can not supply arms to a genocidal organization benefiting from the abuse of human rights with impunity ;  
Government and local business representatives should be encouraged to participate in national and international industry and technical groups as a means of facilitating technology transfer , gaining market intelligence , raising and keeping apprised of industry-wide issues and concerns and as a means of formulating long-term relationships with other industrial , government and financial leaders .

The recommendations cover , inter alia , ensuring that the burden of proof is reversed regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds or other property liable to confiscation ; concluding agreements with other Governments on the sharing of confiscated illicit proceeds in order to promote the willingness of Governments to investigate and share information on money-laundering activities ; and contributing at least part of the value of confiscated proceeds and property to governmental and intergovernmental bodies that specialize in the fight against illicit traffic in and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
Private consumption has also been weighed down by a number of other factors : higher taxes and social security charges and reductions in governmental transfers have dampened the growth of disposable income ; and in some countries the weakness of the housing market and the persistence of negative equity in privately owned houses , as well as the continued reduction of earlier levels of indebtedness , have also discouraged spending .  
To that end , the co-sponsors invited individuals from specific governmental agencies and private industries to attend and , in order to receive the full benefit of the programme , the co-sponsors also requested that each participating organization or company wishing to attend the Conference should send both the chief operating officer or the equivalent and the senior technical officer .

Strengthened by a five-year mandate , the new Government has moved quickly to address the fundamental problems impeding development , such as weak governmental institutions , economic inefficiency and corruption , and has laid out economic policies which seek to stimulate growth and reduce inflation by encouraging domestic investment and job-creating programmes .  
The period has seen the rise of numerous institutions - national ( governmental , academic and private ) , subregional and regional - which engage in analytical and operational activities similar to those of ECLAC .  
Systematic and continued involvement of all concerned parties in all stages of the work , including governmental institutions , forest owners , the private sector , local and indigenous communities , indigenous and non-indigenous forest dwellers and relevant national non-governmental organizations , will be necessary in order to help ensure overall soundness of approach , timely implementation and sustainability of efforts over time .  
A major regional project covering 26 countries in eastern Europe and CIS was launched in 1995 and executed by ECE to assist national statistical offices in developing the human resources necessary for building self-sustainable capabilities for the collection , processing and analysis of reliable social and demographic statistics , and enabling the appropriate governmental institutions and agencies of these countries to monitor the social aspects of development .  
As to the nature and causes of small arms ' destabilizing accumulation and transfer , in his January 1994 Supplement to an Agenda for Peace , the Secretary-General identified four basic reasons : earlier supply during the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets and criminal activity combined with the collapse of governmental law and order .

At the governmental level , the exercise of power in what were certainly crucial moments for the future of the country was gathered in the hands of the President of the Republic , the Prime Minister , the Minister of Defence and the National Security Council , while the other ministers in the Government were barely kept informed of Burundi 's request for foreign security assistance made at the 25 June Arusha Summit and supported by the Yaound Summit a dozen or so days later . 
In essence , the assumption of all governmental powers by SLORC in 1988 constituted , as mentioned earlier , a break from constitutionality and legal continuity and further constituted a departure from the norms governing the enjoyment of political rights proclaimed in article 21 of the Universal Declaration . There could , arguably , have been some legitimacy in the assumption of power by SLORC , without the consent of the people , in circumstances which could be said to have amounted to a state of public emergency threatening the life of the nation .  
As emphasized earlier , in the delicate conditions prevalent in new and restored democracies , there is a need to coordinate what may otherwise be disjointed actions of non-governmental organizations not only with governmental plans , but also with assistance provided by bilateral donors and multilateral organizations .

Since many questions and misunderstandings surround the definitions and content of the terminologies of sects , new religious movements and even formal religion and since in international practice confusion reigns and States may have diametrically opposed attitudes to the same group , raising it to formal religious status or pejoratively classifying it as a sect , the Special Rapporteur feels that an international high-level governmental conference should be held to study and decide upon a common approach to sects and religions that respects human rights . 
The objectives of the Independent Bureau have remained the same as those pursued by the Independent Commission , i.e . , to study specific humanitarian issues that have been inadequately dealt with to date or that call for solutions in line with new realities ; to identify opportunities for more effective action by the international community and to make practical , action-oriented proposals to that end ; to enhance public awareness of the conditions that create and perpetuate human suffering ; and to strengthen efforts at governmental and non-governmental level to bring about appropriate changes and adjustments . 
In addition , price measures might suffer from a number of practical problems : the changing nature of output and the increased heterogeneity of products made it very difficult to compile consistent price measures over time ; service industry outputs were notoriously difficult to define and to price ; and measuring the price of governmental outputs presented major conceptual problems .  
The Committee is also concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to ensure effective coordination between different governmental departments competent in the areas covered by the Convention , as well as between central and local authorities .  
Despite the negative effect of the financial situation of the United Nations , as pointed out by the Assistant Secretary-General for Public Information , great progress had been made in improving the work of the Department and innovating when implementing its programmes , thanks no doubt to its links with educational institutions , think tanks and national and local governmental institutions , as well as international media organizations .  
According to the governmental delegates , the State and its legislation , while recognizing the dominant , but not overwhelming , role of the Orthodox Church , which represents the religion of the majority of the population for historical , national and traditional reasons , are said to provide a climate of religious freedom , notwithstanding isolated cases of intolerance or discrimination , in particular in the administration .

Such a culture is built upon a societal consensus not about policy , but about the process and framework of democratic political life : that the will of the people is the basis of governmental authority ; that all individuals have a right to take part in government ; that there shall be periodic and genuine elections ; that power changes hands through popular suffrage rather than intimidation or force ; that political opponents and minorities have a right to express their views ; and that there can be loyal and legal opposition to the Government in power . 
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .

Many governmental representatives also stated that it is not necessary to arrive at a universal definition of indigenous peoples in the context of the draft United Nations declaration , although some Governments recognized the concerns of countries with complex ethnic and historical circumstances .  
Indeed , while we applaud the recognition granted to local government in Chapter 28 of Agenda 21 , the two pages in that Chapter hardly reflect the immense financial , infrastructure , administrative and governmental contribution of local Governments to the green and brown agendas or to the agendas of the North and South .

For other atrocities , documentary evidence that directly implicates individuals , whether at the senior governmental level or the regional or local level , is currently not available and may never be found given the uneven nature of record-keeping in Democratic Kampuchea and the apparent loss of many documents since 1979 .

The Chairman-Rapporteur noted that no governmental delegation had expressed formal opposition to the establishment of a permanent forum for indigenous peoples within the United Nations system , although a number of Governments had stated that they had not yet taken a final position with regard to whether a new forum should be established , or whether it would be sufficient to broaden the mandate of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations .

The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
This provision has been the subject of controversy between federal States and non-federal States , particularly as regards the problem resulting from the potential dual capacity of constituent units to exercise governmental authority on behalf of the State or on their own behalf , pursuant to the distribution of public power between the State and its constituent units according to the relevant constitution .

UNICEF has actively publicized its view that it is unacceptable that a clear ban on childrens recruitment has not yet been imposed on the direct and indirect participation in hostilities of children below 18 years of age , regardless of whether they have been forced to join armed forces , or whether they appear to have done so voluntarily ; this applies equally to governmental and non-governmental forces .  
Lack of governmental coordination at the national level : Responsibility for family issues and programmes concerning individual family members ( for example , children , women , youth and so forth ) is usually shared between numerous ministries and agencies within a given country , giving rise to many coordination challenges and making it difficult to develop and implement comprehensive strategies for families , children and so on ;  
Singapore drew attention to a recent penal provision enhancing penalties for offences committed against foreign domestic workers by employers or members of the household of employers . 16 The Philippines indicated that its comprehensive legislation on migrant workers , including protective provisions for such workers and penalties for abuses , such as illegal recruitment , and providing for information dissemination and shared information systems for governmental agencies , was being accessed .

The favourable response with which the United Nations system and other governmental and non-governmental organizations greeted the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa led us to believe that the international community would , in a meaningful way , join in the activities undertaken by Africa to resolve conflicts , consolidate democracy and ensure economic and social development .  
Recalling further that these initiatives called for , inter alia , discussions on these themes on the basis of in-depth reports at the global , regional and national levels by intergovernmental , governmental , diplomatic , academic and civil society3 experts at conferences , seminars and other meetings as well as through the Internet , to be reported on to the General Assembly for consideration at its fifty-fourth session ,

The advantage of applying existing international human rights law lies in its comprehensive delineation of the prohibited grounds of discrimination and the corresponding governmental obligations which , in the case of racial and gender discrimination , envisage structural alongside individual measures for the elimination of discrimination .  
For this reason , countries with a well established tradition of private participation in infrastructure projects have developed a series of control mechanisms and remedies to protect government contractors against arbitrary or improper acts by public authorities , such as access to impartial dispute settlement bodies and full compensation schemes for governmental wrongdoing .  
In order to address that lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , of which five major situations had been identified , it would be useful to identify and draw upon international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , applicable at all times , to all circumstances and to all actors , both governmental and non-governmental , as well as any individual .  
One priority of the humanitarian pillar of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo , which is headed by my Special Envoy , is to help these people through the winter we are working hard , together with major governmental partners such as the United States of America , the European Union and Japan and many non-governmental organizations , to meet this deadline.But more intractable problems remain unresolved .

The Working Group was concerned at the continuing abusive treatment of women , including custodial deaths , torture , rape , abduction , disappearances , arbitrary arrests , forced abortions and sterilizations , harassment and arson by security forces , including military and police forces , or by other governmental authorities , particularly where separatist movements were reported .  
The enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is hindered by the absence of the rule of law , the existence in Nigeria of military governments , the suspension of the Constitution in favour of rule by military decree and the concomitant resort to intimidation , and the negative effects of widespread corruption on the functioning of governmental institutions .  
It was keenly aware of the constraints that were impeding implementation of the Programme of Action , including the increase in poverty worldwide , the persistence of gender inequality and governmental restrictions on participation by civil society , but it hoped that the international forum that was scheduled to be held in The Hague in 1999 would be able to address those constraints .  
Also , within the context of the modernization of the legal system , several government committees were working with governmental organizations which played a leading role in promoting and strengthening respect for human rights at the national , regional and international levels .  
In implementation of high royal instructions placing rural areas at the heart of governmental strategy , in the framework of the policy enabling all citizens to participate in cultural life and to contribute to the improvement of rural living conditions , and with a view to improving the geographical distribution of cultural services and facilities , the Ministry of Culture has initiated , in cooperation with local communities , an extensive programme to build and equip libraries in rural centres .

One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant governmental agency conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .  
The circulation of press organs is not authorized , permission is not given for the functioning of new non _ governmental human rights organizations , which have been waiting for years to be recognized , the movements of the population within the country are controlled by military checkpoints , there is oppressive supervision of all private activity and in practice political dissent is viewed almost as a crime , particularly by the peripheral authorities of the mainland region .  
In her introduction , the representative of Kyrgyzstan informed the Committee that the initial report had been prepared by a special commission established for this occasion that included governmental and legal officials .  
The opposition takes the form of a veiled and persistent conspiracy : the efforts of the white minority to hold on to economic power and privileges , the sabotaging of governmental initiatives within the administrative system , negative propaganda in certain media regarding government activities , and attempts to depict the equal opportunity and affirmative action policies as racism and inverted racial discrimination .  
Such a conference would provide a forum for Ugandan religious leaders , parliamentarians , notables , local political and administrative leaders , non _ governmental organizations and associations to discuss the situation in northern Uganda , with a view to formulating a political platform conducive to the pacification of northern Uganda through participatory political processes and socio-economic rehabilitation .  
The wide-ranging dialogue , with questions from Governments and non _ governmental organizations , covered such issues as female genital mutilation ; violence against women ; womens economic , social and cultural rights ; and ways and means of improving United Nations actions protecting the human rights of women .

The Chairperson-Rapporteur proposed a revised work programme which would not include a time-frame for informal governmental meetings , but would allow for the plenary to be suspended if requested by the participants , whether governmental or indigenous representatives , and when the chairperson considered it useful and a contribution to the process .  
However , the emerging view of the participating governmental delegations was that the alternative texts could be considered as an acceptable basis for further work and could be presented to the working group in order to advance the discussion in plenary .  
It was also stated by governmental delegations that , in discussing these alternative texts , Governments had taken into account the guiding principles for standard-setting working groups in the field of human rights contained in General Assembly resolution 41-120 and had also borne in mind what had been said at the current and previous sessions on other principles that should be taken into consideration .  
That provision had been the subject of controversy between federal States and non-federal States , particularly with regard to the problem resulting from the potential dual capacity of constituent units to exercise governmental authority on behalf of the State or on their own behalf , pursuant to the distribution of public power between the State and its constituent units according to the relevant constitution .

The role of the Working Group on Communications , under the revised procedure , is to examine communications and any governmental replies with a view to bringing to the attention of the Working Group on Situations any particular situations which appear to reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 11 The Working Group of the Subcommission will now meet after the annual session of the Subcommission rather than before , as was previously the case . 
Concern has been expressed that , where the summary of a 1503 communication is edited to eliminate material that may not deal expressly with the rights of women , this may distort the overall gist of the communication and may make it difficult to evaluate a governmental response that addresses all issues raised in the original communication .

Express our conviction that political platforms based on racism , xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and discrimination must be condemned as incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance , and that racial discrimination condoned by governmental policies violates human rights and may endanger friendly relations among peoples , cooperation among nations , and international peace and security ;  
There are several short - and medium-term measures developing countries should consider for profiting from enhanced production and export opportunities : ( i ) awareness-raising ; ( ii ) research and market studies ; ( iii ) facilitating certification and reducing its costs ; ( iv ) developing national standards ; ( v ) developing local markets ; and ( vi ) providing appropriate governmental and technical support .  
The present report is based on the replies from 12 governmental agencies which were received by mid April 2001.1 A shorter version of the questionnaire was transmitted to relevant international organizations , specialized agencies and cooperative organizations ; 21 responses were received . 2 Respondents provided information on the action taken in the following areas :

While that view attracted some support , a concern was that mentioning governmental financial or economic support in a model legislative provision would be tantamount to recommending that support be given by the Government , a result that was considered inappropriate in respect of those Governments whose policy was not to grant any support for privately financed infrastructure projects .
