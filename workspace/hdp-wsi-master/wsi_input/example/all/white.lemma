On the firing practice field , a group of soldiers in camouflage uniform quietly lied prostrate in the cold wind .

My esteemed fellow colleagues : Not long ago , the Chinese Government issued the white paper on " the one-China principle and the Taiwan issue . "  In this paper , we reiterated our principle and stance on the Taiwan issue , that is , upholding the one-China principle and the basic principles of " peaceful reunification and one China , two systems , " opposing any attempts of splitting China and permanently maintaining the current state of separation , and not allowing the Taiwan issue to drag on indefinitely .  
Because , as internal disputes are getting white hot and technical and political defects of the NMD program are being exposed daily , the US . Government 's confidence in this program is dropping lower and lower .  
However , the Vatican has turned black into white by " canonizing " these sinners , who had a notorious record , in an attempt to reverse the historical fact of the imperialist aggression against China . This act has severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and is intolerable to every religious believer who loves his country .  
They painted the Yihetuan boxers as " devils " that killed people without blinking an eye , and created rumors that the Yihetuan killed people and set fires , and " tore foreign envoys and missionaries into pieces " .  Further , they cried that " the Chinese hated the Europeans " , " the yellow people were hostile to the white people " , and " the Yihetuan boxers wanted to destroy Western Civilization " .  
Now , standing tall under blue skies and white clouds , the manned space flight launch tower seems to declare without making a sound that China 's aerospace equipment and technology has joined the ranks of the world 's most advanced .  
The self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square is not merely Li Hongzhi 's stinging slap in the face to his disciples , but it should be said that the political intelligence of the anti-China forces in the West has sunk to so low a point that they are unable to tell black from white , and they willfully confuse right with wrong . 
The western anti-China forces have discovered the points in common they have with Li Hongzhi and taken a favorable view of the use value of " Falungong , " and have thus not hesitated to reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong in gesticulating and making groundless accusations at the Chinese Government for banning the " Falungong " cult according to law .  
Compared with the Yuanhua case , the Chaoshan tax fraud case involves not only huge sums but also evil methods ; the corrupt officials " united as one to cheat the old CPC " and " worked with concerted efforts to plunder the state treasury , " and in addition the methods they used were that of " white wolves with empty gloves " and they directly plundered more than RMB 100-billion from the state treasury by fraudulent means .  
On 9 May 2000 , USAF Chief of Staff and Commander jointly published a white paper , entitled Aerospace Force : Defending America in the 21st Century , which emphasized again that the Air Force should be developed from a force trained primarily for air battles into an " aeronautic and astronautic integrated " air force , or aerospace force , capable of fighting both air and space battles .  
The Chinese Government and people express strong indignation and discontent at the move of the Japanese Government , heedless of China 's many stern representations and ignoring the just cries of the peoples of Asia , in being bent on allowing the emergence of this textbook which confuses right and wrong and reverses black and white .  
All these arguments , which confuse right and wrong and confound black and white , are attempts to cover up Japan 's criminal history of aggression with a " beautiful veil " and deceive the future generations so as to attain the aim of completely changing the traditional evaluation of the war of aggression .  
In fact , this incident in which a white policeman shot and killed a black is just the tip of the iceberg in America 's long-running racial problem , and the racial violence that it triggered was by no means accidental ; nor was it an isolated incident , but the evil result of racial discrimination in America .  
Before we came to the Military Representative Office to gather news , we already learned that the military representatives here enjoyed very high prestige .  By the time we went round the military plant , we were surprised at what we found .

Since the decision has violated the US commitment written in black and white in the three Sino-US joint communiques , especially that in the " 17 August " communique , and has wantonly interfered in China 's internal affairs and brazenly challenged China 's sovereignty , the Chinese Government has lodged a strong protest and made solemn representations to the US Government on the issue .  
Fu Tieshan , president of the China Patriotic Catholic Association and vice president of the Chinese Catholic Bishops College , pointed out : The annual report issued by the US International Religious Freedom Commission cooked up something out of nothing , confused right and wrong , mixed up black and white , violated the norms of international relations , and grossly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  This is unacceptable to people of China 's religious circles .  
The SEF-vs-ARATS mechanism was originally a temporary expedient designed to play the role of a " white glove " under the circumstances in those years when there was no official contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , and was therefore a measure based on a specific objective historical background and serious political considerations .  
At a certain place in eastern China , a hunter chasing an animal in a dense forest suddenly came upon a sight that stopped him in his path : A unit of soldiers , wearing green berets , herb-spot camouflage uniforms , and white armbands were charging toward him , along with scores of tanks in camouflage ; the tanks were not displaying the " 1st August army emblem " but a triangular military emblem .  The hunter ran as fast as he could .  
Observers maintained that the white paper breaks up in a timely manner the Taiwan authorities ' " Taiwan independence " - inclined and " delaying and waiting-for-change " tactics , displays a warning to the major political figures participating in Taiwan 's general election , and points out the orientations that these political figures should follow .  
The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "  
Even in the United States , which is the most developed country in the world , there are many problems in its human rights situation .  But the United States has never looked squarely at its own human rights problems , still less has it published an annual report on its own human rights situation .  Instead , it compiled a white paper on other country 's human rights in accordance with its own standards and its incorrect and partial data and used it as the means for interfering in other country 's internal affairs .

Now the established size of the entire military is kept under the level of 2.5 million personnel , and consequently the Chinese military has embarked on the road toward streamlined armed forces with Chinese characteristics .  
Zhu Bangzao continued : The US State Department spokesman , ignoring the facts and juggling black and white , made irresponsible remarks and a groundless allegation on the Chinese Government 's lawful handling of the evil cult Falungong . This is entirely unacceptable to the Chinese side .

He said : This is totally unacceptable to the Chinese side , which has expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm objection .  
Russia has three major weapons : strategic nuclear missiles , anti-satellite weaponry , and directional anti-missile high-energy laser and particle beam weaponry .

Although the oysters on the white porcelain dish were small , they gave off a rich aroma that the fat chunky oysters in Taiwan just do n't have .

It was only then that I realized why the early immigrants to Taiwan were so deeply attached to ou-a-jian .  
With a fine ink , a literatus could produce numerous hues , draw forth the endless mysteries that lie between black and white , and create unique and exquisite images . Indeed , with such ink to hand , a literatus could hardly bear to set his brush aside .  
Before starting to paint , face painters first take a red cloth to hold down the actor 's hair while exposing the face .

Chen explains that in the earlier times most of these were made from bamboo pulp and sheets of strawboard , but those were n't water repellent and were easily damaged when it rained .

The explanatory memorandum annexed to document A / 50 / 145 presumptuously claims that the examination by the United Nations of Taiwan 's " exceptional situation in the international context " " completely conforms with the principles and spirit of preventive diplomacy " .  This is an apparent attempt to confound black and white and mislead the public .  
The flag of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( hereinafter referred to as the flag of the Commonwealth ) shall be the symbol of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( hereinafter referred to as the Commonwealth ) and shall consist of a right-angled dark blue field in the centre of which is a white figure made up of vertical bars , diverging symmetrically in the upper part of the figure to right and left to form concentric ring-shaped design elements .

Indeed , in struggling for a just cause , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is determined to defend itself , not only at the military level ( through the exercise of individual or collective self-defence ) but also at the judicial level ( through an application to the International Court of Justice ) in order to secure the condemnation of the aggressors and just compensation for the damage suffered , including the damage described in this white paper .  
In the first volume of the white paper , the Ministry of Human Rights concentrated on the massive violations of human rights and of the basic rules of international humanitarian law by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The opposition takes the form of a veiled and persistent conspiracy : the efforts of the white minority to hold on to economic power and privileges , the sabotaging of governmental initiatives within the administrative system , negative propaganda in certain media regarding government activities , and attempts to depict the equal opportunity and affirmative action policies as racism and inverted racial discrimination .  
According to a recent white paper , the latter had moved all its dependent Territories from their former colonial status into a modern partnership status that extended to administrative , economic , social and environmental matters .

My esteemed fellow colleagues : Not long ago , the Chinese Government issued the white paper on " the one-China principle and the Taiwan issue . "  In this paper , we reiterated our principle and stance on the Taiwan issue , that is , upholding the one-China principle and the basic principles of " peaceful reunification and one China , two systems , " opposing any attempts of splitting China and permanently maintaining the current state of separation , and not allowing the Taiwan issue to drag on indefinitely .  
Because , as internal disputes are getting white hot and technical and political defects of the NMD program are being exposed daily , the US . Government 's confidence in this program is dropping lower and lower .  
However , the Vatican has turned black into white by " canonizing " these sinners , who had a notorious record , in an attempt to reverse the historical fact of the imperialist aggression against China .

They painted the Yihetuan boxers as " devils " that killed people without blinking an eye , and created rumors that the Yihetuan killed people and set fires , and " tore foreign envoys and missionaries into pieces " .

Now , standing tall under blue skies and white clouds , the manned space flight launch tower seems to declare without making a sound that China 's aerospace equipment and technology has joined the ranks of the world 's most advanced .  
The self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square is not merely Li Hongzhi 's stinging slap in the face to his disciples , but it should be said that the political intelligence of the anti-China forces in the West has sunk to so low a point that they are unable to tell black from white , and they willfully confuse right with wrong . 
The western anti-China forces have discovered the points in common they have with Li Hongzhi and taken a favorable view of the use value of " Falungong , " and have thus not hesitated to reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong in gesticulating and making groundless accusations at the Chinese Government for banning the " Falungong " cult according to law .  
Compared with the Yuanhua case , the Chaoshan tax fraud case involves not only huge sums but also evil methods ; the corrupt officials " united as one to cheat the old CPC " and " worked with concerted efforts to plunder the state treasury , " and in addition the methods they used were that of " white wolves with empty gloves " and they directly plundered more than RMB 100-billion from the state treasury by fraudulent means .

The Chinese Government and people express strong indignation and discontent at the move of the Japanese Government , heedless of China 's many stern representations and ignoring the just cries of the peoples of Asia , in being bent on allowing the emergence of this textbook which confuses right and wrong and reverses black and white .

In fact , this incident in which a white policeman shot and killed a black is just the tip of the iceberg in America 's long-running racial problem , and the racial violence that it triggered was by no means accidental ; nor was it an isolated incident , but the evil result of racial discrimination in America .  
Before we came to the Military Representative Office to gather news , we already learned that the military representatives here enjoyed very high prestige .

Since the decision has violated the US commitment written in black and white in the three Sino-US joint communiques , especially that in the " 17 August " communique , and has wantonly interfered in China 's internal affairs and brazenly challenged China 's sovereignty , the Chinese Government has lodged a strong protest and made solemn representations to the US Government on the issue .  
Fu Tieshan , president of the China Patriotic Catholic Association and vice president of the Chinese Catholic Bishops College , pointed out : The annual report issued by the US International Religious Freedom Commission cooked up something out of nothing , confused right and wrong , mixed up black and white , violated the norms of international relations , and grossly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  This is unacceptable to people of China 's religious circles .  
The SEF-vs-ARATS mechanism was originally a temporary expedient designed to play the role of a " white glove " under the circumstances in those years when there was no official contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , and was therefore a measure based on a specific objective historical background and serious political considerations .

The hunter ran as fast as he could .  
Observers maintained that the white paper breaks up in a timely manner the Taiwan authorities ' " Taiwan independence " - inclined and " delaying and waiting-for-change " tactics , displays a warning to the major political figures participating in Taiwan 's general election , and points out the orientations that these political figures should follow .  
The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "  
Even in the United States , which is the most developed country in the world , there are many problems in its human rights situation .

Russia has three major weapons : strategic nuclear missiles , anti-satellite weaponry , and directional anti-missile high-energy laser and particle beam weaponry .
