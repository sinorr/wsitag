A large number of technical and new type managerial and administrative talent was trained , the transformation of the enterprise 's operational mechanism and the reorganization of assets were accelerated and a lot of modern famous brands such as Shanghai Bell , Shanghai Volkswagen , Konka , TCL , etc . were formed . 
Foreign capital and intermediate and long-term credit banks should be supported and encouraged to take part in the development and construction of the western regions , and efforts should be made to achieve breakthroughs in investment forms and operational modes in accordance with the methods for the management of foreign financial institutions .  
Take our Jian area as an example : After reform and opening up , it practiced the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and the cooperative shares system and adopted multiple operational forms in the state-owned enterprises , so that the economic strength repeatedly increased , the people 's living standards were continuously enhanced , and the peasants ' per capita income grew from 130 yuan in 1978 to more than 2,000 yuan last year .  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
Zeng Peiyan said : Of course , there are also problems accompanying our advance and development , the major ones being the insufficient effective demand , slowing growth in fixed assets investment , irrational economic structure , production and operational difficulties of some state-owned enterprises [ SOE 's ] , growing employment pressure , and slow growth of peasants ' income .  
In the field of service trade in particular , as Hong Kong itself is a WTO member , knowing its rules of game very well , and boasting a flexible management system and rich operational experience in accordance with the international customary practices , it can take the lead in making access to China mainland , helping the mainland enterprises merge with the world , and at the same time winning valuable development opportunities for itself .  
To be sure , Tibet 's falling behind by far the country 's average development standard is due to both historical and natural factors .  However , we must not lay the blame on objective factors alone .  After all we need to calmly and realistically analyze subjective and operational factors as well .  
As far as military strategy was concerned , the United States had adopted a new set of operational methods for high-technology limited warfare following the end of the cold war , but NATO 's operational methods and command systems had not departed completely from the operational approach designed for the prospect of fighting big battles with the Soviet Union . Therefore , there was a lack of coordination between them in the operations .  
A government-guiding strategy was gradually set up , and a situation in which leaders attached importance to tourism , all relevant departments make joint efforts , social participation was encouraged to jointly develop tourism on a large scale was created .  The market operational mechanisms in keeping with international practice was also set up on the whole .  In 1996 , the tourist industry successfully achieved , ahead of time , the foreign exchange earning goal set forth by Comrade Deng Xiaoping for the end of this century .  
In accordance with the DPRK Constitution , which was amended in 1998 , DPRK has allowed official organs , enterprises , or organizations to cooperate with the foreign legal persons or individuals in operation and has encouraged all types of enterprise operational activities in its designated " special economic zones . "  The DPRK has also begun working hard to improve its investment environment .  
The electronic business is to bring electronic technology to the overall trade activities , and has the characteristics of low operational costs , a wide spread of electronic service subscribers , no limit on time and space , and direct interaction and exchange between electronic service providers and subscribers .  In addition , the capacity to make warehouses , goods shelves , and stores virtual has reduced the intermediate links , which in turn greatly reduces trade cost and trade cycle .  
Before each landing operation , concentrated and unified command organs with specific command responsibilities and various other relevant organizations are established according to the makeup of the participating force and the actual operational requirements , harmonious command relationships are specified , and scientific and rational operational plans are drawn up .  
They should not only use scientific theories to arm themselves and to guide their practical work , but should also show a thirst for knowledge ; make hard efforts to master the knowledge of modern finance , science and technology , and the law ; familiarize themselves with the operational rules of the international market , and learn from the management of multinational companies ;  
In the course of this reform , the position and role of commercial banks in the economic operation have been substantially elevated .  Meanwhile , the adequacy and accumulation of capital funds in the commercial banks seem to lag behind the rapid growth of their operational scale , so that the situation that the capital adequacy ratio is on the low side and fails to reach the appropriate level has emerged .  
It should be said that the participation of non-state-owned shares in the capital will help the large-sized commercial banks ascertain their operational objectives , resist administrative intervention , change the traditional non-marketized operations formed in the state-owned commercial banks for many years by means of the shareholders ' interest mechanism and supervisory and restraining mechanism such as auditing supervision and so on , and promote the healthy development of the economy and the banking industry .  
The reflection of knowledge economy and innovative ability in military domain can be seen in the emergence of intellectual weaponry , informationized warfare , and military units that are equipped with digitized equipment .  This is a fact , which proves that the first and earliest application of advanced and new science and technology is in the battlefield .  Therefore , the innovation of military knowledge , the innovation of military science and technology , and the innovation of strategy and operational method are necessary for defeating the enemy and winning the victory .  
Piracy has seriously disturbed the economic and cultural operational orders in the country and worsened the environment for national cultural industries ' survival , thus causing a massive drain on state revenues and causing cultural business units ' failure to gain an advantageous position in competition amid world economic integration by making it difficult for them to achieve effective accumulation and rapidly expand their industrial scale .  
To ensure uniformity with the task of preparing for a military struggle , informationization should be matched with the technical level of troop equipment .  The aim of informationization development of China 's army must keep the world military development in large reference , based on the possible developments in future warfare , particularly the possible operational opponents that might be faced .  We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
In recent years , although China 's army computer network has developed fairly quickly , the mutual connectivity between agencies at the regimental level and above has been realized in the majority of units .  However , this situation frequently occurs : As soon as operational training meets with emergency circumstances , computers are abandoned and a return to manual operations ensues , and the more fierce the struggle , the more willing one is to return to " re-operating old-style affairs . "  
The present training revolution in the American military is primarily embodied in the use of information , simulation , network , and artificial intelligence technology , and the methods and process in changing training have enabled the troops to receive " full physical and mental " training in simulating the " combined man and machine environment " of real combat .  Before engaging in real fire exercises the troops are already prepared with a fair amount of practice in operational skills , even using simulation to train for weapons systems that have yet to become operational .  
We should strengthen the collection and accumulation of all kinds of operational data , not only collecting complete information on our side , but even more clarifying of detailed reference data and indicators on our operational opponent , particularly on the foremost opponent 's technical equipment , operational theory , battlefield geographical circumstance , and important operational targets .  
At present , the most pressing is to cultivate a unified military and technological database to develop talent , and timely extension of investigation of military strong points and survey of large military areas , constructing precise military-use digital mapping .  Thus we will lay a fine foundation for network troop training and operational simulation .  
The " 148 " hotline is a socialized , mass , complex legal service project , which needs to be run after an operational pattern characterized by persistent , unified leadership of the party committee , close support by related departments , and comprehensive coordination among judicial and administrative organs .  
In a war exercise recently held at a certain place in the northwest , a certain division under the Lanzhou Military Region successfully intercepted a simulated cruise missile using an air defense missile of a certain model , accomplishing for the first time a new operational method for striking extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with one-man portable air defense missiles and receiving favorable comments from senior officers of the general headquarters who were there watching .  
A simulated trainer jointly developed by them for high-speed target tracking by portable missiles has brought about digitized analog simulation for the training on the operational method for striking extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets and has doubled the speed of target tracking .  
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
This sub-section has taken the lead in conducting this new method of joint tri-service transportation under modern operational conditions in the whole army to meet the needs of future military struggles since the formal initiation of the combined service system .  
The regiment successively built a comprehensive military tactics training ground which integrated the strategy of railway loading and unloading tactics , shooting with light weapons , and positional defense training , and a military officer training center with all functions , built a language teaching room and a simulation training room , introduced a simulation training system with electronic countermeasures and provided a good service guarantee and technical support for reforming the training methods and studying operational methods .  
The training exercise command center on board the vessel , which had been jointly set up by the units of the state organs or military units concerned , had found out or tackled problems through coordination ; had revised in a timely fashion both the measures and steps for the wartime emergency mobilization and requisition of civilian vessels ; and had built a faster and highly efficient operational mechanism during the training exercise .  
Faced with the fierce market competition , a multitude of enterprises have focused their efforts on converting their operational mechanisms , intensifying the reforms within themselves , diverting surplus employees by laying them off in order to improve efficiency , and strengthening and improving enterprise management .  They have made strenuous efforts in ending their predicament and raising their competitiveness as quickly as possible .  
Currently we should put our efforts into in-depth understanding of the specific meaning of preparations for the military struggle in the new period , clarifying the possible specific operational tasks and operational modes we might carry out , and completing training and training the troops to elite status .  
Military units have been supplied with some new equipment now .  To make the equipment combat effective , leaders at all levels should first make theoretical breakthroughs , master the operational theories and detailed rules for examining the new equipment , and lead the military units to complete basic training and explore new experience .  
With series of new characteristics , such as modern joint campaigns , accelerated tempo of operational progress , large consumption of equipment materials , hyperspace , real time , diversified targets , highly efficient means , and intensive management of resources , mobile support tasks will be more arduous .  
Under the order of their commander , officers and men on an array of combat vehicles which are equipped with devices that have been developed and innovated with high technology are successfully blocking attacks launched by precision-guidance weapons against vital targets ; the operational methods they are employing includes " causing confusion by forming a block with scattered laser absorption , causing confusion with simulated intelligence-based infrared rays , causing confusion by misguiding using the positioning system , and creating spoofing confusion with radar evasion " . .  
The division has also gradually established and refined through constant explorations an operational application system , a cadre and backbone training system , a training and support system , and a comprehensive assessment system , and has thus brought about profound changes for essential elements of fighting capacity in each and every aspect and enhanced its all-round operational capability by a large margin .  
Examples are building early-warning and preventive mechanisms , forming an APEC financial early-warning group ( composed of finance ministers of major economies and financial experts ) , enhancing macroeconomic coordination , establishing emergency financial assistance mechanisms , enacting APEC rules for financial activities , supervising the flow of large amounts of capital in the region , and setting up financial personnel training organizations to raise the financial operational and management ability of developing economies .  
Since our army 's network and website building is still at such a primary stage as network personnel handling military issues and the majority of our army 's qualified personnel are still of technical support in nature and have yet to extensively develop or apply the existing hardware or software system in terms of functions and in light of operational decision , command , and tactic , faced with the fast advent of information warfare and network warfare , our army should make further efforts to carry out follow-up research ; explore countermeasures ; 
Our military personnel also had to rely on domestically made gas masks .  As far as this aspect is concerned , our armed forces now have a series of advanced protective equipment , which is suitable to the physiological feature of all ethnic groups in China and which meets various operational needs .  In addition , China also has a group of world-renowned experts on poison protection .  
With the deepening of the reform of naval training in recent years , the trend of training troops by high-tech means is advancing with the force of gusty winds and surging waves .  New types of warships and combat planes that were included into the battle array during the Ninth Five-Year Plan have basically become combat effective .  The Navy has put great emphasis on operational and combined-arms tactical training for combined operations .  
The rapid development of modern aircraft-borne weapons systems ; the surface-to-air missile units which are capable of reaching high-precision hit rates , fast operational response , wide shooting ranges and multiple targets ; and the anti-aircraft artillery units have formed into an air defense system of crossing firepower at high , medium-high , and low altitudes .  
In the exercise of " continuous attacks by submarines against an enemy frigate formation " organized by the base in early November , commanders of the " Red " and the " Blue " sides carried out confrontations without giving advance notice on their operational intentions .  Strong winds and heavy storms happened to be ragging at the sea area where the drill was conducted .  Large sea waves and low visibility increased the difficulty of spotting the targets .  
In light of the operational characteristics of missile vessels and the technical and tactical levels of their attacks , it intensified training in such difficult areas as twin planes ' minimum altitude attacks and interception .  
According to reports , Russia , in addition to taking active and passive defensive measures in developing its satellite systems , is also developing its antisatellite weapons on the basis of the operational antisatellite satellites , which the former Soviet Union developed , and on the basis of testing the land-based antisatellite laser weapons .  
A certain unit in the navy has actively explored adapting to the new path of future warfare , characterized by rapid and cross-territory emergency support logistics , realizing the two great leaps of changing from the one type of solitary missile support unit of the past to multiple series and multiple types of missile support , and from transferring missiles from reserves for support into direct provision of real-fire missile support to operational troops .  This has enabled the troops ' missile support capability to manifest historic changes .  
This is really a sorrowful reality .  At a time when " the overall situation is set and it is not far away , " should we pay attention to the introduction of the WTO regulations and operational mechanism , rather than remaining at the level of shouting slogans , stirring up news , and analyzing advantages and disadvantages ?  Should we adopt a more rational , pragmatic , and scientific attitude ?  
To put it in concrete terms , first , we will institute a standard modern enterprise system , encouraging large and medium-sized SOEs to practice the joint-stock system , amplify the legal person management structure , and change their operational mechanism through such forms as standardized listing in the stock markets , joint ventures between Chinese and foreign investors , mutual share-holding , and so on . 
Lin Chong-pin stated : Beijing 's Taiwan policy has been obviously integrated with its strategy , and the basic framework of this policy has not changed and remains to be the " one country , two systems " and " peaceful reunification . "  In the tactical aspect , however , Beijing has constantly readjusted the forms of this policy .  Since July 1999 , Beijing has applied four operational tactics toward Taiwan .  
As radical nationalism in itself is just an operational platform for speech , it must be combined with other ism values in order to assume the state of actual political operation .  In terms of contemporary China , the ideology or ism the most capable of functioning well on the platform of nationalism is exactly leftist radicalism ; such a leftist current of thought , revitalized through being combined with radical nationalism , will acquire momentum in terms of " being able to command the local lords in the name of the emperor . "  
After our WTO entry , our agricultural product markets and agricultural key element markets will be tied to the international market , and this will help us learn from others , introduce competitive mechanisms and regulations of the international market , and accelerate a sound and complete market system and operational mechanism for agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  
After our entry into WTO , domestic agricultural markets will certainly come into contact with the international market .  Faced with the unified , large international market which has over one-hundred years of history and which enjoys increasingly sound and healthy systems and operational mechanisms , such short-comings as the split between trade , industry and agriculture , disconnects between production and marketing , and enclosed , excessive and disorderly regional competition in our domestic agricultural market which has been divided by departments and administrative regions will be fully exposed .  
The operational concept of " full dimensional protection " which was proposed by the US military in 1996 calls for the establishment of both offensive and defensive measures to deal with information warfare , guided missiles , and nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons of mass destruction .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
On 16 March , we saw " gunsmoke " rising inside an indoor campaign operation room of a certain group army in the Nanjing Military Region , for a joint operational training exercise was under way there , involving units of various services and arms : Commanding officers at all levels in several units of various services and arms were skillfully directing operations in accordance with a campaign resolve by coordinating and cooperating with one another in tacit agreement and by launching a fatal strike at an " enemy " with a " heavy fist " as well .  
The Chinese Government and people have the right to know why the US sidefrequently dispatched military surveillance planes to China 's coastal waters tocarry out activities , why the US plane violated operational rules and suddenlyveered , bumped into , and destroyed the Chinese plane , and why the US planeintruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed at a Chinese airportwithout permission . 
A combination of operational forces has been accelerated further through the wide use of microelectronic and software technologies with computers at the core , remote and sense technologies dominated by battlefield monitoring and target detection , and military high-tech , such as military engineering , antichemical , and military command and management technologies .  Meanwhile , a new situation of joint operations , with coordination between frontline and rear units , among three armed forces , and between the military and civilians , has taken shape .  
The mechanism for talks between the two associations on the two sides of the strait is presently still the most feasible and workable consultative channel .  The government has not considered changing or adjusting the consultative mechanism for the two associations from the two sides of the strait .  The operational mechanism for the two associations is sufficient for responding to and handling cross-strait issues , and it is still not yet time for changing it .  
An important mission in warfare research is to study new rules for commanding war in light of changes in the form of warfare , with special emphasis on the way operational guidelines and strategic military operations are prepared and executed .  
Thus apart from laying a solid foundation of knowledge , especially by taking a " general course " on directing joint operations in a military academy or school , our commanding officers should also devote more energy to learning and applying knowledge on different services and arms through peacetime campaign training exercises ; should work hard to learn about the basic formations of different services and arms as well as the functional features and operational principles of different types of weapons and equipment ;  
wherever blockades are organized , the area is bound to lose the spirit of fair competition , and the operational environment deteriorates , with the result that genuine investors flinch at the sight , the quality of economic growth declines , and economic vitality is thus weakened , and this is actually having eyes only for the present and forgetting about the long term .  
The " operational manual for new-type aircraft and fighters " compiled by reading several hundreds of new aircraft materials , studying and analyzing over a-hundred pieces of cabin equipment and aerial test flight verifications , and with the efforts of Li Keqiang and pilots of the whole regiment was published , thus providing effective technical support for our military training for refitting new-type fighters .  Following that , six volumes of " collections of theses on study of new-type aircraft tactical and combat methods " were compiled and published .  
As revealed , the new model of antisatellite satellites that Russia 's new space force will be equipped with is two to three metric tons in weight and four to six meters in length and has an operational altitude of 5,000 km .  It can attack reconnaissance , navigational , and meteorological satellites deployed by an enemy in low Earth orbits as well as space planes .  
In ancient times , because the level of social productive forces was low and the technological equipment of armed forces was backward , with a lack of variety in arms and services and relatively simple operational methodology , the main format of operations was uniformly infantry engagement on the ground .  
The difference is that combined operations are dominated by synergy of different arms based on a dominant arm , supplemented by the support among different services , so as to form an overall operational power within the systems of the arms .  They normally serve the purpose of achieving tactical objectives and the operational strength , means of command , and formats of operations are relatively unvaried and the degree of synergy is relatively low .  
Supported by a total of nine regional operational control centers ( ROCC ) , including a temporary center commissioned in Iceland in 1988 , the JSS system has deployed a sensor-surveillance network , comprising a total of 85 radar , including 47 on the US territory , which are capable of monitoring areas 320 kilometers wide on the US territory and in the surrounding areas . 
62 and 71 airborne brigades according to the " armed forces refining program " .  It is slightly different from foreign exclusive special operations units , such as the US Navy SEALs , French GIGN , and British SAS and SBS .  It is a multipurpose special operations unit responsible for various operational tasks , such as defending mountain regions , anti-airborne operations , and coming to the relief of cities , in addition to such offensive operations as special airborne operations .  
At this crucial moment in a new stage of development , state-owned enterprises must calmly cope with the new situation and guard against any blind optimism and intention of relaxation .  They should continue to concentrate on deepening the reform , consolidate what they have achieved in restructuring themselves and lifting themselves out of difficulties , and persist in raising their operational efficiency so as to lay a sound foundation and create a favorable situation for meeting the medium - and long-term targets of their reform and development .  
The ministers reaffirmed the statement of the Brunei Ministerial Conference and Informal Leadership Meeting on launching a new round of multilateral trade talks in 2001 , held that the WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in November in Qatar represents a critical opportunity for the launch of a new round of WTO talks and that it is necessary to accelerate WTO work , speedily formulate a balanced , operational , broad-based agenda for the talks , and expressed particular concern for the interests of developing members .  
Then , aside from assigning the personnel with doctorate or master 's degrees to units with modern equipment and positions that require scientific and technical expertise , the region also gave them important military assignments to accomplish , or assigned them to oversee projects of tackling difficult operational and training problems .  
A joint command will have to concentrate both qualified and capable command personnel and technologically advanced command facilities .  On the basis of guaranteeing efficient operation , a joint command will have to set up fewer vertical command links , and recruit fewer but highly capable personnel , aside from constantly studying new command measures , and raising command efficiency , thus ensuring timely , highly efficient , and acute command , and unleashing overall operational efficiency to the greatest extent , in a key zone , and at a crucial juncture .  
It is necessary to fully explore scientific and technological strengths on the basis of accommodating characteristics of information society and to build the military 's internal network of information on political education and make such a network operational as soon as possible , so as to reduce the number of levels and simplify procedures to ensure that education can keep up on a timely basis , respond rapidly , work effectively , and produce real results .  
We must push forward " four innovations " with persistent efforts , namely , innovating in theories , contents , methods , and systems , and work hard to bring about a breakthrough in our military theories , operational guidance , and basic tactics .  We must energetically press ahead in an all-round way our activities of training troops through science and technology , and popularize and upgrade such activities as well .  In training our troops through science and technology , we must also work hard to translate achievements into fighting capacity .  
The southern Fujian fishing ground is among the Chinese fishing grounds abundant in aquatic products .  It is adjacent to the Zhoushan fishing grounds , the eastern Guangdong fishing grounds , and Taiwan 's shallow water fishing grounds and has an actual operational fishing ground as large as 26,000 sq . km . in area and shoals and surface as large as more than 200 sq . km .  
Officers and soldiers of the detachment had undergone several weeks of training in port and along the coast .  They also had undergone simulated attack training scores of times .  Their training programs included radar searches , transmitting target parameters , preparing for missile attacks , and making command decisions .  Their reaction time has continuously shortened .  The operational skills of relevant personnel have been greatly improved .  All these factors have laid a foundation for the detachment in successfully using missiles to attack mobile target ships that can change speed and direction .  
We should do so by starting with leaders in various financial institutions .  We should uphold healthy trends , develop new practices , enhance institutional initiative and creativity , and carry out to the letter , the decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council . We should make fresh , and greater contributions , through pushing forward a financial reform , rectifying financial order , stepping up financial supervision and control , and heightening operational efficiency , and should guard against and alleviate financial risks , and support national economic development as well .  
So , it is of essential significance for the " Group on Adjustment of the Policy on the Mini Three Links " to establish an office in Kinmen . The DPP Central Executive Committee appointed Chen Chao-nan to take part in the Kinmen election by considering him a suitable candidate owing to his frequent visits to Kinmen to collect public opinion .  The party has its operational mechanism and will make proper arrangements .  
To make a breakthrough in this logistical support at sea , this base has organized missile technology experts and officers and men of battleships and logistical support ships to jointly study various operational measures for overcoming adverse weather conditions and formulated scientific plans on missile replenishment .  
The Gulf War and the Kosovo War have both borne out that since weapons have become more antipersonnel , only with superior operational capacity on the part of combat personnel , who are equipped with appropriate equipment and guided by a correct theory , will a combat unit secure more chances for winning a battle .  
The Genoa meeting discussed many topics , but it mainly discussed global issues including reduction and exemption of poor countries ' debts , environmental protection , resolution and elimination of regional crises , and prevention and treatment of AIDS . However , the only accomplishment of this meeting would be its decision to establish a " global health fund . "  The fund intends to be fully operational within 2001 and aims to deal with AIDS , malaria , and TB , which are the three major contagious diseases threatening mankind .  
The provision for a department to be in charge of a Sino-foreign joint venture was a result of the planned economic system of those days .  After the economic structural reform , government administration have been separated from enterprise management , and administrative organs separated from enterprises .  Under the socialist market economic conditions , in particular , enterprises enjoyed full authority to make their own managerial decisions , and the government mainly carried out macro-direction and is not supposed to intervene in enterprises ' specific production and operational activities .  
Besides , the Corps has also mapped out a series of rules and regulations , renovated and transformed the bulk of its installations , correspondingly erected a number of facilities of a preliminary scale , and introduced a whole set of automatic management systems , thus bringing about a leap forward for operational positions management , from human operations to automated operations .  
After the trials of training in high temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius and frigid cold of 30 degrees Celsius below zero ; after successively moving across Bohai , Donghai , Nanhai , and other sea areas ; after undergoing rigid training and roughing it out , the Navy Marines of our army have now found an operational program that is suitable for moving , eating , living , and fighting in all kinds of weathers and environments under the condition of modern warfare .  They have also mastered the skill of fighting in complicated regions .  
In view of southwest China 's complex terrains , changeable climates , and harsh environments , they have trained a number of " all-weather " contingency units that have strong weaponry support - - through setting up courses that train units for highland operations with long-range weaponry support in the theater under inclement weather conditions .  Meanwhile , they have come up with new operational and training methods that meet the needs of actual operations and the special features of new weaponry .  
Mou went on : In the new century , we 're bound to see a faster flow of goods , services , information , capital , and personnel .  With global economic cooperation constantly renewed and upgraded in terms of content and mode , we 're also bound to witness endless drastic changes in global trade in terms of operational speed , operational mode , and enterprises ' production mode and operative mode as well .  
It is impossible to successfully organize such a colossal and complicated support by relying on the army 's logistic department alone .  The only way to meet the operational needs is to rely on the economic strength of the state as a whole to blend operational logistics support into the " vast logistics " for society to effect an army-civilian integral support .  
The integrated logistics support system is independent organizationally and unitary task-wise .  The joint operational logistic support system alone is responsible for all general-purpose supplies and services and special-purpose supplies and services .  This will effectively remedy the drawback of the existing system in which general-purpose support and special-purpose support are " two separate lines " vertically and " detached " horizontally .  
The existing joint rear service system based on military regions still adopts the past method of combining supply and demand as one and integrating fund and support-in-kind .  This can hardly meet the demand of the " three-dimensional matrix " style operational mechanism of integrated support .  The mechanism for logistical operation must be changed .  
With its great efforts over the past 50 years , the Chinese Navy has initially built a modern marine operational force composed of the crack troops of five branches - - surface warships , submarines , naval air force , coastal guard , and the marines .  The Chinese Navy is capable of carrying out various kinds of operational tasks on coastal waters .  
Reform will continue to take the institution of a modern enterprise system and operational mechanism suited to the requirements for the market economy as a center , so as to quicken the pace of enterprises ' strategic reorganization , speed up the reform of a standardized company system , and develop a coordinated specialized and socialized system .  
The foreign environmental protection enterprises ' natural link with the market economy enables them to gain advanced experiences in operational mechanism , market concepts , innovation awareness , personnel and distribution system , and others which are suited to the market economy .  These are useful experiences that the domestic environmental protection enterprises can use for reference in their development , reform , and transformation of operational mechanism at a faster pace so as to suit the major development trend of the environmental protection markets all over the world .  
However , the absolute quantity of civilian products produced by armament industry enterprises declined rapidly , mainly because of insufficient investment , debt payment failures , competition of foreign goods , unsuccessful privatization , and technological and operational difficulties in changing products .

Thanks to the construction and development over the past half a century , a remarkable improvement has been registered in the overall surveying and mapping level of our army ; and the use of new and high technologies , represented by satellite positioning , remote surveying , digital mapping , and a military geographic information system , has provided a strong surveying and mapping support for the operational commanding of our army .  
China 's banking industry should accelerate its pace of transforming operational mechanisms , bring about banking system upgrading , open up new business spheres , elevate its managerial level in a comprehensive way , open the financial sector wider to the outside world , maintain the state 's financial security , and facilitate the strategic adjustment of the national economic structure and the change of economic growth pattern .  
Deng Xiaoping advanced the theory on the implementation of the open policy in socialist states and took the open policy as a basic national policy on China 's socialist construction .  To gain advantages comparable with that of capitalism , Deng noted , socialism should boldly absorb and use all civilized achievements created by human society , including developed capitalist states ' advanced operational and managerial approaches that reflect the law of modern socialized production .

Since sufficient grant resources have not been forthcoming on a voluntary , predictable and assured basis to support operational activities at the level required , consideration needs to be given to a funding system which would place operational activities on a more viable basis .  
Smaller specialized agencies have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with highly focused subsectoral issues and that operational activities should remain flexible to meet requirements in these specific technical areas .  
The United Nations system continues to play an important role in many traditional areas of operational activities in several countries : nearly all developing countries cited technical and technological assistance , social development , poverty alleviation , health and education , and the improvement of human resources as continuing priorities for the United Nations system .  
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;  
In response to the acknowledged need to strengthen the operational capacity of the United Nations programme , UNDP , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies were called upon to support technical cooperation activities devoted to strengthening the rule of law , in cooperation with the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including proper coordination and fund-raising efforts .  
The Council stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , through advisory services and training programmes , field studies and action-oriented research at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels .  
At the same time , operational activities are to be expanded significantly and a solid base for technical cooperation and assistance established , to strengthen the programme 's role as a service provider , as well as an honest broker in putting prospective donors and clients in touch , promoting international exchanges , coordinating regional and interregional action , etc .  
The crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including its network of institutes , could usefully be included in the new combined promotional and operational TCDC activities , and priority undertakings such as the replication of successful innovative projects , development of subject-specific TCDC products , promotion of joint strategies to deal with the problems faced by groups of countries , and mobilization of support , including triangular cooperative arrangements .  
Issues addressed here are closely related to those being considered by the General Assembly at its current session with respect to international cooperation in the eradication of poverty in developing countries , the International Year for Poverty Eradication , the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development , the coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences and the comprehensive policy review of operational activities .  
While there is a need for basic operational reliability , many established and routine forms of communication can be utilized effectively for early warning if there is an official recognition of their utility and organizational planning to do so .  
In areas where UNITAR enjoys a strong comparative advantage , a reinforced General Fund would have a multiplying effect , since the programme officers or managers could dedicate all their time to increasing the scope and range of their programmes , improving methodologies and materials , and raising funds for concrete operational activities .  
States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;  
As a follow-up to the conclusions of the 1995 annual meeting , civic leaders will receive more training in the planning and design of social policies and a framework will be established for exchanges of information between mayors and entrepreneurs , incorporating operational information about investment projects in the participating cities , with a view to facilitating the creation of a market for strategic urban projects in Ibero-America .  
The United Nations system 's operational activities for rehabilitation during the past year have focused on assisting local communities in rural infrastructure , food production , health improvement , animal health services , rehabilitation of disabled people and human settlements .  The main underlying purpose of these activities is poverty alleviation and human development .  
In that connection , activities that could improve the operational use of space technology were the establishment of local receiving stations , increased accessibility to environmental data and the stimulation of data sharing between international , regional and national organizations and agencies .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Taking into account the vast area of the country , its ravaged infrastructure and the total number of military and civilian personnel to be mobilized throughout the Mission area , the services of these aircraft are considered essential in accomplishing the operational requirements of the Mission .  
Member and observer States of IOM were using a newly devised process of strategic planning to affirm and strengthen the organization 's role in dealing with the operational challenges of migration , increasing emphasis on better understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development , and working to ensure the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  
Recommendation 1 : Wherever United Nations system organizations desire to enhance cooperative relationships with the multilateral financial institutions , their executive heads and the governing bodies responsible for operational activities for development should make a meaningful commitment to increase the competitiveness of their programmes .  
The United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , which was the core of the system of operational activities , had provided assistance in such crucial areas as national capacity-building in management , governance and democratization , private sector development and economic reforms , human resources , the social sector and the development of environmentally sound energy sources .  
Jamaica , therefore , supported recommendation 6 of the Secretary-General 's report ( A / 50 / 202 ) which called for the re-energizing of negotiations on a new , improved funding system in accordance with resolution 48 / 162 , which had called for a substantial increase in funding required for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis . 
In the interests of increased savings and the successful implementation of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and given the fact that the outcome thus far had fallen short of expectations , his delegation attached great importance to the ongoing efforts of resident coordinators to ensure closer involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions in operational activities , in particular at the field level . 
the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 ;

order to be effective , the operational activities required a continuous , predictable and assured flow of funds especially towards the least developed countries which were in a desperate economic situation .  
Although resident coordinators had a key role to play , they should be assisted by ensuring that the local representatives of other entities engaged in operational activities consulted them regarding the implementation of major programmes and by authorizing the resident coordinators to propose to the heads of those entities the amendment of country programmes and major projects , where required , to bring them into line with the country strategy note , in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 .  
the geographic coverage of operational activities had been extended to the CIS countries and their scope now also included administrative reform , the defence of human rights and elections , and financial resources therefore should have been increased accordingly .

the geographic coverage of operational activities had been extended to the CIS countries and their scope now also included administrative reform , the defence of human rights and elections , and financial resources therefore should have been increased accordingly .  
the absence of precise information concerning the operational requirements of each mission , the cost estimates have been based on the average cost per person per day of military personnel and civilian police derived from the commitment authorization of $ 115,373,000 gross ( $ 113,866,300 net ) provided by the General Assembly for the month of December 1995 .  
special concern , in this regard , has been the need to determine the full extent of Iraq 's programmes and to seek verification of Iraq 's claims to have destroyed all proscribed weapons , in particular its stocks of agent VX and its precursors , operational missile systems , all of its biological warfare agent and all of the aerial bombs and missile warheads that Iraq states it filled with various chemical and biological agents in the period immediately preceding the Gulf War .  
also the initiative by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of establishing a pilot project of the Humanitarian Early Warning System , with the purpose of identifying potential crises with humanitarian implications through the analysis of its database , and welcoming further the establishment by the Department of Political Affairs , the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of interdepartmental consultations for the joint analysis of early warning of looming crises , within a broader framework for the coordination of operational planning and implementation among the three departments ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to make available additional human and financial resources to enhance the capability of the High Commissioner and of the Centre to fulfil effectively their respective mandates and their ability to carry out mandated operational activities and to coordinate efficiently with other relevant parts of the United Nations system on logistical and administrative questions , having due regard to the need to finance and implement activities of the United Nations related to development ;  
Moreover , as technology and social , economic and political change transform the world , managerial knowledge , skills and tools , which were once sufficient to maintain operational efficiency and performance of the public administration system , no longer satisfy the basic needs of government .  
Despite differences or variances in legal systems , there was general agreement that extant laws governing administrative systems are too many and are redundant ; enforcement is slow , and some laws simply can not be implemented for a variety of reasons : lack of resources , operational or resource constraints , irrelevance or inapplicability of prevailing conditions .  
The imperatives of reducing budget deficits and the desire to achieve operational efficiency shared by us all could not possibly be the basis for a universal conclusion favouring the diminishment of the State or the systematic dismantling of public administration at the cost of inviting the disruption of networks that provide structure and sustenance to economic and social life in many developing countries .  
The International Tribunal set up to identify agents of genocide living abroad has not been effective , as it has been crippled by organizational , financial and operational obstacles .

In preparation for legislative elections held in June , August and September 1995 and the presidential elections of December 1995 , the technical team coordinated a large civic education programme and undertook , inter alia , the preparation of an electoral budget and coordination of financial support through a United Nations trust fund established for that purpose ; preparation of an operational and logistical plan , and assistance in its implementation ; and support in the design of a communication plan and a deployment plan for registration and voting periods .  
In that regard , it was not clear whether the reform of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) that had been proposed by its Administrator focused on the level of resources or on the Programme 's efficiency , and he wondered whether that process would be reviewed by the Governing Council , and whether the Administrator 's initiative concerning the reform of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations was a personal initiative or was part of a review of the level of resources to be allocated to operational activities for development in future .  
The issue of resources for operational activities , however , was particularly important because , in the view of her delegation , if resources could not be increased on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , the effectiveness of such activities would be seriously impaired , developing countries ' development programmes would be jeopardized and , in the long run , international development cooperation would be affected .  
Mr . GALVARRO ( Bolivia ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , emphasized the importance of operational activities for development as a fundamental factor in seconding the efforts of the developing countries and highlighted the necessity of increasing contributions to United Nations funds and programmes as a means of revitalizing international cooperation for development , in particular , the achievement by donor countries of the targets set for ODA and the provision of such resources on a continuing , timely , assured and predictable basis . 
The General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights , in their repeated resolutions , have recognized the enhanced functioning of the operational presence of the Centre for Human Rights in Cambodia and have requested the Secretary-General to ensure adequate resources from within existing United Nations resources .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
His delegation shared the belief that the programme resource requirements for operational activities for development should be granted due priority and supported the idea that the system resources previously allocated to outdated and low priority programmes should be reallocated to economic development with an emphasis on realistic project evaluation , strict performance compliance and strengthened oversight and investigation capabilities to preempt fraud and the mismanagement of the dwindling resources of the Organization .  
This is because while members of national military contingents discharge international functions and serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations under the operational control of the Organization , no direct contractual or statutory relationship exists between them and the United Nations ; the terms and conditions of their assignment to the United Nations peacekeeping operations are set out in bilateral agreements and / or understandings entered into between the Organization and their respective Governments . a / General Assembly resolution 50 / 217 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls on members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine as a matter of priority options and proposals to improve its functioning ;

It acts with its partners in the international community to assist in meeting the operational challenges of migration ; to advance understanding of migration issues ; to encourage social and economic development through migration ; and to work towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  
The IOM budget is composed of an administrative part , funded by assessed contributions from all member States according to an agreed percentage scale and an operational part funded wholly by voluntary contributions from Governments and multilateral and private sources .  
The European Union is convinced that the role of the United Nations in the field of development activities would be substantially strengthened if the three secretariat departments with responsibilities in this area were to be merged under the authority of a single Under-Secretary-General responsible for policy formulation and coordination in the fields of sustainable development and economic cooperation , while coherence and coordination of operational activities should also be appropriately enhanced through the strengthening of the relevant secretariat function .  
It supported proposals which allowed the Secretariat to have a greater capacity to conduct feasibility studies of options for the consideration of the Security Council ; translate mandates into achievable concepts of operations ; provide timely advice and support to the field and meaningful feedback to the Security Council ; and develop doctrines and operational concepts , standing operational procedures and related common terminology for United Nations peacekeeping operations .  
Although the establishment of a rapidly deployable mission headquarters was a constructive step , it would not be a panacea for the range of problems experienced in previous United Nations peacekeeping missions ; it would provide operational and planning improvements , however , and would enable the United Nations to deploy more quickly to the field a well-prepared and jointly trained team of military and civilian personnel in the most critical phase of peacekeeping operations .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls on members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine as a matter of priority options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Also commends the work of the United Nations Development Fund for Women in providing a strategic and focused response to the follow-up and implementation of the Platform for Action through its advocacy and operational activities in support of women 's economic and political empowerment , and encourages the Fund to provide technical support to operationalize the Platform for Action at the national level through , inter alia , the resident coordinator system , and taking into account decision 1996 / 43 of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme / United Nations Population Fund ;

Kenya shares the legitimate concerns of many Member States regarding the need to minimize the operational costs of the institutions we have created and to adopt an evolutionary and cost-effective approach that takes into account the increasing financial difficulties of Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  We believe , however , that it is crucial for the international community to provide these new institutions with sufficient resources to enable them to discharge their important functions .  
Recalling further that the International Organization for Migration assists in meeting the operational challenges of migration and that it is committed to the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society , advancing understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development through migration and to working towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants ,  
In pursuing cases with regard to trafficking and forced prostitution , the police are compelled to rely on diverse sources for information , such as Interpol , border guards , police operational activities and investigations into organized crime , diplomatic representations abroad , families looking for missing persons , clients of victims and victims themselves .  
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] in particular of the attention paid by the Secretary-General to effectiveness , accountability and transparency in humanitarian assistance under increasingly complex operational environments and the need for further efforts to identify and support the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , Taking note of the establishment , within the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , of Reliefweb , for the dissemination of reliable and timely information on natural disasters and other emergencies ,  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Calls upon developing , developed and other countries , their intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as well as the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , to give their full support to the effective implementation of the technical cooperation among developing countries framework , including support for innovative national , regional and interregional programmes and projects and the expanded utilization of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality in the operational activities for development of the United Nations system ;  
On the basis of the cooperation agreement signed in 1976 between the two intergovernmental institutions , and strengthened in 1990 by an additional protocol creating a joint consultative commission , joint operational activities are regularly carried out by UNESCO and the Agency in the areas of basic education , education for adults , and after-school education the very foundations of an economic and social development that truly takes into account the human dimension of progress .  
Countries with limited mineral resources , like Armenia , will continue to view the International Atomic Energy Agency as the central medium for the safeguarded transfer of nuclear technology , operational expertise , and technical assistance to countries which explicitly adhere to international non-proliferation objectives and comply with the existing regulations .  
As Japan has long advocated that the Department of Humanitarian Affairs remain faithful to its function as a strategic centre for coordination and that it refrain from becoming involved in the operational field of humanitarian activities , it welcomes such an orientation , and is confident that , with its new and streamlined functions , the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator , together with the strengthened Inter-Agency Standing Committee ( IASC ) , will contribute to an effective response to humanitarian crises .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The four specific action areas laid out in the mission statement - operational assistance , advancement of understanding of the issues , encouragement of social and economic development through migration , and upholding the human dignity and well-being of migrants - permeate the Programme of Action , too , and provide a solid basis for IOM 's institutional commitment to moving the international consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development towards concrete action .  
An international collaborative research initiative , PLEC is based on a comparative network of locally based research clusters ; five are now operational in West Africa , East Africa , Montane Mainland South-East Asia , Papua New Guinea and Amazonia , and a sixth is being developed in the Caribbean region .  
Reporting to the Senior Demobilization Officer the incumbent would ( a ) coordinate field operations , including direction of their day-to-day operations ; ( b ) supervise regional demobilization officers and health and child soldier coordinators ; ( c ) manage and ensure timely availability and delivery of resources to demobilization sites ; ( d ) ensure that demobilization centres operate according to standard operational procedures ; and ( e ) participate in planning and policy development and catalyse efficient use of resources in the field . a Contribution for humanitarian assistance only .

Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
In order to assist countries in need and to render more operational its technical assistance activities , the Division , as requested by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1996 / 27 , will also develop a training manual for specialized law enforcement and investigative personnel on action against organized transnational crime .  
Recommendations to address these constraints included : ( a ) identifying promotional messages for SHD to be used by all staff in contacts with the media at seminars and other venues ; ( b ) improving links between the staff working in policy , substantive and operational matters and those in media ; ( c ) encouraging all staff to invest time in developing and communicating clear messages on the role and activities of UNDP ; and ( d ) allocating increased funding from the organizational budget for communication and advocacy efforts .  
In all UNDP operational oversight bodies , increasing attention is being paid to the clarity of programme objectives , the extent to which lessons learned have been incorporated into substantive programme design , and the inclusion of adequate performance indicators and managerial arrangements for monitoring and evaluation .  
That resolution reaffirmed the priority of the Programme ( para . 3 ) , requested the Secretary-General to strengthen it further by providing it with the resources necessary for the full implementation of its mandate ( para . 6 ) , called upon States and United Nations and other international , regional and national funding agencies to make significant financial contributions for operational activities of the Programme , and encouraged all States to make voluntary contributions for that purpose to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund .  
First of all , in the view of ACC members , the report does not take sufficient account of the broad variety of NGOs , whose roles , operational procedures and financial requirements are quite different , ranging from large international organizations to national support NGOs and representative peoples ' organizations .  
The general thrust of this recommendation , namely , the need for more active involvement of national NGOs in the country 's economic and social development , is strongly supported by ACC members , since all the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , especially those with operational activities , are well aware of all the benefits of NGO contributions to building equitable and stable societies . 
Accordingly , it is proposed that the budget should include both an annual provision for the normal operational costs of the library and provision to meet the start-up costs of the library , that is , funds for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treatises , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate . 
An important dimension implicit in regional and subregional operational activities , that of the practice and potential for technical cooperation among developing countries , needs to be made more explicit so that more opportunities for such cooperation can be exploited .  
Reaffirming that the initiative on the pilot management scheme presented by the ECLAC secretariat is aimed at strengthening the role of the organization as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ,  
In the absence of a purposeful government programme of national reconciliation and effective police security throughout Croatia , UNHCR and UNTAES agree that all potential returnees should be encouraged to use the operational procedures to be assured of their full rights to reconstruction assistance , social benefits and security .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The General Assembly is encouraged to direct all of its committees and bodies and draw the attention of other bodies of the United Nations system to the need to mainstream a gender perspective systematically into all areas of their work , in particular in areas such as macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters ( para .  12 ) .  
The ability of the United Nations to react in a timely , efficient and effective manner , often at short notice , underpins the need for an integrated operational concept from which subsequent strategies can be developed and implemented .  
It should be noted that the aforementioned resources are in addition to very considerable contributions from third-party sources for UNDP country programmes , in particular from the Governments of Sweden and Norway ; contributions from those two States have been decisive for United Nations actions in support of peace processes and the consolidation of democracy in Central America and have included direct contributions for improving the analytical and operational capacities of UNDP country offices in Nicaragua , El Salvador , Guatemala and , recently , Honduras . 
All three of these operational programmes are supporting the development of environmentally sound , renewable sources of commercial energy with demonstrated viability and the improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 .

In view of the fact that conditions for its entry into force are not subject to revision , we have to consider seriously a set of measures to provide for the timely implementation of the Treaty , since it is not impossible that a technologically perfect , though expensive , CTBT verification system will be established and ready to function while the Treaty itself is still not operational .  
The inter-agency consolidated appeals will reflect to a greater extent all operational activities performed by humanitarian agencies in specific situations and activities included in appeals will , pursuant to joint consultations , be listed in accordance with the priorities given .  
He welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the operational framework for the International Year ( A / 52 / 328 ) , paragraph 43 of which stressed that the promotion of active ageing in developing countries needed technical and financial international support .

These national services , working collaboratively in real time , provide the unique operational capabilities of the World Weather Watch of the World Meteorological Organisation ( WMO ) , a coordinated international system of national meteorological and hydrological services that is based on the common acceptance of protocols and standard terminology .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
In an indicative list , the Council identified macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters as areas where gender mainstreaming needs to be pursued systematically .  
During the same period , in 1994 , additional work and project changes were requested by ECA , which , inter alia , included electrical , mechanical and special system requirements such as additional and uninterruptible power supply , building automated control system and anti-intrusion security .  Some of these changes were the result of modified user requirements , or for greater operational efficiency , and to take advantage of changes in technology since the original design was drawn , for example innovations in fibre optics .  
Recognizes that the White Helmets , as an operational partner of the United Nations Volunteers , are an efficient and viable mechanism for making pre-identified and trained homogenous teams available to the United Nations system , in support of immediate relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development activities , in the light of the increasing number and growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies ;  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
Urges the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , and invites other relevant intergovernmental organizations involved in international development cooperation , to make concerted and vigorous efforts to mainstream the implementation of modalities of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries by giving them full consideration in the design , formulation , implementation and evaluation of programmes and projects in their operational activities ;  
To that end , the Government is strongly encouraged to consider taking appropriate steps to develop a legal and institutional framework for public broadcasting to ensure that the State-financed broadcasting media can operate effectively as a public service broadcaster , with full guarantees of editorial and operational independence from Government and all other political influence on programming content .  
Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
While acknowledging that the various working groups within the Organization were dealing with individual aspects of this problem , the sponsor noted that they were doing so in a context and manner which were primarily political and operational in nature , whereas the Special Committee , being a body with highly qualified legal expertise , was best suited for dealing with the mere legal aspects of the matter , which were the subject of the proposed declaration .  
The total for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997 was 7,793.14 The Committee was informed that this total included posts for support services and substantive activities ( including posts financed from operational funds posted at established United Nations offices and posts financed from the support account for peacekeeping operations ) .  
The Centre established a comprehensive data base on non-governmental organizations and other partners active in human settlements and is expanding its programme with those partners which had participated actively in the Habitat II preparatory process and had organized their own forums and presented their declarations and commitments to Committee II of the Conference . 11 .  At the present time , the main operational activity of the Centre in relation to the Global Strategy for Shelter , is the application of the urban and housing indicators .  
The present stage requires that we make effective use of every achievement by guiding United Nations action in an innovative and practical direction , based on operational legal aspects of multilateral activities against terrorism .  
In order to put an end to this distressing situation , Africa 's development partners should envisage a comprehensive and integrated mechanism for flexible , operational and effective financing , free of bureaucratic impediments and red tape , with the aim of establishing a centralized funding entity to receive resources from all sources to be devoted to economic and social development .  
The elements of the ANAD peacekeeping force would be coordinated in predetermined tactical or logistical modules in a state of operational readiness on their respective territories and could be sent into action at short notice .  
The Organization 's unrivalled role in the field of development , whether analytical , normative or operational , and in contributing to the creation of a favourable international milieu for development , hardly needs to be emphasized .  
Declares , therefore , that ECLAC should function as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ;  
In the law enforcement sector , UNDCP supported operational and investigative training , providing selected equipment to law enforcement agencies and assisting in establishing and improving the functioning of national drug control coordinating bodies , particularly in Brazil , Cuba and Ecuador and in other countries in Central America and the Caribbean .  
Generally , small island developing States face inordinate operational difficulties because of inadequate technically qualified human resources , poor infrastructure and installation , and deficient planning .  
It also runs specific projects related to : the use of infrared imagery for public agencies , academic and other research institutions ; thermal loss in urban areas ; and the use of NOAA satellite images for the operational definition of cloud systems .  
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 63 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and stressed the need to continue to improve the operational activities of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States , at their request , for support in crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Further , despite pressure from staff in the Office of the Prosecutor and from both Prosecutors to provide day-to-day operational leadership as the senior officer , the Deputy Prosecutor did not assume the role : the Office continued to operate without sufficient staff and other resources ; without sufficient staff prosecutors who possessed enough relevant legal experience to direct the investigations and to prepare and conduct the trials ; and without critical day-to-day operational guidance . 
In addition to being flexible , any new system of desirable ranges should meet a number of operational requirements ; such a system , inter alia , should produce predictable and verifiable results , be easy to administer and be transparent .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls upon members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine , as a matter of priority , options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
The technology involved in the processing and interpretation of digital satellite information and data obtained on the ground for the purposes of evaluation of crop condition and yield \ x { e8ca } echnology which is applied in an experimental operational system ( in a real-time regime ) \ x { e8c3 } akes it possible during the vegetation growing period to make a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the state of crops in 25 regions of the Russian Federation .  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area , and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
These efforts towards reorganization reflect the common understanding that in order to provide objective , impartial and candid assessments , the audit unit has to be granted an adequate measure of operational independence from the entities subject to its scrutiny .  
This could be achieved through a summary report which would be compiled and coordinated by the Office of Internal Oversight Services and submitted to the General Assembly in accordance with paragraph 5 ( e ) ( ii ) of resolution 48 / 218 B . The report would be based on submissions from the operational funds and programmes which would be forwarded to the Office by their executive heads after discussion and approval , as appropriate , by the respective governing bodies . 
However , it is something that the Commission on Human Rights must not overlook and it has to be solved on the basis of more in _ depth knowledge of the facts , specific references and a systematic analysis concluding with suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational standards relating to mercenary activities and to companies which sell security internationally . 
As indicated in the report on follow-up to the decisions taken by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1996 , CCPOQ , with considerable substantive and financial assistance from UNDP , published an operational activities reference manual , which has now been forwarded to all country offices and will serve as a unifying framework within which each agency will operate using its own detailed operational procedures .  
Upon inquiry , the Committee was also informed that constant use related to operational activities of the Force , coupled with the extensive distances over rough mountainous roads , have resulted in vehicles registering well above the standard replacement criteria - these being 5 years or 120,000 km for civilian-pattern vehicles , jeeps , light trucks and minibuses ; 8 years or 135,000 km for ambulances , medium or heavy buses , and trucks up to 4 tons ; 10 years or 250,000 km for heavy buses and trucks , and truck tractors over 4 tons .  
While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
In the inter-agency follow-up to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 56 of 28 July 1995 , agencies agreed that a lead agency might be designated to carry out the functions of operational coordination for a specific target group , geographical area or technical sector ; and that the lead agency would be accountable to the resident / humanitarian coordinator . 
United Nations observations conducted in 87 schools and a detailed infrastructure survey by UNICEF in mid-1997 of an additional 150 schools showed a severe shortage of desks , resulting in an average of four pupils sharing a desk for two and approximately 50 per cent of the students sitting on the floor , lack of teaching aids , buildings in dilapidated condition and a lack of operational water and sanitation facilities .  
In view of Egypt 's perception of the important and vital role of the United Nations and the significance of its operational activities in bringing stability and providing support for national institutions that operate in the developing countries in the sphere of national reconciliation , we stress here the relevance of supporting the efforts of President Preval to overcome the political crisis facing Haiti , and that attainment of final resolutions of the main areas of dispute among the political actors , namely , elections , economic reform and the appointment of a new Prime Minister .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries ;  
While continuing to expand and strengthen its existing web of bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties with other States , Canada also supported the effective implementation by Member States of the measures contained in international legal instruments , as well as the useful practical and operational measures recommended at various international forums .  
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on the operational requirements that necessitated the increase in troops over the authorized level and was informed that the average troop strength exceeded authorized strength by 166 in May 1996 and by 132 in June 1996 owing to the fact that the repatriation of the former UNCRO engineering battalion had to be postponed to the end of June 1996 , since engineering support was needed to complete the installation of military camps . 
The activities will also aim at ( a ) providing the United Nations , the international relief community and potential recipient countries with an operational tool giving access to the exact , reliable and up-to-date data on the existing disaster management capacities that can be called upon at short notice in case of emergency ; and ( b ) creating conditions for the United Nations system and the international community as a whole by facilitating their access to the required emergency humanitarian aid and its expeditious delivery to the disaster-affected population .  
It concluded that the resource targets , including existing operational practices and levels of financing and operational and administrative costs , were not based on quantifiable needs of recipient countries , and that there were no workable methods available at the global level .  
Further , in paragraph 5 of the same resolution , it strongly reaffirmed that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
Four projects on formulation of technical assistance projects that can enhance economic cooperation among developing countries through the exchange of experiences and know-how and the sharing of methods of production , identification of technical assistance needs by integration groupings in the field and searches for practical and operational solutions , development of a cadre of trained negotiators in international commercial diplomacy and mobilization of funds for the financing of operational activities ; 
While there is no commonly accepted definition of what good governance , or " capable " government , means in operational terms , at the very least it signifies the existence of a stable and relatively open and transparent political framework that is representative of , and responsive to , the will of the people .  
Although no concerted move has yet been made by the system to set up the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline data necessary for a comprehensive impact evaluation of operational activities , there have been extensive efforts within JCGP to prepare a common country assessment that , once established , could provide basic data against which progress could be measured .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
As indicated in the report on follow-up to the decisions taken by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1996 , CCPOQ , with considerable substantive and financial assistance from UNDP , published an operational activities reference manual , which has now been forwarded to all country offices and will serve as a unifying framework within which each agency will operate using its own detailed operational procedures .  
They included publication and dissemination of notices of stolen cultural property based on the information received from the national central bureaus of the States members of Interpol , the organization of meetings for police officers and the development of a new international database on stolen cultural objects which , he said , would be operational by the end of 1996 . 
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
The Fund has maintained a solid financial standing and has been utilized by operational organizations of the United Nations system on 48 occasions to meet urgent relief requirements .  
Gravely concerned that the persistent insufficiency and decline of resources for operational activities for development , in particular of core resources , is seriously affecting the priorities and the capacity of the United Nations funds and programmes to carry out their functions and to respond effectively to the increasing needs of all developing countries , as well as seriously eroding their fundamental mandates and characteristics , particularly their universal and multilateral character ,  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
Reaffirms that the objective of capacity-building and its sustainability should continue to be an essential part of the operational activities of the United Nations system at the country level and should be country-driven and situation specific , and should be based on the programme approach , to the extent possible , consistent with national development plans and priorities ;  
At the operational level , the United Nations Special Commission has continued its tasks of verifying the destruction of Iraq 's proscribed weapons and capabilities and of operating a system of ongoing monitoring of its compliance with its obligation not to acquire such weapons or capabilities in the future ( see S / 1997 / 301 , annex ) .  
As a sign of Sweden 's continuing commitment to the work of the United Nations in the economic and social fields , the Swedish Government in its budget bill to the Parliament for 1997 - in spite of cuts in almost all other areas of government expenditure - was proposing a maintained total level of voluntary contributions to the Organization 's operational activities .  
These mechanisms consist , among others , of annual financial reports , semi-annual reports , quarterly reports , audited reports by internal and external auditors , field visits by agency personnel , regular monitoring by geographical desks , narrative reports on progress , regular operational reporting and meetings , as well as mid-term and final reports on activities and finance ( see table 6 below ) . 
In order to be operational , however , such a global model should comprise large-scale national models that should be designed to cover domestic economy , external sector and supply-side response to external shocks such as coercive economic measures .  
The existence within the programme of both normative functions ( funded by the regular budget ) and operational technical cooperation activities ( funded by the Fund of UNDCP ) permits a synergy of action : technical expertise that supports the normative work provides a valuable underpinning for technical cooperation activities , and operational activities provide an important source of experience in putting international norms into practice .  10 .  In its resolution 14 ( XXXVIII ) , the Commission requested the Executive Director to indicate the relationship between mandates and budgetary allocations .  
IPA will be promoted through various means : first , by ensuring that inter-ministerial national drug-control commissions are fully involved in operational activities , thus strengthening their coordination and planning functions ; secondly , by promoting planning and operational linkages with Governments , agencies in the United Nations system , international financial institutions , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations through the incorporation of the drug dimension into mainstream socio-economic development programmes ; and thirdly , by fostering broader social awareness of the deleterious political , social and economic consequences of drug abuse and the illicit drug industry .  
Equally important to both recipients and donors are the knowledge derived by UNDCP from its functions in the field of international treaty implementation and related advisory services , the capacity to adapt to local circumstances a wide range and variety of methodologies and best practices developed under pilot projects throughout the world , and its experience in working with counterparts in defining , planning and implementing operational activities at national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
Finally , for module four , covering demand reduction , the following areas will be of main interest : establishment of a subregional coordination mechanism at policy and operational levels ; harmonization of legislation ; promotion of information exchange at the subregional level ; assessment of illicit demand and sharing of experience in prevention and treatment ; joint training activities ; and harmonization of licit control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors .  
Finally , at the regional level , joint training in investigation techniques ( profiling , search methods , controlled deliveries etc . ) will be organized , and a framework for periodic consultations on operational issues ( trends , concealment methods etc . ) will be set up .  
Specifically , operational activities at national , subregional and regional levels addressed : preventive education for high risk groups ( school children , street children ) ; prevention for intravenous drug abusers to contain the spread of HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases ; implementation of common standards for epidemiological monitoring and systems of information on drug abuse ; prevention of drug abuse in the workplace ; and training for rehabilitation and integration of former drug addicts into society , involving health and education authorities .  
The activities of UNDCP in supply reduction and law enforcement should mean that by the end of the biennium 1998-1999 , closer working links will have been established with Interpol , WCO and Europol ; a global programme on law enforcement measures relating to precursor control will be operational ; a clearer understanding of effective methods of alternative development and monitoring of illicit crops will have been gained ; and high quality , timely analytical data relating to seizures of illicit drugs will be available to Member States and to other organizations .  
Objective : to extend the knowledge base for understanding the international drug problem so that Member States can make more informed policy choices , and so that UNDCP can be more proactive in identifying changes and forecasting trends , and can strengthen its position as a centre of expertise , all of which would contribute to helping fulfill the complementary normative and operational functions of UNDCP .  
Weather forecasts based on numerical weather prediction utilize , among other things , operational satellite measurements of both surface and upper air winds and atmospheric temperature fields ;  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
The review concluded that the UNOPS operational reserve , initially established at a level equal to 20 per cent of the annual administrative budget , was insufficient to match the risks to which UNOPS is exposed as a self-financing operational entity .  
Peacekeeping operations with a humanitarian component were increasingly coming to the fore , and raised a number of difficult political , legal and operational problems .  
Strongly reaffirming the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ,  
In the ensuing discussion , delegations focused on the following key issues : the biennial support budget ; the level of the operational reserve ; funds from private foundations ; the national execution modality ; and unpaid contributions .  
The FAO assessment will be forward looking , and will be carried out in the light of the basic principles and operational guidelines published by FAO in 1996 , as well as the specific elements to be considered during the development and implementation of national forest programmes , as endorsed by IPF ( see E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) .  
Follow-up action has focused on the preparation of teaching materials and the translation of the United Nations standards on criminal justice in the national language for law enforcement officials , examining current penal and banking legislation and creating an effective implementing mechanism , strengthening analytical and operational capabilities , improving inter-ministerial cooperation and enhancing international mutual assistance . 
By contrast , the responsibility of RDMHQ would be to convert the concept and operational plans into usable theatre - and tactical-level plans and operational orders ; to prepare associated standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) ; and to act as an advance headquarters within a mission area during the initial months when swift deployment may be crucial to long-term success .  
The steps already taken by the executive boards of United Nations funds and programmes should be built upon to arrest and reverse the decline in core resources and enhance the effectiveness of operational activities in various ways , including a substantial increase in their funding that would commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  If the current deplorable situation was allowed to continue , there would be a drastic reduction in United Nations operational activities .  
Strongly reaffirms that the impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and the parts relevant to operational activities for development of resolution 52 / 12 B ;  
Such assessments require a political grasp of the clash of parties , values and interests in the mission area , as well as a solid military , logistical and administrative understanding of the risks , costs and means required for operational effectiveness .  
The Department acts as the operational arm of the Secretary-General for United Nations peacekeeping operations and has primary responsibility for managing , directing and supporting all mandated peacekeeping operations and for providing administrative and logistics support to good offices , preventive diplomacy , peacemaking and humanitarian missions , as required .  
In order to achieve the goals agreed by both developing and developed countries at the United Nations global conferences , it was necessary to establish an integrated set of indicators against which progress could be evaluated at the policy and operational levels in such areas as poverty , gender equality , environmental sustainability and access to primary health care and primary education .  
The Seventh Meeting of States Parties in 1997 approved in principle the ongoing need during the first five years to appropriate a sum of $ 60,000 per year to meet the operational costs and $ 60,000 per year for the " start-up costs " of the library , i.e . , resources for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treaties , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate .  
While other agencies had long faced problems in choosing legitimate or representative partners in the private sector , those partners were usually non-profit bodies , whereas working on operational projects with profit-seeking partners was clearly more problematic ; association with the United Nations could be interpreted as giving an unfair commercial advantage over its competitors , national and international . 
By the Governments decision , the National Council for Womens Affairs , headed by a Cabinet member , the Minister for Health and Social Welfare , was established at the end of 1996 , and its operational by-laws were accordingly adopted . the Council is made up of MPs , officials of ministries concerned , representatives of womens non-governmental organizations , voluntary movements , mass organizations , owners of private companies , business and cooperative entities . 
On the basis of the current formula , the operational reserve was set at the level of $ 200-million in 1997 and would be calculated for the biennium 1998-1999 at the level of $ 180-million , based on the resource projection presented to the Executive Board in the annual review of the financial situation , 1997 ( DP / 1998 / 29 ) .  
The objectives of these conferences were to improve the scientific understanding of and the ability to predict the environmental and societal impacts of the phenomena , and to define improved operational and institutional approaches to reducing damage from future occurrences .  
At a meeting with me , on 11 December 1998 , an ECOWAS ministerial delegation on the Guinea-Bissau issues reiterated that ECOWAS needed logistical and financial support in order to proceed with the speedy deployment of the ECOMOG interposition force , the key operational support instrument for the implementation of the Agreement on the ground .  The delegation emphasized the importance of United Nations / ECOWAS collaboration and asked me to appoint a representative in that country .  
Therefore the primary focus of operational activities must continue to be at the country level , with national Governments assuming the main responsibility for coordinating development assistance programming , which , in turn , must be based on the national development plans and priorities of those countries .  
Since the most recent triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , coordination had greatly improved , the resident coordinator system had been strengthened and cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions in such areas as humanitarian assistance , post-conflict peace-building and regional-level operations had increased .  
The General Assembly should take a position on the future pledging mechanism , either in a separate resolution or as part of its general decision on the triennial policy review ; Ukraine supported the establishment of such a mechanism provided that the universal , voluntary and grant nature of United Nations operational activities was maintained .  
Given the limited staffing capacity of the Service , its operations are more reactive than proactive : a greater focus on Headquarters strategic planning and staff resource management would lead to improved service delivery and increased effectiveness in meeting operational and administrative needs in the field .  
The most noteworthy aspect of the results of the survey ( March 1999 ) is that , despite progress in operational terms , which resulted in a near doubling of the maximum penetration achieved in the previous survey , the geological substratum sought in certain critical areas in the central part of the strait has still not been detected .  
Although complex politico-military developments in Angola during the period under review have placed additional strain on the material and human assets of the Observer Mission , resources provided by the General Assembly for this period proved to be adequate to meet MONUAs operational requirements .  
As indicated in paragraph 73 , as well as in table 3 , of the report of the Secretary-General , it is anticipated that , when the proposed enhanced system becomes operational , total biennial communications expenditures of the United Nations under the regular budget would amount to $ 12.5-million-4 / as compared to $ 16.1-million , and that , in respect of peace-keeping operations , current biennial expenditures for communications , which amount to $ 22.8-million , would be reduced to $ 7.2-million .  
The Commission focuses its analytical work on designing public policies and facilitates the implementation of such policies , concentrating operational services in the areas of specialized information , advisory assistance , training and support for regional and international cooperation .  
During the biennium 20002001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will focus on further promoting and coordinating the development of a common principled policy on humanitarian issues and on improving the management and practice of operational and strategic coordination through the development of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned and accountability reviews .  
Pursuant to resolution 1201 ( 1998 ) , by which the Security Council mandated MINURCA to support the conduct of legislative elections in the Central African Republic in November and December 1998 , operational plans developed by MINURCA called for the deployment for a period of 2.5 months of an additional 21 international and 18 local staff , 94 medium and short-term electoral observers and for the provision of related additional air , transportation and communications assets .  
For operational reasons , in view of a substantial quantity of military-pattern equipment provided to the MINURCA military contingents by the Government of France as a voluntary contribution in kind , increased provisions are also made for the supply under letter-of-assist arrangements of essential required spare parts and other matriel required to maintain those assets .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that in view of the continuing operational requirements of the Mission with regard to engineering and logistical support of its activities , in particular the maintenance of the three mission-owned base camps and the logistics complex in Laayoune , it was considered necessary to retain the Engineering and Logistics Sections in the organizational structure of the Mission , headed by Professional staff at the P-4 and P-3 levels , respectively .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 4,571,900 gross ( $ 4,275,100 net ) resulted from reduced requirements as follows : military personnel costs ( $ 83,000 ) , civilian personnel costs ( $ 4,368,400 ) , operational costs ( $ 2,247,300 ) and staff assessment ( $ 296,800 ) ; these were offset by additional requirements amounting to $ 2,423,600 as follows : other programmes ( $ 19,300 ) and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ( $ 2,404,300 ) ( A / 53 / 908 , annex II ) .  
Global programmes of action do provide overall blueprints for the activities in the various field of development initiatives , but they still need to be translated into a coordinated and integrated set of national normatives to be made operational at the country level ( for more detailed information on progress made towards an integrated and coordinated follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , see E / 1999 / 59 ) .  
The analysis conducted by the General Assembly for the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system in 1998 confirmed that resident coordinators have an important role to play in assisting Governments in their responsibilities for the integrated implementation of the major international conferences .  
Within this context , in addition to the delivery of its regular programme of work , the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) assisted the region in facing the consequences derived from those two sets of events , through a mix of normative activities in the comprehensive analysis of development and public policy - making , and operational activities in the form of technical assistance , specialized information and training .  
Subsequently , the General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 192 , paragraph 41 , stressed the growing need for incorporating the regional and subregional dimension in United Nations operational activities for development , and encouraged resident coordinators , in close consultation with Governments , to secure greater involvement of the regional commissions , taking into account their agreed mandates and work programmes , in UNDAF , as appropriate .  
While the distinction was considered of some use in the interpretation of primary rules in an explanatory , didactic sense , doubts were expressed as to whether it should be included in a codification of the law of State responsibility , and if so , whether it could be made operational at the level of secondary rules .  
This programme aims at defining , developing and implementing a dedicated operational end-to-end satellite remote sensing capacity to provide real-time access to appropriate spatial data for supporting sustainable forest management at the subnational level .  
Nevertheless the Mission should have properly documented the conditions surrounding the acceptance of a fleet of buses that fulfilled the operational requirement but that did not meet the original technical specification , albeit to a much lesser extent than originally reported .  
Plans of action have been established at country operational level , focussing on key areas requiring protection and assistance measures ; sexual exploitation and violence ; under-age military recruitment ; education ; and unaccompanied minors and adolescents ; all of which are fundamental to addressing the needs of girls more effectively .  
The present document is submitted pursuant to Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 , in which the Board requested the Executive Director to report biennially on the appropriateness of the level of the operational reserve of the United Nations Office of Project Services ( UNOPS ) , established in the same decision at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year .  
While sharing the concern expressed by some delegations at the third annual sessions 1997 and 1998 that the 4 per cent level of the reserve may be too low , the Executive Director has concluded that the first priority for UNOPS in the current and next bienniums is the restoration of the operational reserve to its level as presently prescribed .  
If that were so , there would be no need to regulate the functioning of unilateral acts , which were to be understood as autonomous or independent acts with their own distinctive characteristics and were to be distinguished from unilateral acts which fell within the scope of treaties and for which specific operational rules could be formulated .  
Reaffirms that untied core resources are the bedrock of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and , in this context , calls on Governments to take steps to address the urgent and immediate need for a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , reflecting the increasing needs of developing countries , taking into account the development of multi-year funding frameworks ;  
Takes note of the efforts already made to strengthen field-level coordination and the role of the resident coordinator system , and encourages further steps towards greater collaboration , at the field level , by ensuring well _ functioning , highly participatory and active country teams , and full consultation with the Governments concerned , while respecting the specific identities and mandates of United Nations operational activities ;  
The positive impulses for pursuing cross-cutting issues of universal character , such as natural disaster reduction , created on the one hand by a division of labour between non-operational responsibilities for system-wide policy development , advocacy and coordination , and on the other hand , by distinct operational responsibilities for all relevant mandate bearers inside and outside the United Nations , in particular in the field of development .  
It is also considered crucial that the next generation of operational observing systems be designed specifically to meet the more stringent requirements imposed by the need for the detection of climate and global change .  
The common set of rules for ensuring the effective and enhanced operational security of global networks is voluntary owing to the fact that countries have not adopted uniform legislation concerning the operation of information networks .  
In view of the low level of voluntary contributions , the small proportion of the regular budget allocated to technical cooperation , and a fluctuating and inadequate operational budget , additional resources were urgently needed .  
The increasing number of complex emergencies and the involvement of the United Nations in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations have raised the interest not only of the traditional operational partners of the United Nations and non-governmental organizations , but also of research and academic institutions and universities .  This development deserves to be encouraged and fortified .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of the report ( DP / 1999 / 40 ) and the interim financial statements for the year ended 31 December 1998 that UNOPS brought the level of its operational reserve from $ 17.6-million at 31 December 1997 to $ 19.9-million at 31 December 1998 , which is the approved level of 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the prior year ( $ 499.7-million ) in accordance with Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 .  
The progressive narrowing of existing gaps between operational measures and corresponding enabling legislation and institutional frameworks is also being addressed through pilot border-management programmes that target the operational strengthening of immigration control as a practical means of bridging these gaps .  
To achieve greater coherence in global economic policy-making , which is one of the functions of WTO , and make it more operational , WTO rules and disciplines should be taken fully into account by the international financial institutions when designing macroeconomic programmes and rescue packages for individual countries .  
Regional economic and social commissions should become better skilled at developing non-governmental organization relations at the regional and national levels , with a view to constructing policy and operational partnerships at those levels in implementing United Nations decisions and programmes as well as outcomes of international conferences ;  
One of the key aspects of operational activities for development is facilitating the transfer of technology and expanding the access to technological information , and the creation of information flows on affordable and sustainable technology which is suitable to a specific country , establishing information networks with relevant institutions and business firms .  
The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) acts with its partners in the international community to assist in meeting the operational challenges of migration , advance understanding of migration issues , encourage social and economic development through migration , and uphold the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  IOM is involved in all phases of mass exoduses , providing technical and operational expertise in such areas as transportation , health , and other services for migrants .

In canton 6 , based on a full operational review of the Ministry of Interior and all municipal police administrations , UNMIBH has developed a " three-point plan " of concrete steps for the creation of a multi-ethnic , fully integrated professional police force , which is insulated from inappropriate external influences .  
Given the continuing volatile security situation in East Timor , the successor force to INTERFET should have a robust operational mandate .  24 .  As indicated in the first periodic report , it is imperative that urgent steps be taken to address the absence of effective civil administration in East Timor and that the civil administration elements of UNTAET be brought forward as much as possible .  
Since it was essential to consolidate the achievements made by addressing the remaining political and operational issues in a balanced and careful manner , he encouraged the parties concerned to continue their cooperation with the United Nations with a view to creating an enabling atmosphere for the referendum to be held as planned .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
Invites United Nations financial and developmental institutions , operational programmes and the specialized agencies , as well as other regional and international organizations , in accordance with the existing procedures of their governing bodies :  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development ;  
Likewise , in the context of the subsequent municipal elections , OSCE and IOM concluded in 1999 a memorandum of understanding governing the advisory and operational role of IOM with regard to Bosnians living abroad .  
Invites United Nations financial and developmental institutions , operational programmes and the specialized agencies , as well as other regional and international organizations , in accordance with the existing procedures of their governing bodies :

We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
In recent years , although China 's army computer network has developed fairly quickly , the mutual connectivity between agencies at the regimental level and above has been realized in the majority of units .  However , this situation frequently occurs : As soon as operational training meets with emergency circumstances , computers are abandoned and a return to manual operations ensues , and the more fierce the struggle , the more willing one is to return to " re-operating old-style affairs . "  
The present training revolution in the American military is primarily embodied in the use of information , simulation , network , and artificial intelligence technology , and the methods and process in changing training have enabled the troops to receive " full physical and mental " training in simulating the " combined man and machine environment " of real combat .  Before engaging in real fire exercises the troops are already prepared with a fair amount of practice in operational skills , even using simulation to train for weapons systems that have yet to become operational .  
We should strengthen the collection and accumulation of all kinds of operational data , not only collecting complete information on our side , but even more clarifying of detailed reference data and indicators on our operational opponent , particularly on the foremost opponent 's technical equipment , operational theory , battlefield geographical circumstance , and important operational targets .  
At present , the most pressing is to cultivate a unified military and technological database to develop talent , and timely extension of investigation of military strong points and survey of large military areas , constructing precise military-use digital mapping .  Thus we will lay a fine foundation for network troop training and operational simulation .

A simulated trainer jointly developed by them for high-speed target tracking by portable missiles has brought about digitized analog simulation for the training on the operational method for striking extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets and has doubled the speed of target tracking .  
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
This sub-section has taken the lead in conducting this new method of joint tri-service transportation under modern operational conditions in the whole army to meet the needs of future military struggles since the formal initiation of the combined service system .  
The regiment successively built a comprehensive military tactics training ground which integrated the strategy of railway loading and unloading tactics , shooting with light weapons , and positional defense training , and a military officer training center with all functions , built a language teaching room and a simulation training room , introduced a simulation training system with electronic countermeasures and provided a good service guarantee and technical support for reforming the training methods and studying operational methods .  
The training exercise command center on board the vessel , which had been jointly set up by the units of the state organs or military units concerned , had found out or tackled problems through coordination ; had revised in a timely fashion both the measures and steps for the wartime emergency mobilization and requisition of civilian vessels ; and had built a faster and highly efficient operational mechanism during the training exercise .  
Faced with the fierce market competition , a multitude of enterprises have focused their efforts on converting their operational mechanisms , intensifying the reforms within themselves , diverting surplus employees by laying them off in order to improve efficiency , and strengthening and improving enterprise management .  They have made strenuous efforts in ending their predicament and raising their competitiveness as quickly as possible .  
Currently we should put our efforts into in-depth understanding of the specific meaning of preparations for the military struggle in the new period , clarifying the possible specific operational tasks and operational modes we might carry out , and completing training and training the troops to elite status .  
Military units have been supplied with some new equipment now .  To make the equipment combat effective , leaders at all levels should first make theoretical breakthroughs , master the operational theories and detailed rules for examining the new equipment , and lead the military units to complete basic training and explore new experience .  
With series of new characteristics , such as modern joint campaigns , accelerated tempo of operational progress , large consumption of equipment materials , hyperspace , real time , diversified targets , highly efficient means , and intensive management of resources , mobile support tasks will be more arduous .  
Under the order of their commander , officers and men on an array of combat vehicles which are equipped with devices that have been developed and innovated with high technology are successfully blocking attacks launched by precision-guidance weapons against vital targets ; the operational methods they are employing includes " causing confusion by forming a block with scattered laser absorption , causing confusion with simulated intelligence-based infrared rays , causing confusion by misguiding using the positioning system , and creating spoofing confusion with radar evasion " . .  
The division has also gradually established and refined through constant explorations an operational application system , a cadre and backbone training system , a training and support system , and a comprehensive assessment system , and has thus brought about profound changes for essential elements of fighting capacity in each and every aspect and enhanced its all-round operational capability by a large margin .  
Examples are building early-warning and preventive mechanisms , forming an APEC financial early-warning group ( composed of finance ministers of major economies and financial experts ) , enhancing macroeconomic coordination , establishing emergency financial assistance mechanisms , enacting APEC rules for financial activities , supervising the flow of large amounts of capital in the region , and setting up financial personnel training organizations to raise the financial operational and management ability of developing economies .  
Since our army 's network and website building is still at such a primary stage as network personnel handling military issues and the majority of our army 's qualified personnel are still of technical support in nature and have yet to extensively develop or apply the existing hardware or software system in terms of functions and in light of operational decision , command , and tactic , faced with the fast advent of information warfare and network warfare , our army should make further efforts to carry out follow-up research ; explore countermeasures ; 
Our military personnel also had to rely on domestically made gas masks .  As far as this aspect is concerned , our armed forces now have a series of advanced protective equipment , which is suitable to the physiological feature of all ethnic groups in China and which meets various operational needs .  In addition , China also has a group of world-renowned experts on poison protection .  
With the deepening of the reform of naval training in recent years , the trend of training troops by high-tech means is advancing with the force of gusty winds and surging waves .  New types of warships and combat planes that were included into the battle array during the Ninth Five-Year Plan have basically become combat effective .  The Navy has put great emphasis on operational and combined-arms tactical training for combined operations .  
The rapid development of modern aircraft-borne weapons systems ; the surface-to-air missile units which are capable of reaching high-precision hit rates , fast operational response , wide shooting ranges and multiple targets ; and the anti-aircraft artillery units have formed into an air defense system of crossing firepower at high , medium-high , and low altitudes .  
In the exercise of " continuous attacks by submarines against an enemy frigate formation " organized by the base in early November , commanders of the " Red " and the " Blue " sides carried out confrontations without giving advance notice on their operational intentions .  Strong winds and heavy storms happened to be ragging at the sea area where the drill was conducted .  Large sea waves and low visibility increased the difficulty of spotting the targets .  
In light of the operational characteristics of missile vessels and the technical and tactical levels of their attacks , it intensified training in such difficult areas as twin planes ' minimum altitude attacks and interception .  
According to reports , Russia , in addition to taking active and passive defensive measures in developing its satellite systems , is also developing its antisatellite weapons on the basis of the operational antisatellite satellites , which the former Soviet Union developed , and on the basis of testing the land-based antisatellite laser weapons .  
A certain unit in the navy has actively explored adapting to the new path of future warfare , characterized by rapid and cross-territory emergency support logistics , realizing the two great leaps of changing from the one type of solitary missile support unit of the past to multiple series and multiple types of missile support , and from transferring missiles from reserves for support into direct provision of real-fire missile support to operational troops .  This has enabled the troops ' missile support capability to manifest historic changes .  
This is really a sorrowful reality .  At a time when " the overall situation is set and it is not far away , " should we pay attention to the introduction of the WTO regulations and operational mechanism , rather than remaining at the level of shouting slogans , stirring up news , and analyzing advantages and disadvantages ?  Should we adopt a more rational , pragmatic , and scientific attitude ?  
To put it in concrete terms , first , we will institute a standard modern enterprise system , encouraging large and medium-sized SOEs to practice the joint-stock system , amplify the legal person management structure , and change their operational mechanism through such forms as standardized listing in the stock markets , joint ventures between Chinese and foreign investors , mutual share-holding , and so on . 
Lin Chong-pin stated : Beijing 's Taiwan policy has been obviously integrated with its strategy , and the basic framework of this policy has not changed and remains to be the " one country , two systems " and " peaceful reunification . "  In the tactical aspect , however , Beijing has constantly readjusted the forms of this policy .  Since July 1999 , Beijing has applied four operational tactics toward Taiwan .  
As radical nationalism in itself is just an operational platform for speech , it must be combined with other ism values in order to assume the state of actual political operation .  In terms of contemporary China , the ideology or ism the most capable of functioning well on the platform of nationalism is exactly leftist radicalism ; such a leftist current of thought , revitalized through being combined with radical nationalism , will acquire momentum in terms of " being able to command the local lords in the name of the emperor . "  
After our WTO entry , our agricultural product markets and agricultural key element markets will be tied to the international market , and this will help us learn from others , introduce competitive mechanisms and regulations of the international market , and accelerate a sound and complete market system and operational mechanism for agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  
After our entry into WTO , domestic agricultural markets will certainly come into contact with the international market .  Faced with the unified , large international market which has over one-hundred years of history and which enjoys increasingly sound and healthy systems and operational mechanisms , such short-comings as the split between trade , industry and agriculture , disconnects between production and marketing , and enclosed , excessive and disorderly regional competition in our domestic agricultural market which has been divided by departments and administrative regions will be fully exposed .  
The operational concept of " full dimensional protection " which was proposed by the US military in 1996 calls for the establishment of both offensive and defensive measures to deal with information warfare , guided missiles , and nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons of mass destruction .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
On 16 March , we saw " gunsmoke " rising inside an indoor campaign operation room of a certain group army in the Nanjing Military Region , for a joint operational training exercise was under way there , involving units of various services and arms : Commanding officers at all levels in several units of various services and arms were skillfully directing operations in accordance with a campaign resolve by coordinating and cooperating with one another in tacit agreement and by launching a fatal strike at an " enemy " with a " heavy fist " as well .  
The Chinese Government and people have the right to know why the US sidefrequently dispatched military surveillance planes to China 's coastal waters tocarry out activities , why the US plane violated operational rules and suddenlyveered , bumped into , and destroyed the Chinese plane , and why the US planeintruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed at a Chinese airportwithout permission . 
A combination of operational forces has been accelerated further through the wide use of microelectronic and software technologies with computers at the core , remote and sense technologies dominated by battlefield monitoring and target detection , and military high-tech , such as military engineering , antichemical , and military command and management technologies .  Meanwhile , a new situation of joint operations , with coordination between frontline and rear units , among three armed forces , and between the military and civilians , has taken shape .  
The mechanism for talks between the two associations on the two sides of the strait is presently still the most feasible and workable consultative channel .  The government has not considered changing or adjusting the consultative mechanism for the two associations from the two sides of the strait .  The operational mechanism for the two associations is sufficient for responding to and handling cross-strait issues , and it is still not yet time for changing it .  
An important mission in warfare research is to study new rules for commanding war in light of changes in the form of warfare , with special emphasis on the way operational guidelines and strategic military operations are prepared and executed .  
Thus apart from laying a solid foundation of knowledge , especially by taking a " general course " on directing joint operations in a military academy or school , our commanding officers should also devote more energy to learning and applying knowledge on different services and arms through peacetime campaign training exercises ; should work hard to learn about the basic formations of different services and arms as well as the functional features and operational principles of different types of weapons and equipment ;  
wherever blockades are organized , the area is bound to lose the spirit of fair competition , and the operational environment deteriorates , with the result that genuine investors flinch at the sight , the quality of economic growth declines , and economic vitality is thus weakened , and this is actually having eyes only for the present and forgetting about the long term .  
The " operational manual for new-type aircraft and fighters " compiled by reading several hundreds of new aircraft materials , studying and analyzing over a-hundred pieces of cabin equipment and aerial test flight verifications , and with the efforts of Li Keqiang and pilots of the whole regiment was published , thus providing effective technical support for our military training for refitting new-type fighters .  Following that , six volumes of " collections of theses on study of new-type aircraft tactical and combat methods " were compiled and published .  
As revealed , the new model of antisatellite satellites that Russia 's new space force will be equipped with is two to three metric tons in weight and four to six meters in length and has an operational altitude of 5,000 km .  It can attack reconnaissance , navigational , and meteorological satellites deployed by an enemy in low Earth orbits as well as space planes .  
In ancient times , because the level of social productive forces was low and the technological equipment of armed forces was backward , with a lack of variety in arms and services and relatively simple operational methodology , the main format of operations was uniformly infantry engagement on the ground .  
The difference is that combined operations are dominated by synergy of different arms based on a dominant arm , supplemented by the support among different services , so as to form an overall operational power within the systems of the arms .  They normally serve the purpose of achieving tactical objectives and the operational strength , means of command , and formats of operations are relatively unvaried and the degree of synergy is relatively low .  
Supported by a total of nine regional operational control centers ( ROCC ) , including a temporary center commissioned in Iceland in 1988 , the JSS system has deployed a sensor-surveillance network , comprising a total of 85 radar , including 47 on the US territory , which are capable of monitoring areas 320 kilometers wide on the US territory and in the surrounding areas . 
62 and 71 airborne brigades according to the " armed forces refining program " .  It is slightly different from foreign exclusive special operations units , such as the US Navy SEALs , French GIGN , and British SAS and SBS .  It is a multipurpose special operations unit responsible for various operational tasks , such as defending mountain regions , anti-airborne operations , and coming to the relief of cities , in addition to such offensive operations as special airborne operations .  
At this crucial moment in a new stage of development , state-owned enterprises must calmly cope with the new situation and guard against any blind optimism and intention of relaxation .  They should continue to concentrate on deepening the reform , consolidate what they have achieved in restructuring themselves and lifting themselves out of difficulties , and persist in raising their operational efficiency so as to lay a sound foundation and create a favorable situation for meeting the medium - and long-term targets of their reform and development .  
The ministers reaffirmed the statement of the Brunei Ministerial Conference and Informal Leadership Meeting on launching a new round of multilateral trade talks in 2001 , held that the WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in November in Qatar represents a critical opportunity for the launch of a new round of WTO talks and that it is necessary to accelerate WTO work , speedily formulate a balanced , operational , broad-based agenda for the talks , and expressed particular concern for the interests of developing members .  
Then , aside from assigning the personnel with doctorate or master 's degrees to units with modern equipment and positions that require scientific and technical expertise , the region also gave them important military assignments to accomplish , or assigned them to oversee projects of tackling difficult operational and training problems .  
A joint command will have to concentrate both qualified and capable command personnel and technologically advanced command facilities .  On the basis of guaranteeing efficient operation , a joint command will have to set up fewer vertical command links , and recruit fewer but highly capable personnel , aside from constantly studying new command measures , and raising command efficiency , thus ensuring timely , highly efficient , and acute command , and unleashing overall operational efficiency to the greatest extent , in a key zone , and at a crucial juncture .  
It is necessary to fully explore scientific and technological strengths on the basis of accommodating characteristics of information society and to build the military 's internal network of information on political education and make such a network operational as soon as possible , so as to reduce the number of levels and simplify procedures to ensure that education can keep up on a timely basis , respond rapidly , work effectively , and produce real results .  
We must push forward " four innovations " with persistent efforts , namely , innovating in theories , contents , methods , and systems , and work hard to bring about a breakthrough in our military theories , operational guidance , and basic tactics .  We must energetically press ahead in an all-round way our activities of training troops through science and technology , and popularize and upgrade such activities as well .  In training our troops through science and technology , we must also work hard to translate achievements into fighting capacity .  
The southern Fujian fishing ground is among the Chinese fishing grounds abundant in aquatic products .  It is adjacent to the Zhoushan fishing grounds , the eastern Guangdong fishing grounds , and Taiwan 's shallow water fishing grounds and has an actual operational fishing ground as large as 26,000 sq . km . in area and shoals and surface as large as more than 200 sq . km .  
Officers and soldiers of the detachment had undergone several weeks of training in port and along the coast .  They also had undergone simulated attack training scores of times .  Their training programs included radar searches , transmitting target parameters , preparing for missile attacks , and making command decisions .  Their reaction time has continuously shortened .  The operational skills of relevant personnel have been greatly improved .  All these factors have laid a foundation for the detachment in successfully using missiles to attack mobile target ships that can change speed and direction .  
We should do so by starting with leaders in various financial institutions .  We should uphold healthy trends , develop new practices , enhance institutional initiative and creativity , and carry out to the letter , the decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council . We should make fresh , and greater contributions , through pushing forward a financial reform , rectifying financial order , stepping up financial supervision and control , and heightening operational efficiency , and should guard against and alleviate financial risks , and support national economic development as well .  
So , it is of essential significance for the " Group on Adjustment of the Policy on the Mini Three Links " to establish an office in Kinmen . The DPP Central Executive Committee appointed Chen Chao-nan to take part in the Kinmen election by considering him a suitable candidate owing to his frequent visits to Kinmen to collect public opinion .  The party has its operational mechanism and will make proper arrangements .  
To make a breakthrough in this logistical support at sea , this base has organized missile technology experts and officers and men of battleships and logistical support ships to jointly study various operational measures for overcoming adverse weather conditions and formulated scientific plans on missile replenishment .  
The Gulf War and the Kosovo War have both borne out that since weapons have become more antipersonnel , only with superior operational capacity on the part of combat personnel , who are equipped with appropriate equipment and guided by a correct theory , will a combat unit secure more chances for winning a battle .  
The Genoa meeting discussed many topics , but it mainly discussed global issues including reduction and exemption of poor countries ' debts , environmental protection , resolution and elimination of regional crises , and prevention and treatment of AIDS . However , the only accomplishment of this meeting would be its decision to establish a " global health fund . "  The fund intends to be fully operational within 2001 and aims to deal with AIDS , malaria , and TB , which are the three major contagious diseases threatening mankind .  
The provision for a department to be in charge of a Sino-foreign joint venture was a result of the planned economic system of those days .  After the economic structural reform , government administration have been separated from enterprise management , and administrative organs separated from enterprises .  Under the socialist market economic conditions , in particular , enterprises enjoyed full authority to make their own managerial decisions , and the government mainly carried out macro-direction and is not supposed to intervene in enterprises ' specific production and operational activities .  
Besides , the Corps has also mapped out a series of rules and regulations , renovated and transformed the bulk of its installations , correspondingly erected a number of facilities of a preliminary scale , and introduced a whole set of automatic management systems , thus bringing about a leap forward for operational positions management , from human operations to automated operations .  
After the trials of training in high temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius and frigid cold of 30 degrees Celsius below zero ; after successively moving across Bohai , Donghai , Nanhai , and other sea areas ; after undergoing rigid training and roughing it out , the Navy Marines of our army have now found an operational program that is suitable for moving , eating , living , and fighting in all kinds of weathers and environments under the condition of modern warfare .  They have also mastered the skill of fighting in complicated regions .  
In view of southwest China 's complex terrains , changeable climates , and harsh environments , they have trained a number of " all-weather " contingency units that have strong weaponry support - - through setting up courses that train units for highland operations with long-range weaponry support in the theater under inclement weather conditions .  Meanwhile , they have come up with new operational and training methods that meet the needs of actual operations and the special features of new weaponry .  
Mou went on : In the new century , we 're bound to see a faster flow of goods , services , information , capital , and personnel .  With global economic cooperation constantly renewed and upgraded in terms of content and mode , we 're also bound to witness endless drastic changes in global trade in terms of operational speed , operational mode , and enterprises ' production mode and operative mode as well .  
It is impossible to successfully organize such a colossal and complicated support by relying on the army 's logistic department alone .  The only way to meet the operational needs is to rely on the economic strength of the state as a whole to blend operational logistics support into the " vast logistics " for society to effect an army-civilian integral support .  
The integrated logistics support system is independent organizationally and unitary task-wise .  The joint operational logistic support system alone is responsible for all general-purpose supplies and services and special-purpose supplies and services .  This will effectively remedy the drawback of the existing system in which general-purpose support and special-purpose support are " two separate lines " vertically and " detached " horizontally .  
The existing joint rear service system based on military regions still adopts the past method of combining supply and demand as one and integrating fund and support-in-kind .  This can hardly meet the demand of the " three-dimensional matrix " style operational mechanism of integrated support .  The mechanism for logistical operation must be changed .  
With its great efforts over the past 50 years , the Chinese Navy has initially built a modern marine operational force composed of the crack troops of five branches - - surface warships , submarines , naval air force , coastal guard , and the marines .  The Chinese Navy is capable of carrying out various kinds of operational tasks on coastal waters .  
Reform will continue to take the institution of a modern enterprise system and operational mechanism suited to the requirements for the market economy as a center , so as to quicken the pace of enterprises ' strategic reorganization , speed up the reform of a standardized company system , and develop a coordinated specialized and socialized system .  
The foreign environmental protection enterprises ' natural link with the market economy enables them to gain advanced experiences in operational mechanism , market concepts , innovation awareness , personnel and distribution system , and others which are suited to the market economy .  These are useful experiences that the domestic environmental protection enterprises can use for reference in their development , reform , and transformation of operational mechanism at a faster pace so as to suit the major development trend of the environmental protection markets all over the world .  
However , the absolute quantity of civilian products produced by armament industry enterprises declined rapidly , mainly because of insufficient investment , debt payment failures , competition of foreign goods , unsuccessful privatization , and technological and operational difficulties in changing products .

Thanks to the construction and development over the past half a century , a remarkable improvement has been registered in the overall surveying and mapping level of our army ; and the use of new and high technologies , represented by satellite positioning , remote surveying , digital mapping , and a military geographic information system , has provided a strong surveying and mapping support for the operational commanding of our army .  
China 's banking industry should accelerate its pace of transforming operational mechanisms , bring about banking system upgrading , open up new business spheres , elevate its managerial level in a comprehensive way , open the financial sector wider to the outside world , maintain the state 's financial security , and facilitate the strategic adjustment of the national economic structure and the change of economic growth pattern .  
Deng Xiaoping advanced the theory on the implementation of the open policy in socialist states and took the open policy as a basic national policy on China 's socialist construction .  To gain advantages comparable with that of capitalism , Deng noted , socialism should boldly absorb and use all civilized achievements created by human society , including developed capitalist states ' advanced operational and managerial approaches that reflect the law of modern socialized production .  
The " Publication Control Regulations " and the relevant regulations on newspaper and periodical control lay down that in publishing newspapers and periodicals it is necessary to have a set business scope and a specific operational purpose ; this is the most basic regulation on running papers and periodicals .  
Responsible official of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission stressed today that all party committees , governments , and discipline inspection and supervisory organs should strengthen the supervision over the behaviors of enterprise leading cadres in doing operational and managerial activities , should earnestly implement the relevant regulations on the responsibility system for building party style and administrative honesty , and should resolutely investigate and deal with without any lenient behaviors that have caused tremendous losses to the state due to duty dereliction .  
In the inspection of units producing or operating vehicles and watercraft , special stress must be laid on the areas of vehicle manufacturing and modification , examination and approval of load capacity , on-the-road inspection and banning , in-port inspection and clearance , and loaded watercraft .  We must comprehensively investigate , deal with , and put in order the problems of overloading , overspeeding , and illegal passing of vehicles and resolutely stop the operation of units not conforming to operational safety rules and requirements and may go to the extent of revoking their licenses .  
We have further standardized the operational behaviors of the financial companies and have enhanced supervision or management of the financial companies to ensure their healthy development .  Apart from laying down explicit regulations for supporting their healthy development , the newly promulgated " Management Measures " has also introduced some new regulations aimed at enhancing supervision or management or at guarding against risks in light of our experiences or lessons in supervision and management over the past few years .  
In keeping with the operational state of the national economy , China 's financial expenditures and outlays maintained fairly rapid growth during the first half of the year , with fiscal revenues coming to 624 billion yuan , an increase of 94.6 billion yuan ( or 17.9% ) over the same period last year , while nationwide fiscal outlays came to 583.8 billion yuan , an increase of 119.0 billion yuan ( or 25.6% ) over the same period the previous year . 
Organization and personnel departments at all levels should fully perform their functions of providing macro-level regulation and operational guidance , successfully carry out the work of initiating and coordinating efforts , act in close coordination with personnel planning , fiscal , labor , and social security agencies as well as sectoral agencies in charge of science , education , culture , health , information , and publishing , so as to form a joint force and carry out concerted efforts to successfully complete this work .  
As reflected in various localities , in the past , some enterprises with a fairly great number of retired workers had to assign a person to take charge of issuing pensions every month , and this wasted a lot of human and material resources .  After the implementation of socialized distribution of pensions , the management of retirees will be separated from enterprises ; the burdens of enterprises will be greatly reduced and their operational vitality will be noticeably strengthened .  
According to the initial report made by the investigation team , there were no dubious factors for the explosion .  But the military unit obviously violated the operational rules while transporting outdated explosive articles scheduled to be scrapped .  A mistake led to a military vehicle colliding with a bus , causing heavy casualties .  
With such an operational pattern , we will not only be able to provide peasant households with market information , applied technologies , and management experiences through leading enterprises , but will also be able to find effective solutions to the existing decentralized operation of peasant households , link them up with the general market , bring about a sound integration between production and sales , and speed up the structural adjustment of agriculture .  
At present , we should conscientiously study the knowledge relating to the socialist market economy , transform our concepts on financial and economic work , quicken the pace of building the public finance suited to China 's national conditions , further adjust and optimize the financial revenue-expenditure structure , incrementally reduce investment in the profit-making and operational spheres , vigorously cut down the administrative and institutional spending , push the operational institutions into the market , and concentrate the use of financial resources mainly on the areas of social and public necessities and social security .  
As for Chen Chao-min , the repeated charges are : The case of rape and murder of a young girl at the Operations Command of the Air Force and the case of stolen guns and ammunition at the Taoyuan base , both of which have involved wrong verdicts ; backstage deals for personnel appointments , incompetent leadership , low operational rate for second-generation fighter planes , exodus of pilots , and so on .  
Only as a result of extricating large - and medium-sized state-owned enterprises carrying excessive debt and bogged down in difficulties from these difficulties , integrating reforms for state-owned commercial banks that concentrate on disposal of bad assets , and the State adopting resolute measures for transforming the banks ' partial creditor 's rights in these enterprises into the shareholder 's rights of financial asset management companies will some products be enabled to have a market , prospect for development , advanced technology , a good operational foundation , and a strong leadership team .  
On the afternoon of 22 December , the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] Standing Committee organized its members to join in a group discussion to deliberate a draft Decision on Safeguarding Internet Security . The group held : We should comprehensively regulate the Internet to ensure its operational security and information security , facilitate a healthy development of the Internet , safeguard national security and public interests of the society , and protect the legitimate rights and interests of individuals , legal entities , and other organizations .  
Li Chieh also indicated that , considering the operational management problems on the elongated Taiwan Strait , the numerous missiles deployed on shores , and the limited operational space in the Strait , if the Navy can carry out mobile ocean-going missions from a greater distance , the Navy 's operations would not be confined in the Taiwan Strait and could hinder Communist China 's military deployments and prevent it from mobilizing its full force into operations in the Taiwan Strait .  
The reform of rural credit cooperatives should limit to correcting the direction of persistently serving " three aspects of agriculture " ; and should strive to attain the goal of clearly defining relations between ownership and management , improving and perfecting the structure of management by legal persons , guarding against financial risks , changing the management style , reinforcing internal management , and keeping bad debts and operational losses under strict control .  
By way of conducting all kinds of specialized improvement activities , some outstanding problems in the public security contingent have been resolved , the law-enforcing behavior of the people 's police has been standardized , the image and mental outlook of the contingent have shown rather manifest changes , and its overall quality and operational effectiveness have been greatly enhanced .  
The guiding ideas on the propaganda and ideological front are clear , its line of thought on work is distinct , it is bold in reform and innovation , and effective in macro regulation and control ; it has built relatively perfect regulations and systems and effective operational work mechanisms , and fostered a work force which is politically strong and professionally skilled , with strict discipline and healthy work style .  
Third , we need to reform the agricultural scientific and technological management structure , set up an open , mobile , competitive , and coordinated agricultural scientific and technological operational mechanism , and gradually form a new-type management structure suited to the socialist market economic development .  
- - Comprehensively implementing the strategy of industrializing the agricultural operation , improving the processing and transformation level of agricultural products , and enhancing the extension effect of agriculture .  The province will actively spread new operational forms in its rural areas , such as linking industrial companies with farming households and introducing an orders-based agriculture ;  
The new technological revolution , represented by information technology , biotechnology , and nanometer technology , is now profoundly changing the traditional economic structure , production organization , and operational modes and is bringing about a leap in the quality of the development of productive forces .  
It is imperative to further accelerate structural innovation and perfect the market economic system .  In particular , it is necessary to speed up the development of the modern enterprise system and the market system , introduce management systems and operational rules that conform to international practice , and inject fresh vitality into economic development .  
" We lack a group of leading talented people who are capable of leading and directing in global science and technology , and we lack a large number of high quality operational and managerial talents who are familiar with market economic law . "  
In the vast central and west region , the natural and human resources are abundant , the operational costs are cheap , the domestic markets are huge , and the scientific and technological development and manufacturing industry have also had considerable foundations .  
Once the railway is built and operational , it will : further the economic and social development of Tibet and raise the people 's standard of living ; put Tibet in better economic and cultural contact with its brother provinces , autonomous regions and directly-administered municipalities ; bring the various ethnic groups closer together ;  
Article 11 .

One way , reveals a veterinarian , is that many people whose pets become seriously ill just abandon them at the animal hospital , never returning to pick them up . There is no system in place in Taiwan to take in stray animals . Given operational constraints on a hospital , the only thing a vet can do is to set these unhealthy animals free in the wild . But this turns the problem from being an implicitly contractual one ( between owner and vet ) , or personal moral one , into one foisted on society .  
In order to achieve its new goals , the PRC has been buying or developing ( with the help of hired Russian experts ) SU-27 fighters , inter-continental ballistic missiles , and cruise missiles , and is forming a naval task force capable of independent operational capability . General Tang Fei , chief of the ROC general staff , judges that there are a number of objectives behind the PRC 's transformation of its military strategy .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability .

"  
For example , for the Alishan Mountain Railway , considered one of the three most important mountain railways in the world , it is not enough to explain the chronological and technical processes of its construction . You must also explain its relationship to the entire history of lumbering and its effect on the forest , and conduct surveys of all the stations along the line . And your report has to exhaustively discuss the development of settlements along the way , the current operational status , problems and shortcomings , and the views of local residents .  
However , external criticism focused on how the Ministry of Finance turned the eighth seat over to representation by the Executive Yuan Development Fund . If the shares held by the Executive Yuan Development Fund are sold off under the announced privatization policy , the government will lose its board majority .

The veracity of the information is enhanced to the extent that structured technical and operational relationships are working in close , and timely , collaboration at the national , regional , and international levels ;  
Although statements were made at the rhetorical level , to his knowledge there had never been an operational attempt to give content to economic , social and cultural rights , nor to include them in overall strategies or specific objectives pursued .  
Concerning the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , it was often stated that the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights was too vague to be of operational significance .  
His delegation encouraged the relevant United Nations agencies to contribute to the SystemWide Action Plan , which would be greatly enhanced by agreement on shared goals leading to concrete operational activities at the field level . 
In the field , common sense and sound management practice dictate that the head of mission ensures that national contingent commanders are involved in operational planning and decisionmaking , especially where their respective contingents are concerned .

Based on the agreement concluded between the two organizations , we have indeed developed flexible forms of cooperation , not only in the political area , but in our joint efforts on humanitarian issues , human rights , sanctions-monitoring and operational presence .  
This is why it is imperative that both exercises should result in a final break with regrettable strategies aimed at turning procedural questions and an accrued demand for reform into prerequisites preventing all possibility of substantive debate about the real stakes and about problems affecting the operational capabilities of the United Nations to realize its enormous potential to support economic and social development in developing countries .  
It is equally important to realize that restructuring alone can not accomplish much in the area of socio-economic development without a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries , as called for in resolution 48 / 162 .  
While my delegation is fully committed to participating actively and constructively in future consultations on new modalities for funding for operational activities for development , we believe that what is now crucial is the political will and determination of all parties on how best to arrest the downward spiral of resources for development . 
My delegation pays tribute to the Secretary-General and to the Chairman of the consultation process on prospective new modalities for funding operational activities for development , whose excellent reports offer a comprehensive but also detailed understanding of the question , making it possible to identify the main problems posed by the inevitable , though lengthy and arduous , carrying out this undertaking .  
The Agenda is consistent because , learning from the failure of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 , it was designed as an operational whole in which the respective responsibilities and commitments of Africa and the international community were clearly spelled out in what has rightly been called a partnership contract intended to lay the groundwork for lasting African economic and social recovery before the end of the present decade .  
The preparatory group has identified three main issues that need to be resolved at the Oslo meeting : first , that we need to reach a common understanding of what basic social programmes to include in this context ; secondly , we need to define the modalities for implementing the 20 / 20 principle in operational terms ; and thirdly , we need to agree on ways of monitoring its implementation .  
Without a realistic and sufficiently operational vision for dealing with the basic security and political issues in the region , the OSCE will not be able to play an active role and will react to emerging situations in a random and not necessarily successful manner .  
It is precisely in these areas that both Organizations have accumulated an inspiring operational capacity , expertise and legal basis that , if rationally combined and divided between them , would make it possible to substantially improve work done in the search for effective responses to international challenges .  
The programme covered areas where the secretariat had established operational capacities and addressed such specific areas as export diversification and trade development , customs and trade facilitation , trade statistics , debt management , external financial flows and investments , domestic financial markets , insurance and transport , as well as the regulatory framework affecting those areas and the business environment in general .  
Either of these modalities , together with strong political support for operational activities , could provide a better system with more assured , predictable and increased levels of resources to meet the needs of developing countries .  
United Nations development efforts should be supported by a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as stated in resolution 47 / 199 ;  
These have been actively considered by UNDP within the broad framework of a strategic management initiative aimed at harmonizing three distinct components of UNDP programming : strategic planning - addressing its basic mission and strategies ; operational planning - focusing on means of achieving results ; and results management - analysing , through monitoring , review and evaluation , real performance against stated plans .  
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
At consultations held in 1994 at Bellagio , Italy , and Coppet , Switzerland , on the theme " Refocusing UNEP " , it was concluded that UNEP should reorient its current programme , emphasize strategic and intellectual leadership rather than operational activities and develop the substantive and managerial capacity to catalyse external resources effectively .  
By its decision 16 / 25 of 31 May 1991 , the Governing Council set the following long-term goals for the work of ELI / PAC : ( a ) a coherent body of international law in the environmental field ; ( b ) national environmental laws adopted and institutions established in developing countries ; and ( c ) an operational comprehensive database on national and international environmental law . 
To facilitate their effective implementation , it may be necessary to assemble , with full participation of all concerned entities of the United Nations system , all the pieces in a single , integrated operational framework with clear-cut priorities , time-bound targets in line with those set by the World Summit for Social Development in the most crucial areas , and well-defined responsibilities for national and international efforts .  
In the view of the authors , the significant international financial support anticipated by the Programme of Action has not materialized ; the science and technology policies and programmes of the United Nations system are hardly coordinated around strategic goals ; institutional and programme adjustments are inadequate and a common operational science and technology framework is absent .  
My Government sincerely hopes that the consequent misgivings will come to naught and that the upcoming period , during which the operational aspects of the new arrangement will be defined , will show that the international community stands united in protecting the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a United Nations Member State .  
The broad mandate outlined in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action has sometimes tended to be measured in terms of the number of experts from developing countries working on projects , the frequency of meetings to promote TCDC and the level of procurement from the developing countries , instead of being seen as a rational imperative for ensuring the full integration of TCDC into the wider conception of operational activities in support of the overall development process .  
Based on the fundamental and inexorable shifts that have occurred in the dynamics of global development cooperation , it is important to reorient TCDC in terms of its substantive policy and operational thrust in order to ensure that it continues to serve as a dynamic technical cooperation instrument at the disposal of the developing countries and the international community as a whole .  
In the light of current global realities , it is important and timely to reverse this trend and to renew efforts to ensure that the two concepts become more closely linked at an operational level .  
UNMIH will then gradually expand its presence in each of the operational zones by deploying conventional forces to base camps that will be constructed throughout the country and by actively patrolling from the base camps to ensure that the local governmental , social , and economic institutions can operate unhindered .  
Since 1959 , the scope and importance of space applications have expanded from a narrow field of science and technology to a wide range of applications that are essential to operational communications , weather forecasting , resource management , prevention and mitigation of disaster , environmental monitoring and other social and economic activities in virtually every country .  
The main purpose will be to establish a system of coordination and operation which , within the existing level of institutional management capacity , would lead to better planning and operational management by the United Nations system as a whole , with the result that scarce human and material resources are utilized more appropriately in the provision and coordination of humanitarian assistance in the context of the overall work of the United Nations system .  
The objective of the subprogramme is to support the mechanisms for operational coordination and inter-agency programming through IASC , other forums and the United Nations resident coordinators in the field in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent response to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of persons suffering from famine or displaced by civil strife or other disorders .  
The activities to be carried out in the biennium 1996-1997 under the three subprogrammes of programme 12 of the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised ( A / 47 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , will emphasize assistance to developing countries in improving their development planning systems and policies in support of national development through provision of advisory services to Governments upon their request and substantive and operational support to technical cooperation projects .  
This would include major equipment , large quantities of minor equipment or consumables at or above a threshold value , to be agreed in phase III , destroyed or damaged as a result of hostile action or abandoned at the direction of the Force Commander owing to operational exigencies ( e.g . , emergency evacuations to protect the Force ) .

In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
Moreover , in order to exercise its role in providing policy guidance in operational activities , the Council may wish in the future to request the executive boards of the funds and programmes to address the relevant issues arising from the triennial comprehensive policy reviews on the basis of a common report prepared by the concerned organizations ( see para . 17 below ) .  
Stresses the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
Decides that neither partial funding authority nor the operational reserve mechanism will be restored to UNIFEM until relevant control mechanisms have been thoroughly reviewed and new procedures have been put in place that will ensure , inter alia , the accurate calculation and regular updating of reserve levels , and the establishment of a system to provide sufficient early warning of any possible future drawdowns on the reserve ;  
The operational and administrative procedures that the ministries use to conduct their day-to-day business need to be improved , and there needs to be ( a ) a degree of decentralization of decision-making to qualified managers and technical specialists ; ( b ) a building up of a professional civil service based on merit ; ( c ) an improvement in communication flows within the ministries ; and ( d ) a procedure for record-keeping in order to establish a solid foundation for institutional memory . 
Specific reimbursement rates for environmental and intensified operational use conditions would be recommended by the initial United Nations technical survey team for approval within the mission budget and revised as required by changing circumstances .  
One characteristic of the operational activities of the United Nations system in Djibouti is the sustained and close collaboration of all United Nations agencies present in the country to coordinate their efforts in order to respond to the growing social and economic problem of the refugees .

The Cook Islands suggested that the United Nations convene a meeting of the legal advisers of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of small States to discuss their role , the special operational and logistical problems they faced , inter alia , regarding participation in the multilateral treaty-making process and the fulfilment of reporting obligations , and possible means to resolve such problems through cooperation at the regional and global levels .  
Since sufficient grant resources have not been forthcoming on a voluntary , predictable and assured basis to support operational activities at the level required , consideration needs to be given to a funding system which would place operational activities on a more viable basis .  
Smaller specialized agencies have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with highly focused subsectoral issues and that operational activities should remain flexible to meet requirements in these specific technical areas .  
The United Nations system continues to play an important role in many traditional areas of operational activities in several countries : nearly all developing countries cited technical and technological assistance , social development , poverty alleviation , health and education , and the improvement of human resources as continuing priorities for the United Nations system .  
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;  
In response to the acknowledged need to strengthen the operational capacity of the United Nations programme , UNDP , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies were called upon to support technical cooperation activities devoted to strengthening the rule of law , in cooperation with the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including proper coordination and fund-raising efforts .  
The Council stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , through advisory services and training programmes , field studies and action-oriented research at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels .  
At the same time , operational activities are to be expanded significantly and a solid base for technical cooperation and assistance established , to strengthen the programme 's role as a service provider , as well as an honest broker in putting prospective donors and clients in touch , promoting international exchanges , coordinating regional and interregional action , etc .  
The crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including its network of institutes , could usefully be included in the new combined promotional and operational TCDC activities , and priority undertakings such as the replication of successful innovative projects , development of subject-specific TCDC products , promotion of joint strategies to deal with the problems faced by groups of countries , and mobilization of support , including triangular cooperative arrangements .  
Issues addressed here are closely related to those being considered by the General Assembly at its current session with respect to international cooperation in the eradication of poverty in developing countries , the International Year for Poverty Eradication , the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development , the coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences and the comprehensive policy review of operational activities .  
While there is a need for basic operational reliability , many established and routine forms of communication can be utilized effectively for early warning if there is an official recognition of their utility and organizational planning to do so .  
In areas where UNITAR enjoys a strong comparative advantage , a reinforced General Fund would have a multiplying effect , since the programme officers or managers could dedicate all their time to increasing the scope and range of their programmes , improving methodologies and materials , and raising funds for concrete operational activities .  
States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;  
As a follow-up to the conclusions of the 1995 annual meeting , civic leaders will receive more training in the planning and design of social policies and a framework will be established for exchanges of information between mayors and entrepreneurs , incorporating operational information about investment projects in the participating cities , with a view to facilitating the creation of a market for strategic urban projects in Ibero-America .  
The United Nations system 's operational activities for rehabilitation during the past year have focused on assisting local communities in rural infrastructure , food production , health improvement , animal health services , rehabilitation of disabled people and human settlements .  The main underlying purpose of these activities is poverty alleviation and human development .  
In that connection , activities that could improve the operational use of space technology were the establishment of local receiving stations , increased accessibility to environmental data and the stimulation of data sharing between international , regional and national organizations and agencies .

Recommendation 1 : Wherever United Nations system organizations desire to enhance cooperative relationships with the multilateral financial institutions , their executive heads and the governing bodies responsible for operational activities for development should make a meaningful commitment to increase the competitiveness of their programmes .  
The United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , which was the core of the system of operational activities , had provided assistance in such crucial areas as national capacity-building in management , governance and democratization , private sector development and economic reforms , human resources , the social sector and the development of environmentally sound energy sources .  
Jamaica , therefore , supported recommendation 6 of the Secretary-General 's report ( A / 50 / 202 ) which called for the re-energizing of negotiations on a new , improved funding system in accordance with resolution 48 / 162 , which had called for a substantial increase in funding required for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis . 
In the interests of increased savings and the successful implementation of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and given the fact that the outcome thus far had fallen short of expectations , his delegation attached great importance to the ongoing efforts of resident coordinators to ensure closer involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions in operational activities , in particular at the field level . 
the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 ;  
Stresses the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] in particular of the attention paid by the Secretary-General to effectiveness , accountability and transparency in humanitarian assistance under increasingly complex operational environments and the need for further efforts to identify and support the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , Taking note of the establishment , within the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , of Reliefweb , for the dissemination of reliable and timely information on natural disasters and other emergencies ,  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Calls upon developing , developed and other countries , their intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as well as the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , to give their full support to the effective implementation of the technical cooperation among developing countries framework , including support for innovative national , regional and interregional programmes and projects and the expanded utilization of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality in the operational activities for development of the United Nations system ;  
On the basis of the cooperation agreement signed in 1976 between the two intergovernmental institutions , and strengthened in 1990 by an additional protocol creating a joint consultative commission , joint operational activities are regularly carried out by UNESCO and the Agency in the areas of basic education , education for adults , and after-school education the very foundations of an economic and social development that truly takes into account the human dimension of progress .  
Countries with limited mineral resources , like Armenia , will continue to view the International Atomic Energy Agency as the central medium for the safeguarded transfer of nuclear technology , operational expertise , and technical assistance to countries which explicitly adhere to international non-proliferation objectives and comply with the existing regulations .  
As Japan has long advocated that the Department of Humanitarian Affairs remain faithful to its function as a strategic centre for coordination and that it refrain from becoming involved in the operational field of humanitarian activities , it welcomes such an orientation , and is confident that , with its new and streamlined functions , the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator , together with the strengthened Inter-Agency Standing Committee ( IASC ) , will contribute to an effective response to humanitarian crises .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The four specific action areas laid out in the mission statement - operational assistance , advancement of understanding of the issues , encouragement of social and economic development through migration , and upholding the human dignity and well-being of migrants - permeate the Programme of Action , too , and provide a solid basis for IOM 's institutional commitment to moving the international consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development towards concrete action .  
An international collaborative research initiative , PLEC is based on a comparative network of locally based research clusters ; five are now operational in West Africa , East Africa , Montane Mainland South-East Asia , Papua New Guinea and Amazonia , and a sixth is being developed in the Caribbean region .  
Reporting to the Senior Demobilization Officer the incumbent would ( a ) coordinate field operations , including direction of their day-to-day operations ; ( b ) supervise regional demobilization officers and health and child soldier coordinators ; ( c ) manage and ensure timely availability and delivery of resources to demobilization sites ; ( d ) ensure that demobilization centres operate according to standard operational procedures ; and ( e ) participate in planning and policy development and catalyse efficient use of resources in the field . a Contribution for humanitarian assistance only .  
Recalling further that the International Organization for Migration assists in meeting the operational challenges of migration and that it is committed to the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society , advancing understanding of migration issues , encouraging social and economic development through migration and to working towards effective respect of the human dignity and well-being of migrants ,  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
In order to assist countries in need and to render more operational its technical assistance activities , the Division , as requested by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1996 / 27 , will also develop a training manual for specialized law enforcement and investigative personnel on action against organized transnational crime .  
Recommendations to address these constraints included : ( a ) identifying promotional messages for SHD to be used by all staff in contacts with the media at seminars and other venues ; ( b ) improving links between the staff working in policy , substantive and operational matters and those in media ; ( c ) encouraging all staff to invest time in developing and communicating clear messages on the role and activities of UNDP ; and ( d ) allocating increased funding from the organizational budget for communication and advocacy efforts .  
In all UNDP operational oversight bodies , increasing attention is being paid to the clarity of programme objectives , the extent to which lessons learned have been incorporated into substantive programme design , and the inclusion of adequate performance indicators and managerial arrangements for monitoring and evaluation .  
That resolution reaffirmed the priority of the Programme ( para . 3 ) , requested the Secretary-General to strengthen it further by providing it with the resources necessary for the full implementation of its mandate ( para . 6 ) , called upon States and United Nations and other international , regional and national funding agencies to make significant financial contributions for operational activities of the Programme , and encouraged all States to make voluntary contributions for that purpose to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund .  
First of all , in the view of ACC members , the report does not take sufficient account of the broad variety of NGOs , whose roles , operational procedures and financial requirements are quite different , ranging from large international organizations to national support NGOs and representative peoples ' organizations .  
The general thrust of this recommendation , namely , the need for more active involvement of national NGOs in the country 's economic and social development , is strongly supported by ACC members , since all the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , especially those with operational activities , are well aware of all the benefits of NGO contributions to building equitable and stable societies . 
Accordingly , it is proposed that the budget should include both an annual provision for the normal operational costs of the library and provision to meet the start-up costs of the library , that is , funds for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treatises , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate . 
An important dimension implicit in regional and subregional operational activities , that of the practice and potential for technical cooperation among developing countries , needs to be made more explicit so that more opportunities for such cooperation can be exploited .  
Reaffirming that the initiative on the pilot management scheme presented by the ECLAC secretariat is aimed at strengthening the role of the organization as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ,  
In the absence of a purposeful government programme of national reconciliation and effective police security throughout Croatia , UNHCR and UNTAES agree that all potential returnees should be encouraged to use the operational procedures to be assured of their full rights to reconstruction assistance , social benefits and security .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The General Assembly is encouraged to direct all of its committees and bodies and draw the attention of other bodies of the United Nations system to the need to mainstream a gender perspective systematically into all areas of their work , in particular in areas such as macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters ( para .  12 ) .  
The ability of the United Nations to react in a timely , efficient and effective manner , often at short notice , underpins the need for an integrated operational concept from which subsequent strategies can be developed and implemented .  
It should be noted that the aforementioned resources are in addition to very considerable contributions from third-party sources for UNDP country programmes , in particular from the Governments of Sweden and Norway ; contributions from those two States have been decisive for United Nations actions in support of peace processes and the consolidation of democracy in Central America and have included direct contributions for improving the analytical and operational capacities of UNDP country offices in Nicaragua , El Salvador , Guatemala and , recently , Honduras . 
All three of these operational programmes are supporting the development of environmentally sound , renewable sources of commercial energy with demonstrated viability and the improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
In view of the fact that conditions for its entry into force are not subject to revision , we have to consider seriously a set of measures to provide for the timely implementation of the Treaty , since it is not impossible that a technologically perfect , though expensive , CTBT verification system will be established and ready to function while the Treaty itself is still not operational .  
The inter-agency consolidated appeals will reflect to a greater extent all operational activities performed by humanitarian agencies in specific situations and activities included in appeals will , pursuant to joint consultations , be listed in accordance with the priorities given .  
He welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the operational framework for the International Year ( A / 52 / 328 ) , paragraph 43 of which stressed that the promotion of active ageing in developing countries needed technical and financial international support .  
Welcomes Commission on Narcotic Drugs resolution 6 ( XL ) of 25 March 1997 concerning the revised budget for the biennium 1996-1997 and the proposed outline for the biennium 1998-1999 of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , and urges all Governments to provide the fullest possible financial and political support to the organization by widening the donor base of the Programme and increasing voluntary contributions , in particular general-purpose contributions , to enable it to continue , expand and strengthen its operational and technical cooperation activities ;  
These national services , working collaboratively in real time , provide the unique operational capabilities of the World Weather Watch of the World Meteorological Organisation ( WMO ) , a coordinated international system of national meteorological and hydrological services that is based on the common acceptance of protocols and standard terminology .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
In an indicative list , the Council identified macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters as areas where gender mainstreaming needs to be pursued systematically .  
During the same period , in 1994 , additional work and project changes were requested by ECA , which , inter alia , included electrical , mechanical and special system requirements such as additional and uninterruptible power supply , building automated control system and anti-intrusion security .  Some of these changes were the result of modified user requirements , or for greater operational efficiency , and to take advantage of changes in technology since the original design was drawn , for example innovations in fibre optics .  
Recognizes that the White Helmets , as an operational partner of the United Nations Volunteers , are an efficient and viable mechanism for making pre-identified and trained homogenous teams available to the United Nations system , in support of immediate relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development activities , in the light of the increasing number and growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies ;  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
Urges the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , and invites other relevant intergovernmental organizations involved in international development cooperation , to make concerted and vigorous efforts to mainstream the implementation of modalities of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries by giving them full consideration in the design , formulation , implementation and evaluation of programmes and projects in their operational activities ;  
To that end , the Government is strongly encouraged to consider taking appropriate steps to develop a legal and institutional framework for public broadcasting to ensure that the State-financed broadcasting media can operate effectively as a public service broadcaster , with full guarantees of editorial and operational independence from Government and all other political influence on programming content .  
Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
While acknowledging that the various working groups within the Organization were dealing with individual aspects of this problem , the sponsor noted that they were doing so in a context and manner which were primarily political and operational in nature , whereas the Special Committee , being a body with highly qualified legal expertise , was best suited for dealing with the mere legal aspects of the matter , which were the subject of the proposed declaration .  
The total for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997 was 7,793.14 The Committee was informed that this total included posts for support services and substantive activities ( including posts financed from operational funds posted at established United Nations offices and posts financed from the support account for peacekeeping operations ) .  
The Centre established a comprehensive data base on non-governmental organizations and other partners active in human settlements and is expanding its programme with those partners which had participated actively in the Habitat II preparatory process and had organized their own forums and presented their declarations and commitments to Committee II of the Conference . 11 .  At the present time , the main operational activity of the Centre in relation to the Global Strategy for Shelter , is the application of the urban and housing indicators .  
The present stage requires that we make effective use of every achievement by guiding United Nations action in an innovative and practical direction , based on operational legal aspects of multilateral activities against terrorism .  
In order to put an end to this distressing situation , Africa 's development partners should envisage a comprehensive and integrated mechanism for flexible , operational and effective financing , free of bureaucratic impediments and red tape , with the aim of establishing a centralized funding entity to receive resources from all sources to be devoted to economic and social development .  
The elements of the ANAD peacekeeping force would be coordinated in predetermined tactical or logistical modules in a state of operational readiness on their respective territories and could be sent into action at short notice .  
The Organization 's unrivalled role in the field of development , whether analytical , normative or operational , and in contributing to the creation of a favourable international milieu for development , hardly needs to be emphasized .  
Declares , therefore , that ECLAC should function as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ;  
In the law enforcement sector , UNDCP supported operational and investigative training , providing selected equipment to law enforcement agencies and assisting in establishing and improving the functioning of national drug control coordinating bodies , particularly in Brazil , Cuba and Ecuador and in other countries in Central America and the Caribbean .  
Generally , small island developing States face inordinate operational difficulties because of inadequate technically qualified human resources , poor infrastructure and installation , and deficient planning .  
It also runs specific projects related to : the use of infrared imagery for public agencies , academic and other research institutions ; thermal loss in urban areas ; and the use of NOAA satellite images for the operational definition of cloud systems .  
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 63 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and stressed the need to continue to improve the operational activities of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States , at their request , for support in crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Further , despite pressure from staff in the Office of the Prosecutor and from both Prosecutors to provide day-to-day operational leadership as the senior officer , the Deputy Prosecutor did not assume the role : the Office continued to operate without sufficient staff and other resources ; without sufficient staff prosecutors who possessed enough relevant legal experience to direct the investigations and to prepare and conduct the trials ; and without critical day-to-day operational guidance . 
In addition to being flexible , any new system of desirable ranges should meet a number of operational requirements ; such a system , inter alia , should produce predictable and verifiable results , be easy to administer and be transparent .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls upon members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine , as a matter of priority , options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
The technology involved in the processing and interpretation of digital satellite information and data obtained on the ground for the purposes of evaluation of crop condition and yield \ x { e8ca } echnology which is applied in an experimental operational system ( in a real-time regime ) \ x { e8c3 } akes it possible during the vegetation growing period to make a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the state of crops in 25 regions of the Russian Federation .  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area , and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
These efforts towards reorganization reflect the common understanding that in order to provide objective , impartial and candid assessments , the audit unit has to be granted an adequate measure of operational independence from the entities subject to its scrutiny .  
This could be achieved through a summary report which would be compiled and coordinated by the Office of Internal Oversight Services and submitted to the General Assembly in accordance with paragraph 5 ( e ) ( ii ) of resolution 48 / 218 B . The report would be based on submissions from the operational funds and programmes which would be forwarded to the Office by their executive heads after discussion and approval , as appropriate , by the respective governing bodies . 
However , it is something that the Commission on Human Rights must not overlook and it has to be solved on the basis of more in _ depth knowledge of the facts , specific references and a systematic analysis concluding with suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational standards relating to mercenary activities and to companies which sell security internationally . 
As indicated in the report on follow-up to the decisions taken by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1996 , CCPOQ , with considerable substantive and financial assistance from UNDP , published an operational activities reference manual , which has now been forwarded to all country offices and will serve as a unifying framework within which each agency will operate using its own detailed operational procedures .  
Upon inquiry , the Committee was also informed that constant use related to operational activities of the Force , coupled with the extensive distances over rough mountainous roads , have resulted in vehicles registering well above the standard replacement criteria - these being 5 years or 120,000 km for civilian-pattern vehicles , jeeps , light trucks and minibuses ; 8 years or 135,000 km for ambulances , medium or heavy buses , and trucks up to 4 tons ; 10 years or 250,000 km for heavy buses and trucks , and truck tractors over 4 tons .  
While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
In the inter-agency follow-up to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 56 of 28 July 1995 , agencies agreed that a lead agency might be designated to carry out the functions of operational coordination for a specific target group , geographical area or technical sector ; and that the lead agency would be accountable to the resident / humanitarian coordinator . 
United Nations observations conducted in 87 schools and a detailed infrastructure survey by UNICEF in mid-1997 of an additional 150 schools showed a severe shortage of desks , resulting in an average of four pupils sharing a desk for two and approximately 50 per cent of the students sitting on the floor , lack of teaching aids , buildings in dilapidated condition and a lack of operational water and sanitation facilities .  
In view of Egypt 's perception of the important and vital role of the United Nations and the significance of its operational activities in bringing stability and providing support for national institutions that operate in the developing countries in the sphere of national reconciliation , we stress here the relevance of supporting the efforts of President Preval to overcome the political crisis facing Haiti , and that attainment of final resolutions of the main areas of dispute among the political actors , namely , elections , economic reform and the appointment of a new Prime Minister .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries ;  
While continuing to expand and strengthen its existing web of bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties with other States , Canada also supported the effective implementation by Member States of the measures contained in international legal instruments , as well as the useful practical and operational measures recommended at various international forums .  
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on the operational requirements that necessitated the increase in troops over the authorized level and was informed that the average troop strength exceeded authorized strength by 166 in May 1996 and by 132 in June 1996 owing to the fact that the repatriation of the former UNCRO engineering battalion had to be postponed to the end of June 1996 , since engineering support was needed to complete the installation of military camps . 
The activities will also aim at ( a ) providing the United Nations , the international relief community and potential recipient countries with an operational tool giving access to the exact , reliable and up-to-date data on the existing disaster management capacities that can be called upon at short notice in case of emergency ; and ( b ) creating conditions for the United Nations system and the international community as a whole by facilitating their access to the required emergency humanitarian aid and its expeditious delivery to the disaster-affected population .  
It concluded that the resource targets , including existing operational practices and levels of financing and operational and administrative costs , were not based on quantifiable needs of recipient countries , and that there were no workable methods available at the global level .  
Further , in paragraph 5 of the same resolution , it strongly reaffirmed that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
Four projects on formulation of technical assistance projects that can enhance economic cooperation among developing countries through the exchange of experiences and know-how and the sharing of methods of production , identification of technical assistance needs by integration groupings in the field and searches for practical and operational solutions , development of a cadre of trained negotiators in international commercial diplomacy and mobilization of funds for the financing of operational activities ; 
While there is no commonly accepted definition of what good governance , or " capable " government , means in operational terms , at the very least it signifies the existence of a stable and relatively open and transparent political framework that is representative of , and responsive to , the will of the people .  
Although no concerted move has yet been made by the system to set up the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline data necessary for a comprehensive impact evaluation of operational activities , there have been extensive efforts within JCGP to prepare a common country assessment that , once established , could provide basic data against which progress could be measured .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
As indicated in the report on follow-up to the decisions taken by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1996 , CCPOQ , with considerable substantive and financial assistance from UNDP , published an operational activities reference manual , which has now been forwarded to all country offices and will serve as a unifying framework within which each agency will operate using its own detailed operational procedures .  
They included publication and dissemination of notices of stolen cultural property based on the information received from the national central bureaus of the States members of Interpol , the organization of meetings for police officers and the development of a new international database on stolen cultural objects which , he said , would be operational by the end of 1996 . 
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
The Fund has maintained a solid financial standing and has been utilized by operational organizations of the United Nations system on 48 occasions to meet urgent relief requirements .  
Gravely concerned that the persistent insufficiency and decline of resources for operational activities for development , in particular of core resources , is seriously affecting the priorities and the capacity of the United Nations funds and programmes to carry out their functions and to respond effectively to the increasing needs of all developing countries , as well as seriously eroding their fundamental mandates and characteristics , particularly their universal and multilateral character ,  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
Reaffirms that the objective of capacity-building and its sustainability should continue to be an essential part of the operational activities of the United Nations system at the country level and should be country-driven and situation specific , and should be based on the programme approach , to the extent possible , consistent with national development plans and priorities ;  
At the operational level , the United Nations Special Commission has continued its tasks of verifying the destruction of Iraq 's proscribed weapons and capabilities and of operating a system of ongoing monitoring of its compliance with its obligation not to acquire such weapons or capabilities in the future ( see S / 1997 / 301 , annex ) .  
As a sign of Sweden 's continuing commitment to the work of the United Nations in the economic and social fields , the Swedish Government in its budget bill to the Parliament for 1997 - in spite of cuts in almost all other areas of government expenditure - was proposing a maintained total level of voluntary contributions to the Organization 's operational activities .  
These mechanisms consist , among others , of annual financial reports , semi-annual reports , quarterly reports , audited reports by internal and external auditors , field visits by agency personnel , regular monitoring by geographical desks , narrative reports on progress , regular operational reporting and meetings , as well as mid-term and final reports on activities and finance ( see table 6 below ) . 
In order to be operational , however , such a global model should comprise large-scale national models that should be designed to cover domestic economy , external sector and supply-side response to external shocks such as coercive economic measures .  
The existence within the programme of both normative functions ( funded by the regular budget ) and operational technical cooperation activities ( funded by the Fund of UNDCP ) permits a synergy of action : technical expertise that supports the normative work provides a valuable underpinning for technical cooperation activities , and operational activities provide an important source of experience in putting international norms into practice .  10 .  In its resolution 14 ( XXXVIII ) , the Commission requested the Executive Director to indicate the relationship between mandates and budgetary allocations .  
IPA will be promoted through various means : first , by ensuring that inter-ministerial national drug-control commissions are fully involved in operational activities , thus strengthening their coordination and planning functions ; secondly , by promoting planning and operational linkages with Governments , agencies in the United Nations system , international financial institutions , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations through the incorporation of the drug dimension into mainstream socio-economic development programmes ; and thirdly , by fostering broader social awareness of the deleterious political , social and economic consequences of drug abuse and the illicit drug industry .  
Equally important to both recipients and donors are the knowledge derived by UNDCP from its functions in the field of international treaty implementation and related advisory services , the capacity to adapt to local circumstances a wide range and variety of methodologies and best practices developed under pilot projects throughout the world , and its experience in working with counterparts in defining , planning and implementing operational activities at national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
Finally , for module four , covering demand reduction , the following areas will be of main interest : establishment of a subregional coordination mechanism at policy and operational levels ; harmonization of legislation ; promotion of information exchange at the subregional level ; assessment of illicit demand and sharing of experience in prevention and treatment ; joint training activities ; and harmonization of licit control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors .  
Finally , at the regional level , joint training in investigation techniques ( profiling , search methods , controlled deliveries etc . ) will be organized , and a framework for periodic consultations on operational issues ( trends , concealment methods etc . ) will be set up .  
Specifically , operational activities at national , subregional and regional levels addressed : preventive education for high risk groups ( school children , street children ) ; prevention for intravenous drug abusers to contain the spread of HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases ; implementation of common standards for epidemiological monitoring and systems of information on drug abuse ; prevention of drug abuse in the workplace ; and training for rehabilitation and integration of former drug addicts into society , involving health and education authorities .  
The activities of UNDCP in supply reduction and law enforcement should mean that by the end of the biennium 1998-1999 , closer working links will have been established with Interpol , WCO and Europol ; a global programme on law enforcement measures relating to precursor control will be operational ; a clearer understanding of effective methods of alternative development and monitoring of illicit crops will have been gained ; and high quality , timely analytical data relating to seizures of illicit drugs will be available to Member States and to other organizations .  
Objective : to extend the knowledge base for understanding the international drug problem so that Member States can make more informed policy choices , and so that UNDCP can be more proactive in identifying changes and forecasting trends , and can strengthen its position as a centre of expertise , all of which would contribute to helping fulfill the complementary normative and operational functions of UNDCP .  
Weather forecasts based on numerical weather prediction utilize , among other things , operational satellite measurements of both surface and upper air winds and atmospheric temperature fields ;  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
The review concluded that the UNOPS operational reserve , initially established at a level equal to 20 per cent of the annual administrative budget , was insufficient to match the risks to which UNOPS is exposed as a self-financing operational entity .  
Peacekeeping operations with a humanitarian component were increasingly coming to the fore , and raised a number of difficult political , legal and operational problems .  
Strongly reaffirming the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ,  
In the ensuing discussion , delegations focused on the following key issues : the biennial support budget ; the level of the operational reserve ; funds from private foundations ; the national execution modality ; and unpaid contributions .  
The FAO assessment will be forward looking , and will be carried out in the light of the basic principles and operational guidelines published by FAO in 1996 , as well as the specific elements to be considered during the development and implementation of national forest programmes , as endorsed by IPF ( see E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) .  
Follow-up action has focused on the preparation of teaching materials and the translation of the United Nations standards on criminal justice in the national language for law enforcement officials , examining current penal and banking legislation and creating an effective implementing mechanism , strengthening analytical and operational capabilities , improving inter-ministerial cooperation and enhancing international mutual assistance . 
By contrast , the responsibility of RDMHQ would be to convert the concept and operational plans into usable theatre - and tactical-level plans and operational orders ; to prepare associated standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) ; and to act as an advance headquarters within a mission area during the initial months when swift deployment may be crucial to long-term success .  
The steps already taken by the executive boards of United Nations funds and programmes should be built upon to arrest and reverse the decline in core resources and enhance the effectiveness of operational activities in various ways , including a substantial increase in their funding that would commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  If the current deplorable situation was allowed to continue , there would be a drastic reduction in United Nations operational activities .  
Strongly reaffirms that the impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and the parts relevant to operational activities for development of resolution 52 / 12 B ;  
Such assessments require a political grasp of the clash of parties , values and interests in the mission area , as well as a solid military , logistical and administrative understanding of the risks , costs and means required for operational effectiveness .  
The Department acts as the operational arm of the Secretary-General for United Nations peacekeeping operations and has primary responsibility for managing , directing and supporting all mandated peacekeeping operations and for providing administrative and logistics support to good offices , preventive diplomacy , peacemaking and humanitarian missions , as required .  
In order to achieve the goals agreed by both developing and developed countries at the United Nations global conferences , it was necessary to establish an integrated set of indicators against which progress could be evaluated at the policy and operational levels in such areas as poverty , gender equality , environmental sustainability and access to primary health care and primary education .  
The Seventh Meeting of States Parties in 1997 approved in principle the ongoing need during the first five years to appropriate a sum of $ 60,000 per year to meet the operational costs and $ 60,000 per year for the " start-up costs " of the library , i.e . , resources for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treaties , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate .  
While other agencies had long faced problems in choosing legitimate or representative partners in the private sector , those partners were usually non-profit bodies , whereas working on operational projects with profit-seeking partners was clearly more problematic ; association with the United Nations could be interpreted as giving an unfair commercial advantage over its competitors , national and international . 
By the Governments decision , the National Council for Womens Affairs , headed by a Cabinet member , the Minister for Health and Social Welfare , was established at the end of 1996 , and its operational by-laws were accordingly adopted . the Council is made up of MPs , officials of ministries concerned , representatives of womens non-governmental organizations , voluntary movements , mass organizations , owners of private companies , business and cooperative entities . 
On the basis of the current formula , the operational reserve was set at the level of $ 200-million in 1997 and would be calculated for the biennium 1998-1999 at the level of $ 180-million , based on the resource projection presented to the Executive Board in the annual review of the financial situation , 1997 ( DP / 1998 / 29 ) .  
The objectives of these conferences were to improve the scientific understanding of and the ability to predict the environmental and societal impacts of the phenomena , and to define improved operational and institutional approaches to reducing damage from future occurrences .  
At a meeting with me , on 11 December 1998 , an ECOWAS ministerial delegation on the Guinea-Bissau issues reiterated that ECOWAS needed logistical and financial support in order to proceed with the speedy deployment of the ECOMOG interposition force , the key operational support instrument for the implementation of the Agreement on the ground .  The delegation emphasized the importance of United Nations / ECOWAS collaboration and asked me to appoint a representative in that country .  
Therefore the primary focus of operational activities must continue to be at the country level , with national Governments assuming the main responsibility for coordinating development assistance programming , which , in turn , must be based on the national development plans and priorities of those countries .  
Since the most recent triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , coordination had greatly improved , the resident coordinator system had been strengthened and cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions in such areas as humanitarian assistance , post-conflict peace-building and regional-level operations had increased .  
The General Assembly should take a position on the future pledging mechanism , either in a separate resolution or as part of its general decision on the triennial policy review ; Ukraine supported the establishment of such a mechanism provided that the universal , voluntary and grant nature of United Nations operational activities was maintained .  
Given the limited staffing capacity of the Service , its operations are more reactive than proactive : a greater focus on Headquarters strategic planning and staff resource management would lead to improved service delivery and increased effectiveness in meeting operational and administrative needs in the field .  
The most noteworthy aspect of the results of the survey ( March 1999 ) is that , despite progress in operational terms , which resulted in a near doubling of the maximum penetration achieved in the previous survey , the geological substratum sought in certain critical areas in the central part of the strait has still not been detected .  
Although complex politico-military developments in Angola during the period under review have placed additional strain on the material and human assets of the Observer Mission , resources provided by the General Assembly for this period proved to be adequate to meet MONUAs operational requirements .  
As indicated in paragraph 73 , as well as in table 3 , of the report of the Secretary-General , it is anticipated that , when the proposed enhanced system becomes operational , total biennial communications expenditures of the United Nations under the regular budget would amount to $ 12.5-million-4 / as compared to $ 16.1-million , and that , in respect of peace-keeping operations , current biennial expenditures for communications , which amount to $ 22.8-million , would be reduced to $ 7.2-million .  
The Commission focuses its analytical work on designing public policies and facilitates the implementation of such policies , concentrating operational services in the areas of specialized information , advisory assistance , training and support for regional and international cooperation .  
During the biennium 20002001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will focus on further promoting and coordinating the development of a common principled policy on humanitarian issues and on improving the management and practice of operational and strategic coordination through the development of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned and accountability reviews .  
Pursuant to resolution 1201 ( 1998 ) , by which the Security Council mandated MINURCA to support the conduct of legislative elections in the Central African Republic in November and December 1998 , operational plans developed by MINURCA called for the deployment for a period of 2.5 months of an additional 21 international and 18 local staff , 94 medium and short-term electoral observers and for the provision of related additional air , transportation and communications assets .  
For operational reasons , in view of a substantial quantity of military-pattern equipment provided to the MINURCA military contingents by the Government of France as a voluntary contribution in kind , increased provisions are also made for the supply under letter-of-assist arrangements of essential required spare parts and other matriel required to maintain those assets .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that in view of the continuing operational requirements of the Mission with regard to engineering and logistical support of its activities , in particular the maintenance of the three mission-owned base camps and the logistics complex in Laayoune , it was considered necessary to retain the Engineering and Logistics Sections in the organizational structure of the Mission , headed by Professional staff at the P-4 and P-3 levels , respectively .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 4,571,900 gross ( $ 4,275,100 net ) resulted from reduced requirements as follows : military personnel costs ( $ 83,000 ) , civilian personnel costs ( $ 4,368,400 ) , operational costs ( $ 2,247,300 ) and staff assessment ( $ 296,800 ) ; these were offset by additional requirements amounting to $ 2,423,600 as follows : other programmes ( $ 19,300 ) and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ( $ 2,404,300 ) ( A / 53 / 908 , annex II ) .  
Global programmes of action do provide overall blueprints for the activities in the various field of development initiatives , but they still need to be translated into a coordinated and integrated set of national normatives to be made operational at the country level ( for more detailed information on progress made towards an integrated and coordinated follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , see E / 1999 / 59 ) .  
The analysis conducted by the General Assembly for the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system in 1998 confirmed that resident coordinators have an important role to play in assisting Governments in their responsibilities for the integrated implementation of the major international conferences .  
Within this context , in addition to the delivery of its regular programme of work , the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) assisted the region in facing the consequences derived from those two sets of events , through a mix of normative activities in the comprehensive analysis of development and public policy - making , and operational activities in the form of technical assistance , specialized information and training .  
Subsequently , the General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 192 , paragraph 41 , stressed the growing need for incorporating the regional and subregional dimension in United Nations operational activities for development , and encouraged resident coordinators , in close consultation with Governments , to secure greater involvement of the regional commissions , taking into account their agreed mandates and work programmes , in UNDAF , as appropriate .  
While the distinction was considered of some use in the interpretation of primary rules in an explanatory , didactic sense , doubts were expressed as to whether it should be included in a codification of the law of State responsibility , and if so , whether it could be made operational at the level of secondary rules .  
This programme aims at defining , developing and implementing a dedicated operational end-to-end satellite remote sensing capacity to provide real-time access to appropriate spatial data for supporting sustainable forest management at the subnational level .  
Nevertheless the Mission should have properly documented the conditions surrounding the acceptance of a fleet of buses that fulfilled the operational requirement but that did not meet the original technical specification , albeit to a much lesser extent than originally reported .  
Plans of action have been established at country operational level , focussing on key areas requiring protection and assistance measures ; sexual exploitation and violence ; under-age military recruitment ; education ; and unaccompanied minors and adolescents ; all of which are fundamental to addressing the needs of girls more effectively .  
The present document is submitted pursuant to Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 , in which the Board requested the Executive Director to report biennially on the appropriateness of the level of the operational reserve of the United Nations Office of Project Services ( UNOPS ) , established in the same decision at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year .  
While sharing the concern expressed by some delegations at the third annual sessions 1997 and 1998 that the 4 per cent level of the reserve may be too low , the Executive Director has concluded that the first priority for UNOPS in the current and next bienniums is the restoration of the operational reserve to its level as presently prescribed .  
If that were so , there would be no need to regulate the functioning of unilateral acts , which were to be understood as autonomous or independent acts with their own distinctive characteristics and were to be distinguished from unilateral acts which fell within the scope of treaties and for which specific operational rules could be formulated .  
Reaffirms that untied core resources are the bedrock of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and , in this context , calls on Governments to take steps to address the urgent and immediate need for a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , reflecting the increasing needs of developing countries , taking into account the development of multi-year funding frameworks ;  
Takes note of the efforts already made to strengthen field-level coordination and the role of the resident coordinator system , and encourages further steps towards greater collaboration , at the field level , by ensuring well _ functioning , highly participatory and active country teams , and full consultation with the Governments concerned , while respecting the specific identities and mandates of United Nations operational activities ;  
The positive impulses for pursuing cross-cutting issues of universal character , such as natural disaster reduction , created on the one hand by a division of labour between non-operational responsibilities for system-wide policy development , advocacy and coordination , and on the other hand , by distinct operational responsibilities for all relevant mandate bearers inside and outside the United Nations , in particular in the field of development .  
It is also considered crucial that the next generation of operational observing systems be designed specifically to meet the more stringent requirements imposed by the need for the detection of climate and global change .  
The common set of rules for ensuring the effective and enhanced operational security of global networks is voluntary owing to the fact that countries have not adopted uniform legislation concerning the operation of information networks .  
In view of the low level of voluntary contributions , the small proportion of the regular budget allocated to technical cooperation , and a fluctuating and inadequate operational budget , additional resources were urgently needed .  
The increasing number of complex emergencies and the involvement of the United Nations in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations have raised the interest not only of the traditional operational partners of the United Nations and non-governmental organizations , but also of research and academic institutions and universities .  This development deserves to be encouraged and fortified .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of the report ( DP / 1999 / 40 ) and the interim financial statements for the year ended 31 December 1998 that UNOPS brought the level of its operational reserve from $ 17.6-million at 31 December 1997 to $ 19.9-million at 31 December 1998 , which is the approved level of 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the prior year ( $ 499.7-million ) in accordance with Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 .  
The progressive narrowing of existing gaps between operational measures and corresponding enabling legislation and institutional frameworks is also being addressed through pilot border-management programmes that target the operational strengthening of immigration control as a practical means of bridging these gaps .  
To achieve greater coherence in global economic policy-making , which is one of the functions of WTO , and make it more operational , WTO rules and disciplines should be taken fully into account by the international financial institutions when designing macroeconomic programmes and rescue packages for individual countries .  
Regional economic and social commissions should become better skilled at developing non-governmental organization relations at the regional and national levels , with a view to constructing policy and operational partnerships at those levels in implementing United Nations decisions and programmes as well as outcomes of international conferences ;  
One of the key aspects of operational activities for development is facilitating the transfer of technology and expanding the access to technological information , and the creation of information flows on affordable and sustainable technology which is suitable to a specific country , establishing information networks with relevant institutions and business firms .  
The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) acts with its partners in the international community to assist in meeting the operational challenges of migration , advance understanding of migration issues , encourage social and economic development through migration , and uphold the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  IOM is involved in all phases of mass exoduses , providing technical and operational expertise in such areas as transportation , health , and other services for migrants .

In response , the sponsor delegation pointed to the numerous international organizations and other bodies and entities involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance and stressed the importance of not interfering with their operational procedures and the inadmissibility of using armed force in the provision of humanitarian assistance , which might paralyse the work of international humanitarian organizations and institutions or nullify such activities .  
The Commission focuses its analytical work on designing public policies and facilitates the implementation of such policies , concentrating operational services in the areas of specialized information , advisory assistance , training and support for regional and international cooperation .  
During the biennium 20002001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will focus on further promoting and coordinating the development of a common principled policy on humanitarian issues and on improving the management and practice of operational and strategic coordination through the development of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned and accountability reviews .  
We also call on the United Nations to increase its assistance to the OAU in order to strengthen the operational and institutional capabilities of its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in Africa , in particular by developing the Organizations regional capabilities in early warning and logistical support and by mobilizing the financial resources generated by the two trust funds established by the United Nations and the OAU for those purposes .  
The third specific characteristic of the current efforts for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the creation and functioning of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe , which has , in the five months of its existence , completed the important evolution from political declaration to operational international mechanism .  
He added that while almost every agency and operational arm of the United Nations had a special programme devoted to Africa , and even though the Organization had spent generous amounts of its resources on the continent , the United Nations still needed to be more involved in Africa and play a more effective role , as it does elsewhere , without undue preconditions .

In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
In order to achieve the desired level of independence it is advisable to separate the regulatory functions from operational ones by removing any regulatory functions that may still be vested with the public service providers and entrust them to a legally and functionally independent entity .  
The basic premise is to encourage bilateral and multilateral dialogue so as to promote international understanding and cooperation on the basis of the concepts identified in the preambular paragraphs of this draft : that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress and science and technology for civilian applications need to be maintained and encouraged.There are two operational components to this draft resolution . 
The Bank has defined guidelines , has recommended good practices both for data collection and for calculating annual national average prices for ICP items , and has outlined actual operational procedures .  
For the mandate , this means continuing the catalytic role but now with more of an emphasis on promoting the dissemination and use of the Guiding Principles , monitoring conditions on the ground to detect situations calling for urgent attention , interceding on behalf of the internally displaced as appropriate , and recommending collaborative action by the relevant operational agencies in the international system as well as , of course , the Government concerned .

Mr . Talbot ( Guyana ) speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , reaffirmed that the fundamental characteristics of operational activities universality , neutrality , multilateralism , non-conditionality and responsiveness to the priorities and needs of developing countries in a flexible manner distinguished the operational activities of the United Nations from those of institutions such as the World Bank and were critical to their future effectiveness and credibility .  
Therefore , what is proposed is a decentralized technical , administrative and budgetary approach to a globally coordinated collaborative facilities management based on information exchange and common operational practices is therefore proposed .  
In view of the planned deployment of the Mission throughout the territory of Sierra Leone and the lack of adequate infrastructure in the country , operational requirements of UNAMSIL provide for the construction and maintenance of the expanded Mission and sector headquarters and team sites , enhanced air operations and logistical support and the establishment of reliable and secure United Nations-owned data-processing and communications networks .
