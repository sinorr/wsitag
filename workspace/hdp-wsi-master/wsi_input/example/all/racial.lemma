It was regrettable that racial hatred , intolerance , ethnic persecution and unchecked political ambitions were continuing to cause conflicts leading to such mass movements .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
The international community was currently facing different , although not unfamiliar , problems , namely , the break-up of political entities , conflicts based on religious ideology , the repercussions of the apartheid policies applied in the past and human rights violations engendered by racial and ethnic hatred .  
Deeply concerned that despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grown in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
In Africa , America , Asia , Europe and the Pacific , discriminatory barriers are being thrown up against men and women who , looking for a better life , set out in hopes of finding a place in what is said to be the global village but turns out to have neighbourhoods closed off to some by legislation alluding directly or indirectly to racial identity , national or ethnic origin or preference for nationals .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

During the discussions particular attention was paid to the positive role of the media as an instrument for the protection and promotion of the rights of persons belonging to minorities , as well as to the negative role the media could play by exacerbating problems involving minorities and latent ethnic , religious or racial tensions .  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
The promulgation of numerous international legal human rights instruments ; notable action taken against racism , racial discrimination , religious intolerance and torture ; and support for democratization : these are some of the noteworthy elements of that work .  
The Internet had the alarming potential of creating and reinforcing an electronically disenfranchised underclass , which would prevent the improvement of racial equality in a growing range of human and social needs and transactions .  
The statute also specifies that for rape to be considered a crime against humanity , it must be a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds .  
Conflict , whether at the international , State , or community level , can be considered a natural , inevitable consequence of differing interests , goals or values which may be exacerbated by ethnic , racial , cultural and linguistic differences .

That the accused intended to deprive an identifiable group of persons of life , liberty or security of person because of the target group 's political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural or religious affiliation ;  
The key element of the crime of genocide is the specific intent on the part of the perpetrator to physically destroy , in whole or in part , a protected group , namely a national , ethnic , racial , or religious group .  
The Conference should examine the psychological , social , political and economic factors that made individuals receptive to racism , in view of forecasts concerning future ethnic and racial conflict .  
In addition to the more obvious manifestations , developing countries practised more subtle forms of racial discrimination through immigration laws based on ethnic and regional considerations .  
In the chapeau , her delegation was in favour of the words widespread and systematic and the words on political , philosophical , racial , ethnic or religious grounds or any other arbitrarily defined grounds .  
The Convention has sought to codify certain specific serious crimes committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group as crimes under international law .  
In one multiracial country , Trinidad and Tobago , social studies textbooks utilized at the primary _ school level continue to educate citizens . . . about their diverse racial , religious and cultural society ( CERD / C / 224 / Add . 1 , para .  34 ) .  
In its preliminary conclusions and recommendations , the paper stated that human rights education , with special emphasis on racial discrimination , should not be confined to public and private schools and universities .

Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Factors which give rise to racism and racial discrimination were examined at the seminar on the political , historical , economic , social and cultural factors contributing to racism , racial discrimination and apartheid held at Geneva from 10 to 14 December 1990 .  
The primary causes of racism and racial discrimination are deeply embedded in the historical past and are determined by a number of economic , political , social and cultural factors .  
In the light of ethnic hatred , propaganda and incitement to ethnic killing in the Great Lakes region of Africa , Oxfam suggested that all Governments that prohibit and condemn racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should reinvigorate their commitment to the relevant aspects of international human rights law and international humanitarian law .  
The Government of the United States of America was of the view that the World Conference can make a major contribution to the understanding of racial questions and pave the way for an international dialogue on the subject in coming decades ; its approach should therefore be future _ oriented and constructive . 
The Peruvian Government , for its part , considered that the World Conference should formulate concrete recommendations making it possible to increase the effectiveness of existing machinery used to combat racial discrimination and to adopt additional measures at the national , regional and international levels to strengthen those already in place .  
As for concrete recommendations to combat racial discrimination at the international level , the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that the promotion of genuine dialogue , mutual understanding , a culture of tolerance , and enhanced cooperation and participation would contribute to the gradual realization of a global civil society in which the phenomena of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia are doomed to complete eradication . 
The Anti _ Racism Information Service suggested that the following issues could provide input into recommendations : racial discrimination in the workplace ; migration and related questions ; neo _ Nazism ; Holocaust denial ; the caste system ; inclusion of anti _ racist thought in education ; negative consequences of international trade and globalization ; the despoliation of nature and the overexploitation of natural resources ; ethnocide , ethnic cleansing and violence against women in ethnic conflict .  
Popular and / or politically driven anti-foreigner sentiment based on racial , ethnic , national or religious characteristics is a strong obstacle both to recognition of and respect for the human rights of migrants .  
The accused must undertake one of a series of acts - killing , causing serious bodily or mental harm ; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction ; imposing measures intended to prevent births ; and forcibly transferring children from the group ; ( b ) The accused must do so against a " national , ethnical , racial or religious group " ;  
The requisite intent has support in direct and indirect evidence , including Khmer Rouge statements , eyewitness accounts and the nature and number of victims in each group , both in absolute terms and in proportion to each group 's total population . 12 These groups qualify as protected groups under the Convention : the Muslim Cham as an ethnic and religious group ; the Vietnamese communities as an ethnic and , perhaps , a racial group ; and the Buddhist monkhood as a religious group . 
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .

Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination against , inter alia , Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

The policies of structural adjustment pursued in the 1980s probably contributed in many places to intensified tension between the different ethnic , racial or social groups in society , and may have had enormous cost in terms of lost development opportunities and may have hampered many groups in their enjoyment of the right to food . 
The strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the ability of every person to become a useful member of society , the promotion of understanding , tolerance and friendship among all nations , all racial , ethnic and religious groups are at once the origin , condition and consequence of education aimed at personal development and based on the higher interests of the person educated : 
Subsequent to two amendments , the indictment includes some 37 counts pertaining to alleged crimes of , inter alia , persecution on political , racial and religious grounds , unlawful deportation and transfer , murder , wilful killing , torture , rape , inhumane acts , cruel treatment and wilfully causing great suffering .  
Whether initiating or sponsoring research , training and education on the United Nations and United Nations reform , on the Great Lakes region of Africa , on early conflict warning and prevention , on disarmament , the status of women , racism and racial discrimination , human rights and sustainable development and environmental protection , WFUNA remains committed to examining the critical issues before the United Nations and to help find solutions that will shape our common future .  
In this connection , the recommendation of the representative of the Holy See , made during the preparatory process to the Conference against Racism , is very sound : There is a need to go deeper than historical , cultural , political or social contexts and to identify and understand the spiritual and moral dimensions which underlay the universal human condition and in particular those aspects of it leading to abuses of racial discrimination .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination , and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes , and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication ,  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communication , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity , for promoting racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred , as well as the collection of funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world , Having considered the report submitted by the Secretary-General7 within the framework of the implementation of the Programme of Action ,  
In order to achieve their criminal aims , they actively use political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic or religious slogans .  
The Ministers emphasize that resolute opposition to terrorists sheltering behind political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic and religious slogans is in no way aimed at discrimination against any one of those causes .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Strongly condemns all forms of racial discrimination and xenophobia as regards access to employment , vocational training , housing , schooling , health services and social services , as well as services intended for use by the public , and welcomes the active role played by governmental and non-governmental organizations in combating racism and assisting individual victims of racist acts , including migrant victims ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Ms . Viotti ( Brazil ) said that ethnic cleansing , the resurgence of false doctrines of racial superiority , the trend towards restricting the rights of migrant workers , the use of new technologies to spread intolerance and the abuses committed against asylum-seekers and refugees were just some of the obstacles which the international community must overcome to keep alive the spirit that had inspired the historic struggle to put an end to racism .  
There continued to be widespread manifestations of disguised and increasingly sophisticated forms of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia in the world , particularly in regions with a high level of economic development , a fact that had been recognized and denounced in various forums .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination , and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes , and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication ,  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to the present day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,

The advantage of applying existing international human rights law lies in its comprehensive delineation of the prohibited grounds of discrimination and the corresponding governmental obligations which , in the case of racial and gender discrimination , envisage structural alongside individual measures for the elimination of discrimination .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
The Genocide Convention reiterates the General Assemblys characterization of genocide as a crime under international law , contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world and encapsulates its essential elements as a crime by defining it as any act committed with the specific intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such .  
With the recent resurgence of old ethnic , racial and nationalist antagonisms in various forms of intolerance , xenophobia and , in the most extreme cases , ethnic conflict , ethnic cleansing and genocide , United Nations human rights mechanisms are compelled to reflect on situations where the occurrence of racist acts and racial discrimination could degenerate into open conflict , and recommend timely specific and adequate preventive measures .  
Responses to situations of such conflicts designed to reduce tensions and violence based on ethnic , racial or xenophobic conflicts may include : preventive diplomacy ; early-warning mechanisms ; mediation ; promotion of tolerance through human rights education ; support to democratic institutions through better representation of all segments of the society ; affirmative action ; promotion of multiculturalism .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .

The period marked increased collaboration between ICMC and several Council agencies , particularly those that extended funding for its actions in favour of persons uprooted or forced into flight because of war and conflict , racial or ethnic persecution , human rights violations , and environmental degradation.The ICMC programmes supported by Council agencies included : 
Anyone who , either orally , through the medium of the press or any document or representation , or by any other means , publicly expresses ideas that are offensive to any individual or group of individuals by reason of their racial or ethnic origin or their religion , shall be guilty of a criminal offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a maximum of one year or a maximum fine of 500 Cyprus pounds , or both .  
Anyone whose profession consists in supplying goods or services who refuses to serve an individual solely by reason of their racial or ethnic origin or their religion , or who sets conditions relating to racial or ethnic origin or religion , shall be guilty of a criminal offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a maximum of one year or a maximum fine of 400 Cyprus pounds , or both .  
The Turkish Government is concerned that , despite continuing efforts to increase the vigilance of Governments and arouse international public opinion , contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular against Blacks , Muslims and migrant workers , and xenophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance , continue to exist and even grow in magnitude by adopting subtle new forms .  
The most severe forms of incitement to national , racial and religious hatred , enmity or intolerance are those involving abuse of authority , and are punishable by imprisonment from one to eight years ; should such acts cause riots , violence or other grave consequences for the joint life of nations and national minorities living in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , they are punishable by imprisonment from 1 to 10 years.The said criminal offences may be : 
The criminal offence of racial and other forms of discrimination ( Penal Code of Yugoslavia , art . 54 ) , involving a violation , on the basis of race , skin colour , nationality or ethnic origin , of the fundamental human rights and freedoms recognized by the international community , is punishable by six months to five years imprisonment .  
The argument for including reference to these disasters in the definition is based on cases where Governments respond to such disasters by discriminating against or neglecting certain groups on political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds or by violating the human rights of the affected population in other ways , thereby creating special protection needs .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Apartheid was introduced in 1948 by the National Party as a system of racial segregation designed to maintain a situation of inequality between the Whites and the other ethnic and racial groups living in South Africa , in the economic , social , political and cultural spheres .  
The opposition takes the form of a veiled and persistent conspiracy : the efforts of the white minority to hold on to economic power and privileges , the sabotaging of governmental initiatives within the administrative system , negative propaganda in certain media regarding government activities , and attempts to depict the equal opportunity and affirmative action policies as racism and inverted racial discrimination .  
In his concluding remarks and recommendations , the Special Rapporteur noted that one of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to be persons preventing and combating racial , ethnic or religious discrimination , and persons belonging to minorities .  
A country should be encouraged to put itself forward and consideration should be given , with assistance from the United Nations , to the creation of an international university or foundation for dialogue between cultures and civilizations , which will provide scientific , cultural and legal instruction and undertake on a permanent basis , information and educational activities aimed at eradicating racial prejudices and discrimination .  
States shall take effective measures , with the full consent of the peoples concerned , to eliminate detrimental attitudes of superiority and racial discrimination and to promote tolerance , understanding and friendly relations between indigenous peoples and segments of the national community .  
Mr . Oron ( Israel ) , speaking on agenda item 114 , said that , although hybrid ethnic and national identities had become part of the social landscape , they had not yet become the rule and were all too often accompanied by overt manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .  
In this era , when there are no natural enemies , and thus no natural allies , some seek to advance their political and military ambitions by playing on racial and religious fears to give life to the dangerous doctrine of an impending clash of civilizations .  
Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in paragraph 3 [ of art .  7 ] , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law ;  
Discrimination based on racial , social , ethnic , economic , and even geographical and language considerations , is not only very palpable in the attitudes of the ordinary people in the streets , it is also very clearly present in government policies .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
The episodes of ethnic cleansing committed throughout the history of humanity were intended to harm both the racial , religious and cultural identity of a group or people , at times its very physical existence .  
In the future , combating racial discrimination would be more difficult as it would be expressed less and less in crude forms of colour discrimination , but rather would be combined with class and other material conditions .  
That Convention was broader in substantive terms since it covered civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , while the European Convention prohibited racial discrimination in the framework of civil and political rights .  
The States concerned reaffirmed that terrorist acts were in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .

The Statute defines the forcible transfer of the children of a threatened national , ethnic , racial or religious group to another group as genocide , while rape and sexual slavery are classified as both war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
At the same time , the Algerian Government has pursued its active and affirmative policy of supporting measures aimed at combating , at the international level , all forms of political , racial and religious discrimination .

Reviewing the political , historical , economic , social , cultural and any other factors leading to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance with a view to reaching a better understanding of and appraising these problems ;  
In chapter IV of the report , the Special Rapporteur describes the general context and discusses the following topics which are of special concern to her : ( a ) situation of irregular migrants ; ( b ) sale of fraudulent documents ; ( c ) situation of migrant women and unaccompanied minors ; ( d ) undocumented children without access to health care and education ; ( e ) broken families ; and ( f ) racism , xenophobia and racial discrimination .  
He wished to know whether the Special Rapporteur was participating in the preparatory regional meetings for the World Conference , whether he had attended the preparatory meeting in Strasbourg and what his relations were with the Council of Europe , which was intimately concerned with issues of racism and racial discrimination .  52 .  Regarding contemporary forms of racism , he wondered whether the Special Rapporteur considered that they were linked with new forms of criminal behaviour , inter-ethnic conflict and economic discrimination .  
In addition to the five major themes on its agenda , the World Conference should also take up other important issues , especially ways to reduce ethnic tensions and to prevent ethnic and racial conflicts ; the economic impact of racism ; discrimination against migrant workers ; the question of asylum-seekers , refugees and disabled persons ; trafficking in human beings ; assaults on minorities and vulnerable groups ; the rights of indigenous peoples ; and the role of the Internet and of communications technologies .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention , are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Stressing that the fight against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance is an arduous task , the proof from the most recent African experience being the enormous African sacrifices made and the unabated struggle waged for decades before Africa could convince the rest of the world of the imperative and urgent necessity of dismantling the abhorrent institutionalized racist system of apartheid ,  
Note with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be victims of varied , evolving and sophisticated contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular nationals of different origins , migrant workers , asylum-seekers , refugees and foreigners ;  
Express our concern that beyond the material progress of racism is the disturbing fact that contemporary forms and manifestations of racism are striving to regain political , moral and even legal recognition in many ways , including through legislative prescriptions such as those relating to the freedom of expression , the platforms of some political parties and organizations , and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on racial superiority ;  
Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
Stress the negative economic consequences of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , conscious that the economic difficulties of Africa can not be explained exclusively by foreign factors and historical events and aware that it is nevertheless a reality that those factors and events have had profound crippling effects on the economic development of Africa and that justice now requires that substantial national and international efforts be made to repair the damage ;  
Also reaffirm that the stigmatization of people of different origins by acts or omissions of public authorities , institutions , the media , political parties or national or local organizations is not only an act of racial discrimination but also an incitement to the recurrence of such acts , thereby resulting in the creation of a vicious circle which reinforces racist attitudes and prejudices ; such acts should be declared offences and crimes punishable by law ;  
Recall that article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination already contains the obligation to provide effective protection and remedies for everyone against any acts of racial discrimination which violate human rights and fundamental freedoms , a principle reaffirmed by numerous subsequent human rights instruments including the basic principles and guidelines on the right to a remedy and reparation for victims of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Strongly reaffirm that States which pursued racist policies or acts of racial discrimination such as slavery and colonialism should assume their moral , economic , political and legal responsibilities within their national jurisdiction and before other appropriate international mechanisms or jurisdictions and provide adequate reparation to those communities or individuals who , individually or collectively , are victims of such racist policies or acts , regardless of when or by whom they were committed ;  
Also strongly reaffirm that as a pressing requirement of justice , victims of human rights violations as a result of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should be assured effective protection and remedies as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage as a result of violations in the implementation of human rights standards ;  
Also affirm in particular that the victims right to have access to justice is of special importance to victims of racial discrimination in the light of their vulnerable situation , socially , culturally and economically , and that the principle of equality of victims in legal systems is meaningless unless it is accompanied by affirmative action ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world ,  
Stressing also the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination , and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes , and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication ,  
Indonesia concurred with the observation made by the expert seminar that questions of racism and racial discrimination were complex and demanded comprehensive solutions that not only included legal provisions but also addressed social , economic and cultural issues .  
Racism was , on the one hand , fear of the unknown a fear which , in extreme situations , could lead to racial cleansing in the desire to eliminate all differences and , on the other , a lack of curiosity , patience and understanding vis - - vis other people .  Yet cultures needed diversity to flourish , while racist behaviour stemmed from social pressure , assumptions and misconceptions .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world ,  
Stressing also the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination , and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes , and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication ,  
Condemn all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related forms of intolerance concerning economic , social and cultural rights and other related matters , including access to employment , government benefits , access to capital , credit , technology , education and vocational training , housing , health care , the environment , cultural activities , the protection of heritage , equal access to public services and other types of services , and national immigration policies ;  
Express our conviction that political platforms based on racism , xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and discrimination must be condemned as incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance , and that racial discrimination condoned by governmental policies violates human rights and may endanger friendly relations among peoples , cooperation among nations , and international peace and security ;  
Underscore the need to promote strategies , programmes and policies , which may include measures of affirmative action , for furthering the fulfilment of civil and political rights for victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including through more effective access to the political , judicial and administrative functions of institutions , as well as the need to increase access to the administration of justice in all its forms , free from racial discrimination of any kind ;  
Recognize that education and lifelong learning are basic for the respect of the racial , ethnic , cultural , linguistic and religious diversity of our societies which is essential to prevent the spread of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and is of key importance for protecting and promoting democratic values ;  
Recognize the necessity of increasing appropriate preventive measures in order to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination , and the important role that international organizations , Governments , local authorities , the media , non-governmental organizations and civil society can play in developing such measures and building confidence between different racial and ethnic groups ;  
Urge States to adopt or strengthen , as appropriate , national programmes for eradicating poverty among indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , and also request that they expand their efforts to foster bilateral , regional and international cooperation in implementing those programmes ;  
Urge States to reaffirm their democratic commitment and take the necessary legislative , administrative and judicial measures , in accordance with their obligations under regional and international human rights instruments , to condemn and actively discourage all forms of propaganda , publicity , organizations , associations , political parties or groups inspired by ideas or theories of the superiority of one race or ethnic group and that seek to justify or promote racial hatred , xenophobia or racial discrimination ;

Request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation among States , and between them and international organizations for the purpose of concluding agreements , coordinating activities and developing programmes in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination ;  
Request the operational programmes and agencies of the United Nations , financial and development institutions , in accordance with their mandates , to assign higher priority and provide more funding to projects in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination , and to include such vulnerable groups at the stage of the development and implementation of projects concerning them ;  
Urge States to consider taking special measures to protect especially vulnerable persons and groups which may be subject to multiple forms of discrimination on account of their gender , age , national origin , sexual orientation , social or economic status , physical or mental disability , state of health , religious belief or any other condition liable to give rise to discrimination , including racial discrimination ;  
Also invite them to ensure their full enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in particular women , children and vulnerable groups , so that persons who admit to an HIV infection , those presumably infected and other persons affected are protected against violence , stigmatization , discrimination , unemployment and other negative consequences which may be compounded by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
Further request States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Also urge them to provide an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the different culture and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities have played in building national identities in the Americas , and historical and contemporary examples of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance directed against these groups ;  
Encourage all relevant actors to intensify their efforts at the national , regional and international levels , especially by means of education , to ensure that children are educated from an early age in those values , attitudes and ways of conduct and life that will allow them to resolve conflicts of a racial or ethnic character peacefully , in a spirit of respect for human dignity , tolerance and non-discrimination ;  
Urge States to discourage advertising that portrays stereotypical or otherwise negative images of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants , and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , and to encourage advertising that promotes a broader understanding of these victims of racism and fosters the values of diversity , tolerance and mutual respect ;  
Invite States to take appropriate constitutional , legislative and administrative measures , to foster equality among individuals , indigenous peoples , among people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities whose members are frequently victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and review existing measures with a view to amending or repealing national legislation and administrative provisions that may give rise to discrimination ;  
Request States to make a serious commitment to adopting more appropriate measures to ( a ) combat illegal acts motivated by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance against individuals , communities or groups of persons ; ( b ) protect victims of discrimination and provide them with security against future threats ; ( c ) punish those responsible for such crimes and violations of human rights ; and ( d ) make every effort to ensure that national and local public authorities act accordingly ;  
Urge States to give special attention , when promoting and implementing legislative and judicial policies designed to give workers adequate protection , to the serious situation of lack of protection and , in some cases , the exploitation or trafficking of victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , a situation that allows or facilitates confinement , as in the case of domestic workers and dangerous and badly paid jobs ;  
Urge States to design , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers who are victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and other related intolerance including , persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or be victims of illegal trafficking ;  
Urge the international community to take cognizance of the very real difficulties that peoples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds inevitably experience in seeking to live together and to develop genuine harmonious multiracial societies .  
Convinced of the fundamental importance of universal accession or ratification to and full implementation of [ the / our ] obligations arising under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as the principal international instrument to eliminate racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance [ based on race , color , descent , or national or ethnic origin ] ,  
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
PP8bis Reaffirming our commitment to combating all manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance on grounds of [ race , lineage , colour , religion , culture , language or national or ethnic origin * ] [ aggravated by forms of multiple discrimination based on reasons of age , gender , [ sexual orientation ] , physical and mental ability disability , or socio-economic status * ] ,  
The Commission also called for the condemnation of all forms of racism and racial discrimination , and for concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields , through improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services , in order to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights for all women and girls .  
In addition , under article 7 ( h ) , [ p ] ersecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law is also considered a crime against humanity .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
[ 10 ] After considering information in States parties reports concerning the ways in which individuals are identified as being members of a particular racial or ethnic group , the Committee stated that such identification should , if no justification existed to the contrary , be based upon self-identification by the individual concerned . 
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We recognize and admit that slavery and the slave trade , other forms of servitude , conquest and colonialism were the primary sources and manifestation / a source of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and condemn the injustices that were committed , especially against Africans , people of African descent and indigenous peoples and stress the need for all States which were engaged in such practices to acknowledge the grave human suffering they caused and the heinous racist acts committed ;  
We recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
We regret the existence of inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions in which intolerance and racial discrimination breed and fester , and we believe that genuine equality of opportunity for development is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .  
We also understand that discrimination contributes to inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions , and that genuine equality of opportunity [ for development ] is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We firmly believe that education , development and the faithful implementation of our international human rights norms / obligations , including enactment of laws and political , social and economic policies , are crucial to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We express deep concern about the use of new information technologies , such as the Internet , for purposes contrary to respect for human values , equality , non-discrimination , respect for others and tolerance , including to propagate racism , racial hatred , xenophobia , racial discrimination and related intolerance , and that children and youth have access to this material ; others / [ respect and tolerance for diversity ] ; [ and urge their continued and enhanced use in this respect ; ] .  
We reaffirm that the stigmatization of people of different origins by acts or omissions of public authorities , institutions , the media , political parties or national or local organizations is not only an act of racial discrimination but also an incitement to the recurrence of such acts , thereby resulting in the creation of a vicious circle which reinforces racist attitudes and prejudices ; such acts should be declared offences and crimes punishable by law ;  
We underline the essential contribution of independent specialized bodies at national , regional or local levels in promoting equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin or religious background ;  
We recognize that international and national exchange and dialogue [ among youth ] / [ at all levels , in particular educational institutions , religious authorities and youth associations ] , and the development of a global network among youth are important and fundamental elements in building intercultural understanding and respect and will contribute to the elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Urges States to design or reinforce , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies , as well as other preventive measures , against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers , including migrant workers , persons of migrant origin and foreign workers , who are vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or victims of illegal trafficking .  
Urges States [ to adopt and implement , or strengthen wherever necessary , national legislation and administrative measures that expressly and specifically counter racism and prohibit racial discrimination , whether direct or indirect , in all spheres of public life in conformity with the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination without making limiting reservations and to review existing measures with a view to amending or revising national legislation and administrative provisions that may give rise to discrimination ;  
Urges States to take the necessary measures to ensure that no person will be expelled , extradited or returned to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture or persecution on account of his or her [ race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ] racial , ethnic , cultural , religious , linguistic , or national origin [ or political affiliation ] ;  
Urges States to work with law enforcement agencies in designing , implementing and enforcing effective policies and programmes to prevent , detect and ensure accountability for incidents of police misconduct motivated by race or ethnic origin , to prosecute such police misconduct and to eliminate racial profiling by law enforcement officials or the use of race or ethnicity as the sole basis for determining if an individual is engaged in criminal activity ;  
Urges States to take concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields through , inter alia , improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Urges States to establish national programmes to promote the access , without any discrimination , of people of African descent , Mestizos , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , linguistic and religious groups , minorities , and indigenous peoples , where they exist , to education , medical care and other social services and to eliminate by the year 2010 the disparities these groups experience , inter alia in infant mortality rate , childhood immunization , HIV / AIDS , heart disease , cancer and contagious diseases ;  
Urges Governments to counter social exclusion and marginalization of racial , ethnic , cultural , religious , linguistic and national minorities , in particular by providing de facto equal access to education , health services , employment and housing ;  
The World Conference also requests States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;

Urges States , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to take steps to improve access to public information on health and environmental issues by all people , including those affected by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; identify and address the adverse effects of government policies and programmes on the human health and environment in targeted areas ; and promote compliance with and enforcement of all health and environmental laws , including in areas inhabited by racial or ethnic minorities , indigenous peoples , or low-income populations ;  
Urges / invites Governments , the private sector and international [ financial ] institutions , [ particularly / including the World Bank and regional development banks ] , to promote participation by persons belonging to / members of all groups , including [ minority groups ] individuals and groups affected by or vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in economic , cultural and social decision-making at all stages and levels [ in the development and implementation of poverty alleviation strategies , development projects , and trade and market assistance programmes ] ;  
It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
It also urges them to provide the mainstream education with an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the individuals and groups from different cultures and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous people , people of African descent , Roma , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups and minorities have played in building national identifies ; 
Greater emphasis should be placed on teaching the history of national , racial , linguistic , cultural , religious and ethnic minorities [ and of the history of neighbouring countries ] with the aim of achieving mutual respect and understanding for others culture , religion or history / as well as of their contribution to the whole civil society ;  
Calls upon Calls uponStrongly recommends to participating States to introduce , or encourage the introduction of , or reinforce , human rights education , including promoting anti-racism , with a view to combating prejudices which lead to racial discrimination and to promoting understanding , tolerance and friendship between different racial or ethnic groups in school curricula and in institutions of higher education and to support public formal and non-formal education programmes designed to promote cultural diversity and self-esteem of vulnerable groups ;  
Urges States to take all necessary measures to address , as a matter of urgency , the pressing requirement for justice for the victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and to ensure that victims have full access to information , support , effective protection and national , administrative and judicial remedies , as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage ;  
For the purposes of effectively combating racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance in the civil , political , economic , social and cultural fields , the World Conference recommends to all Member States that their national legislative framework in criminal , civil and administrative law should expressly and specifically prohibit discrimination on grounds of actual or presumed racial , ethnic or national origin , religion and belief and provide effective judicial and other remedies or redress , including through the designation of national , independent , specialized bodies .  
Strongly urges States which pursued policies or practices based on racial or national superiority , such as colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , slavery , the slave trade and ethnic cleansing , to assume their full responsibility therefor and provide prompt , adequate and fair reparation and compensation to those States , communities and individuals who were victims of such policies or practices , regardless of when they were committed ; V . STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE FULL AND EFFECTIVE EQUALITY ,  
Urges the international community to take cognizance of the very real difficulties that peoples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds inevitably experience in seeking to live together and to develop genuine harmonious multiracial societies .  
Furthermore it urges them to work in partnership at the national , regional and international levels to develop appropriate policy tools that facilitate the development of legislation , policies and programmes that take into account ethnic , racial , linguistic , religious and cultural diversity ;  
Recommends that the Commission on Human Rights prepare complementary international standards to strengthen and update international legislation against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including by drawing up an international code of ethics for communications media , especially the Internet , that includes specific measures to combat the unlawful dissemination of information that is racist , discriminatory , xenophobic or relating to intolerance ;  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;  
Noting that in its resolution 52 / 111 of 12 December 1997 , in which it decided to convene the World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , the General Assembly set as one of the main objectives of the Conference the review of the political , historical , social , cultural and other factors leading to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ,  
The General Assembly reaffirmed the responsibility of Governments to safeguard and protect the rights of migrants against illegal or violent acts , in particular acts of racial discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals or groups , and urged them to reinforce measures in that regard ; urged all States to adopt effective measures to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and detention of migrants , including by individuals or groups ; and called upon all States to protect the human rights of migrant children , in particular unaccompanied migrant children .  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;  
In other words , States that were previously in a position to ensure a legal regime of information exchange at their own internal level find themselves defenceless , in the new situation , against the transmission from abroad to their territory of information which may be unlawful or destructive , including pornography , disinformation , information indicative of racial discrimination or intolerance , information aimed at inciting social , national or religious hatred , information of a subversive nature or information emanating from and serving the interests of international criminal and terrorist groups .  
He noted with regret that despite all the collective commitments made by heads of State and Government at the various international conferences held over the past decade and in the Millennium Declaration particularly with regard to social development and poverty eradication , national , regional and international challenges to the fulfilment of those commitments , such as armed and civil racial conflicts , genocide , enforced displacement , the proliferation of drugs , organized crime and terrorism against innocent persons were increasing in an unprecedented manner .  
However , over a-billion people had continued to live in extreme poverty , with millions of people unemployed , and a growing number of societies breaking up along racial , ethnic or social fault lines .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Therefore , the delegations of Ecuador , Brazil , Chile , Canada and Guatemala reaffirm the importance for the strengthening and advancement of human rights and the combat of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , of developing , implementing and improving specific policies and programmes to address effectively a serious form of multiple discrimination , which occurs when racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance intersect with discrimination based on sexual orientation .  
The World Conference should acknowledge that differences in ethnic identities have long manifested themselves in diverse ways , but should recognize that the racism of the colonial era constituted an unprecedented system of thought and action that has a specific historical origin in the transatlantic slave trade and the consequent development of the global racial chattel enslavement of Africans .  
States are invited to compile and publish statistical data broken down by racial and ethnic groups in the areas of health , system of criminal justice , housing , education and employment , with a view to determining whether policies or programmes are having a disproportionate impact on such groups , and to take supplementary measures , when drawing up and evaluating individual policies and programmes , in order to remedy such impact ;  
Take concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields , through , inter alia , improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights for all women and girls ;  
Urges States to support national human rights institutions or similar bodies responsible for combating racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , inter alia by promoting quantitative , qualitative and gender-sensitive research on the subject with the participation of those being researched , the publication and circulation of existing national laws and jurisprudence , and cooperation with institutions in other countries so that knowledge can be gained of the manifestations , functioning and mechanisms of these practices and the strategies designed to prevent , combat and eradicate them ;  
Recognize that sexual violence during armed conflict constituting serious violations of international humanitarian law has been used as a tool of systematic forms of discrimination , abuse and genocide directed against racial or ethnic populations of non-combatants , and that race and gender combine to make women particularly vulnerable to certain types of violence , particularly sexual violence ;  
Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in paragraph 3 , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law , in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court ;  
To develop policies and action plans , and to reinforce and implement preventive measures , to foster greater harmony and tolerance between migrant workers and host societies with the aim of eliminating the growing manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including acts of violence , perpetrated in many societies by individuals or groups and directed towards migrant workers and their families , persons of migrant origin and resident foreign workers ;  
Effective legal and judicial cooperation at the regional and international levels in combating acts of racism , [ anti-Semitism ] , racial discrimination , and xenophobia and related intolerance to prevent the perpetrators of racist and xenophobic these acts from benefiting from the fact that offences are treated differently in various States ;  
Include in their regular reporting to their boards of governors information on their contributions to promoting the participation of people of African descent , indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups within their organizations , and information on their efforts to facilitate the participation of racial , ethnic , religious , cultural and other minorities in the economic , social , political and cultural life of their countries ;  
To work with health-care professionals , community-based health providers , non-governmental organizations , scientific researchers and private industry as a means of improving the health status of marginalized communities , in particular victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; bis To work with health professionals , scientific researchers and international and regional health organizations to study the differential impacts of medical treatments and health strategies on various communities ;  
The world we live in today is not really at peace ; for economic , political , and other reasons , the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time ; ethnic contradictions , sectarian disputes , racial discrimination , regional conflicts , and partial wars occur from time to time and are rather serious in certain countries and regions ;  
The citizens of Cincinnati were extremely angry after this incident of acting with total disregard for human life occurred , and protest demonstrations developed into violent citywide racial clashes .  
In fact , this incident in which a white policeman shot and killed a black is just the tip of the iceberg in America 's long-running racial problem , and the racial violence that it triggered was by no means accidental ; nor was it an isolated incident , but the evil result of racial discrimination in America .

The international community was currently facing different , although not unfamiliar , problems , namely , the break-up of political entities , conflicts based on religious ideology , the repercussions of the apartheid policies applied in the past and human rights violations engendered by racial and ethnic hatred .  
Deeply concerned that despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grown in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
In Africa , America , Asia , Europe and the Pacific , discriminatory barriers are being thrown up against men and women who , looking for a better life , set out in hopes of finding a place in what is said to be the global village but turns out to have neighbourhoods closed off to some by legislation alluding directly or indirectly to racial identity , national or ethnic origin or preference for nationals .

The promulgation of numerous international legal human rights instruments ; notable action taken against racism , racial discrimination , religious intolerance and torture ; and support for democratization : these are some of the noteworthy elements of that work .  
The Internet had the alarming potential of creating and reinforcing an electronically disenfranchised underclass , which would prevent the improvement of racial equality in a growing range of human and social needs and transactions .  
The statute also specifies that for rape to be considered a crime against humanity , it must be a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds .

The key element of the crime of genocide is the specific intent on the part of the perpetrator to physically destroy , in whole or in part , a protected group , namely a national , ethnic , racial , or religious group .  
The Conference should examine the psychological , social , political and economic factors that made individuals receptive to racism , in view of forecasts concerning future ethnic and racial conflict .

In the chapeau , her delegation was in favour of the words widespread and systematic and the words on political , philosophical , racial , ethnic or religious grounds or any other arbitrarily defined grounds .  
The Convention has sought to codify certain specific serious crimes committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group as crimes under international law .  
In one multiracial country , Trinidad and Tobago , social studies textbooks utilized at the primary _ school level continue to educate citizens . . . about their diverse racial , religious and cultural society ( CERD / C / 224 / Add . 1 , para .  34 ) .

Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Factors which give rise to racism and racial discrimination were examined at the seminar on the political , historical , economic , social and cultural factors contributing to racism , racial discrimination and apartheid held at Geneva from 10 to 14 December 1990 .  
The primary causes of racism and racial discrimination are deeply embedded in the historical past and are determined by a number of economic , political , social and cultural factors .  
In the light of ethnic hatred , propaganda and incitement to ethnic killing in the Great Lakes region of Africa , Oxfam suggested that all Governments that prohibit and condemn racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should reinvigorate their commitment to the relevant aspects of international human rights law and international humanitarian law .  
The Government of the United States of America was of the view that the World Conference can make a major contribution to the understanding of racial questions and pave the way for an international dialogue on the subject in coming decades ; its approach should therefore be future _ oriented and constructive . 
The Peruvian Government , for its part , considered that the World Conference should formulate concrete recommendations making it possible to increase the effectiveness of existing machinery used to combat racial discrimination and to adopt additional measures at the national , regional and international levels to strengthen those already in place .  
As for concrete recommendations to combat racial discrimination at the international level , the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that the promotion of genuine dialogue , mutual understanding , a culture of tolerance , and enhanced cooperation and participation would contribute to the gradual realization of a global civil society in which the phenomena of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia are doomed to complete eradication . 
The Anti _ Racism Information Service suggested that the following issues could provide input into recommendations : racial discrimination in the workplace ; migration and related questions ; neo _ Nazism ; Holocaust denial ; the caste system ; inclusion of anti _ racist thought in education ; negative consequences of international trade and globalization ; the despoliation of nature and the overexploitation of natural resources ; ethnocide , ethnic cleansing and violence against women in ethnic conflict .  
Popular and / or politically driven anti-foreigner sentiment based on racial , ethnic , national or religious characteristics is a strong obstacle both to recognition of and respect for the human rights of migrants .

The requisite intent has support in direct and indirect evidence , including Khmer Rouge statements , eyewitness accounts and the nature and number of victims in each group , both in absolute terms and in proportion to each group 's total population . 12 These groups qualify as protected groups under the Convention : the Muslim Cham as an ethnic and religious group ; the Vietnamese communities as an ethnic and , perhaps , a racial group ; and the Buddhist monkhood as a religious group . 
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .

Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination against , inter alia , Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

The policies of structural adjustment pursued in the 1980s probably contributed in many places to intensified tension between the different ethnic , racial or social groups in society , and may have had enormous cost in terms of lost development opportunities and may have hampered many groups in their enjoyment of the right to food . 
The strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the ability of every person to become a useful member of society , the promotion of understanding , tolerance and friendship among all nations , all racial , ethnic and religious groups are at once the origin , condition and consequence of education aimed at personal development and based on the higher interests of the person educated : 
Subsequent to two amendments , the indictment includes some 37 counts pertaining to alleged crimes of , inter alia , persecution on political , racial and religious grounds , unlawful deportation and transfer , murder , wilful killing , torture , rape , inhumane acts , cruel treatment and wilfully causing great suffering .  
Whether initiating or sponsoring research , training and education on the United Nations and United Nations reform , on the Great Lakes region of Africa , on early conflict warning and prevention , on disarmament , the status of women , racism and racial discrimination , human rights and sustainable development and environmental protection , WFUNA remains committed to examining the critical issues before the United Nations and to help find solutions that will shape our common future .  
In this connection , the recommendation of the representative of the Holy See , made during the preparatory process to the Conference against Racism , is very sound : There is a need to go deeper than historical , cultural , political or social contexts and to identify and understand the spiritual and moral dimensions which underlay the universal human condition and in particular those aspects of it leading to abuses of racial discrimination .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination , and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes , and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication ,  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communication , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity , for promoting racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred , as well as the collection of funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world , Having considered the report submitted by the Secretary-General7 within the framework of the implementation of the Programme of Action ,  
In order to achieve their criminal aims , they actively use political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic or religious slogans .  
The Ministers emphasize that resolute opposition to terrorists sheltering behind political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic and religious slogans is in no way aimed at discrimination against any one of those causes .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Strongly condemns all forms of racial discrimination and xenophobia as regards access to employment , vocational training , housing , schooling , health services and social services , as well as services intended for use by the public , and welcomes the active role played by governmental and non-governmental organizations in combating racism and assisting individual victims of racist acts , including migrant victims ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Ms . Viotti ( Brazil ) said that ethnic cleansing , the resurgence of false doctrines of racial superiority , the trend towards restricting the rights of migrant workers , the use of new technologies to spread intolerance and the abuses committed against asylum-seekers and refugees were just some of the obstacles which the international community must overcome to keep alive the spirit that had inspired the historic struggle to put an end to racism .  
There continued to be widespread manifestations of disguised and increasingly sophisticated forms of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia in the world , particularly in regions with a high level of economic development , a fact that had been recognized and denounced in various forums .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination , and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes , and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication ,

The advantage of applying existing international human rights law lies in its comprehensive delineation of the prohibited grounds of discrimination and the corresponding governmental obligations which , in the case of racial and gender discrimination , envisage structural alongside individual measures for the elimination of discrimination .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
The Genocide Convention reiterates the General Assemblys characterization of genocide as a crime under international law , contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world and encapsulates its essential elements as a crime by defining it as any act committed with the specific intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such .  
With the recent resurgence of old ethnic , racial and nationalist antagonisms in various forms of intolerance , xenophobia and , in the most extreme cases , ethnic conflict , ethnic cleansing and genocide , United Nations human rights mechanisms are compelled to reflect on situations where the occurrence of racist acts and racial discrimination could degenerate into open conflict , and recommend timely specific and adequate preventive measures .  
Responses to situations of such conflicts designed to reduce tensions and violence based on ethnic , racial or xenophobic conflicts may include : preventive diplomacy ; early-warning mechanisms ; mediation ; promotion of tolerance through human rights education ; support to democratic institutions through better representation of all segments of the society ; affirmative action ; promotion of multiculturalism .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .

The period marked increased collaboration between ICMC and several Council agencies , particularly those that extended funding for its actions in favour of persons uprooted or forced into flight because of war and conflict , racial or ethnic persecution , human rights violations , and environmental degradation.The ICMC programmes supported by Council agencies included : 
Anyone who , either orally , through the medium of the press or any document or representation , or by any other means , publicly expresses ideas that are offensive to any individual or group of individuals by reason of their racial or ethnic origin or their religion , shall be guilty of a criminal offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a maximum of one year or a maximum fine of 500 Cyprus pounds , or both .  
Anyone whose profession consists in supplying goods or services who refuses to serve an individual solely by reason of their racial or ethnic origin or their religion , or who sets conditions relating to racial or ethnic origin or religion , shall be guilty of a criminal offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a maximum of one year or a maximum fine of 400 Cyprus pounds , or both .  
The Turkish Government is concerned that , despite continuing efforts to increase the vigilance of Governments and arouse international public opinion , contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular against Blacks , Muslims and migrant workers , and xenophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance , continue to exist and even grow in magnitude by adopting subtle new forms .  
The most severe forms of incitement to national , racial and religious hatred , enmity or intolerance are those involving abuse of authority , and are punishable by imprisonment from one to eight years ; should such acts cause riots , violence or other grave consequences for the joint life of nations and national minorities living in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , they are punishable by imprisonment from 1 to 10 years.The said criminal offences may be : 
The criminal offence of racial and other forms of discrimination ( Penal Code of Yugoslavia , art . 54 ) , involving a violation , on the basis of race , skin colour , nationality or ethnic origin , of the fundamental human rights and freedoms recognized by the international community , is punishable by six months to five years imprisonment .  
The argument for including reference to these disasters in the definition is based on cases where Governments respond to such disasters by discriminating against or neglecting certain groups on political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds or by violating the human rights of the affected population in other ways , thereby creating special protection needs .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Apartheid was introduced in 1948 by the National Party as a system of racial segregation designed to maintain a situation of inequality between the Whites and the other ethnic and racial groups living in South Africa , in the economic , social , political and cultural spheres .  
The opposition takes the form of a veiled and persistent conspiracy : the efforts of the white minority to hold on to economic power and privileges , the sabotaging of governmental initiatives within the administrative system , negative propaganda in certain media regarding government activities , and attempts to depict the equal opportunity and affirmative action policies as racism and inverted racial discrimination .  
In his concluding remarks and recommendations , the Special Rapporteur noted that one of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to be persons preventing and combating racial , ethnic or religious discrimination , and persons belonging to minorities .  
A country should be encouraged to put itself forward and consideration should be given , with assistance from the United Nations , to the creation of an international university or foundation for dialogue between cultures and civilizations , which will provide scientific , cultural and legal instruction and undertake on a permanent basis , information and educational activities aimed at eradicating racial prejudices and discrimination .  
States shall take effective measures , with the full consent of the peoples concerned , to eliminate detrimental attitudes of superiority and racial discrimination and to promote tolerance , understanding and friendly relations between indigenous peoples and segments of the national community .  
Mr . Oron ( Israel ) , speaking on agenda item 114 , said that , although hybrid ethnic and national identities had become part of the social landscape , they had not yet become the rule and were all too often accompanied by overt manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .  
In this era , when there are no natural enemies , and thus no natural allies , some seek to advance their political and military ambitions by playing on racial and religious fears to give life to the dangerous doctrine of an impending clash of civilizations .  
Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in paragraph 3 [ of art .  7 ] , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law ;  
Discrimination based on racial , social , ethnic , economic , and even geographical and language considerations , is not only very palpable in the attitudes of the ordinary people in the streets , it is also very clearly present in government policies .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
The episodes of ethnic cleansing committed throughout the history of humanity were intended to harm both the racial , religious and cultural identity of a group or people , at times its very physical existence .  
In the future , combating racial discrimination would be more difficult as it would be expressed less and less in crude forms of colour discrimination , but rather would be combined with class and other material conditions .  
That Convention was broader in substantive terms since it covered civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , while the European Convention prohibited racial discrimination in the framework of civil and political rights .  
The States concerned reaffirmed that terrorist acts were in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
The Statute defines the forcible transfer of the children of a threatened national , ethnic , racial or religious group to another group as genocide , while rape and sexual slavery are classified as both war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
At the same time , the Algerian Government has pursued its active and affirmative policy of supporting measures aimed at combating , at the international level , all forms of political , racial and religious discrimination .

Reviewing the political , historical , economic , social , cultural and any other factors leading to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance with a view to reaching a better understanding of and appraising these problems ;  
In chapter IV of the report , the Special Rapporteur describes the general context and discusses the following topics which are of special concern to her : ( a ) situation of irregular migrants ; ( b ) sale of fraudulent documents ; ( c ) situation of migrant women and unaccompanied minors ; ( d ) undocumented children without access to health care and education ; ( e ) broken families ; and ( f ) racism , xenophobia and racial discrimination .  
He wished to know whether the Special Rapporteur was participating in the preparatory regional meetings for the World Conference , whether he had attended the preparatory meeting in Strasbourg and what his relations were with the Council of Europe , which was intimately concerned with issues of racism and racial discrimination .  52 .  Regarding contemporary forms of racism , he wondered whether the Special Rapporteur considered that they were linked with new forms of criminal behaviour , inter-ethnic conflict and economic discrimination .  
In addition to the five major themes on its agenda , the World Conference should also take up other important issues , especially ways to reduce ethnic tensions and to prevent ethnic and racial conflicts ; the economic impact of racism ; discrimination against migrant workers ; the question of asylum-seekers , refugees and disabled persons ; trafficking in human beings ; assaults on minorities and vulnerable groups ; the rights of indigenous peoples ; and the role of the Internet and of communications technologies .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention , are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Stressing that the fight against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance is an arduous task , the proof from the most recent African experience being the enormous African sacrifices made and the unabated struggle waged for decades before Africa could convince the rest of the world of the imperative and urgent necessity of dismantling the abhorrent institutionalized racist system of apartheid ,  
Note with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be victims of varied , evolving and sophisticated contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular nationals of different origins , migrant workers , asylum-seekers , refugees and foreigners ;  
Express our concern that beyond the material progress of racism is the disturbing fact that contemporary forms and manifestations of racism are striving to regain political , moral and even legal recognition in many ways , including through legislative prescriptions such as those relating to the freedom of expression , the platforms of some political parties and organizations , and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on racial superiority ;  
Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
Stress the negative economic consequences of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , conscious that the economic difficulties of Africa can not be explained exclusively by foreign factors and historical events and aware that it is nevertheless a reality that those factors and events have had profound crippling effects on the economic development of Africa and that justice now requires that substantial national and international efforts be made to repair the damage ;  
Also reaffirm that the stigmatization of people of different origins by acts or omissions of public authorities , institutions , the media , political parties or national or local organizations is not only an act of racial discrimination but also an incitement to the recurrence of such acts , thereby resulting in the creation of a vicious circle which reinforces racist attitudes and prejudices ; such acts should be declared offences and crimes punishable by law ;  
Recall that article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination already contains the obligation to provide effective protection and remedies for everyone against any acts of racial discrimination which violate human rights and fundamental freedoms , a principle reaffirmed by numerous subsequent human rights instruments including the basic principles and guidelines on the right to a remedy and reparation for victims of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Strongly reaffirm that States which pursued racist policies or acts of racial discrimination such as slavery and colonialism should assume their moral , economic , political and legal responsibilities within their national jurisdiction and before other appropriate international mechanisms or jurisdictions and provide adequate reparation to those communities or individuals who , individually or collectively , are victims of such racist policies or acts , regardless of when or by whom they were committed ;  
Also strongly reaffirm that as a pressing requirement of justice , victims of human rights violations as a result of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should be assured effective protection and remedies as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage as a result of violations in the implementation of human rights standards ;  
Also affirm in particular that the victims right to have access to justice is of special importance to victims of racial discrimination in the light of their vulnerable situation , socially , culturally and economically , and that the principle of equality of victims in legal systems is meaningless unless it is accompanied by affirmative action ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world ,  
Stressing also the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination , and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes , and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication ,  
Indonesia concurred with the observation made by the expert seminar that questions of racism and racial discrimination were complex and demanded comprehensive solutions that not only included legal provisions but also addressed social , economic and cultural issues .  
Racism was , on the one hand , fear of the unknown a fear which , in extreme situations , could lead to racial cleansing in the desire to eliminate all differences and , on the other , a lack of curiosity , patience and understanding vis - - vis other people .  Yet cultures needed diversity to flourish , while racist behaviour stemmed from social pressure , assumptions and misconceptions .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world ,

Condemn all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related forms of intolerance concerning economic , social and cultural rights and other related matters , including access to employment , government benefits , access to capital , credit , technology , education and vocational training , housing , health care , the environment , cultural activities , the protection of heritage , equal access to public services and other types of services , and national immigration policies ;  
Express our conviction that political platforms based on racism , xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and discrimination must be condemned as incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance , and that racial discrimination condoned by governmental policies violates human rights and may endanger friendly relations among peoples , cooperation among nations , and international peace and security ;  
Underscore the need to promote strategies , programmes and policies , which may include measures of affirmative action , for furthering the fulfilment of civil and political rights for victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including through more effective access to the political , judicial and administrative functions of institutions , as well as the need to increase access to the administration of justice in all its forms , free from racial discrimination of any kind ;  
Recognize that education and lifelong learning are basic for the respect of the racial , ethnic , cultural , linguistic and religious diversity of our societies which is essential to prevent the spread of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and is of key importance for protecting and promoting democratic values ;  
Recognize the necessity of increasing appropriate preventive measures in order to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination , and the important role that international organizations , Governments , local authorities , the media , non-governmental organizations and civil society can play in developing such measures and building confidence between different racial and ethnic groups ;  
Urge States to adopt or strengthen , as appropriate , national programmes for eradicating poverty among indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , and also request that they expand their efforts to foster bilateral , regional and international cooperation in implementing those programmes ;  
Urge States to reaffirm their democratic commitment and take the necessary legislative , administrative and judicial measures , in accordance with their obligations under regional and international human rights instruments , to condemn and actively discourage all forms of propaganda , publicity , organizations , associations , political parties or groups inspired by ideas or theories of the superiority of one race or ethnic group and that seek to justify or promote racial hatred , xenophobia or racial discrimination ;

Request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation among States , and between them and international organizations for the purpose of concluding agreements , coordinating activities and developing programmes in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination ;  
Request the operational programmes and agencies of the United Nations , financial and development institutions , in accordance with their mandates , to assign higher priority and provide more funding to projects in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination , and to include such vulnerable groups at the stage of the development and implementation of projects concerning them ;  
Urge States to consider taking special measures to protect especially vulnerable persons and groups which may be subject to multiple forms of discrimination on account of their gender , age , national origin , sexual orientation , social or economic status , physical or mental disability , state of health , religious belief or any other condition liable to give rise to discrimination , including racial discrimination ;  
Also invite them to ensure their full enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in particular women , children and vulnerable groups , so that persons who admit to an HIV infection , those presumably infected and other persons affected are protected against violence , stigmatization , discrimination , unemployment and other negative consequences which may be compounded by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
Further request States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Also urge them to provide an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the different culture and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities have played in building national identities in the Americas , and historical and contemporary examples of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance directed against these groups ;  
Encourage all relevant actors to intensify their efforts at the national , regional and international levels , especially by means of education , to ensure that children are educated from an early age in those values , attitudes and ways of conduct and life that will allow them to resolve conflicts of a racial or ethnic character peacefully , in a spirit of respect for human dignity , tolerance and non-discrimination ;

Invite States to take appropriate constitutional , legislative and administrative measures , to foster equality among individuals , indigenous peoples , among people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities whose members are frequently victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and review existing measures with a view to amending or repealing national legislation and administrative provisions that may give rise to discrimination ;  
Request States to make a serious commitment to adopting more appropriate measures to ( a ) combat illegal acts motivated by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance against individuals , communities or groups of persons ; ( b ) protect victims of discrimination and provide them with security against future threats ; ( c ) punish those responsible for such crimes and violations of human rights ; and ( d ) make every effort to ensure that national and local public authorities act accordingly ;  
Urge States to give special attention , when promoting and implementing legislative and judicial policies designed to give workers adequate protection , to the serious situation of lack of protection and , in some cases , the exploitation or trafficking of victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , a situation that allows or facilitates confinement , as in the case of domestic workers and dangerous and badly paid jobs ;  
Urge States to design , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers who are victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and other related intolerance including , persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or be victims of illegal trafficking ;  
Urge the international community to take cognizance of the very real difficulties that peoples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds inevitably experience in seeking to live together and to develop genuine harmonious multiracial societies .  
Convinced of the fundamental importance of universal accession or ratification to and full implementation of [ the / our ] obligations arising under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as the principal international instrument to eliminate racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance [ based on race , color , descent , or national or ethnic origin ] ,  
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
PP8bis Reaffirming our commitment to combating all manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance on grounds of [ race , lineage , colour , religion , culture , language or national or ethnic origin * ] [ aggravated by forms of multiple discrimination based on reasons of age , gender , [ sexual orientation ] , physical and mental ability disability , or socio-economic status * ] ,  
The Commission also called for the condemnation of all forms of racism and racial discrimination , and for concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields , through improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services , in order to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights for all women and girls .  
In addition , under article 7 ( h ) , [ p ] ersecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law is also considered a crime against humanity .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
[ 10 ] After considering information in States parties reports concerning the ways in which individuals are identified as being members of a particular racial or ethnic group , the Committee stated that such identification should , if no justification existed to the contrary , be based upon self-identification by the individual concerned . 
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We recognize and admit that slavery and the slave trade , other forms of servitude , conquest and colonialism were the primary sources and manifestation / a source of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and condemn the injustices that were committed , especially against Africans , people of African descent and indigenous peoples and stress the need for all States which were engaged in such practices to acknowledge the grave human suffering they caused and the heinous racist acts committed ;  
We recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
We regret the existence of inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions in which intolerance and racial discrimination breed and fester , and we believe that genuine equality of opportunity for development is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .  
We also understand that discrimination contributes to inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions , and that genuine equality of opportunity [ for development ] is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We firmly believe that education , development and the faithful implementation of our international human rights norms / obligations , including enactment of laws and political , social and economic policies , are crucial to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We express deep concern about the use of new information technologies , such as the Internet , for purposes contrary to respect for human values , equality , non-discrimination , respect for others and tolerance , including to propagate racism , racial hatred , xenophobia , racial discrimination and related intolerance , and that children and youth have access to this material ; others / [ respect and tolerance for diversity ] ; [ and urge their continued and enhanced use in this respect ; ] .  
We reaffirm that the stigmatization of people of different origins by acts or omissions of public authorities , institutions , the media , political parties or national or local organizations is not only an act of racial discrimination but also an incitement to the recurrence of such acts , thereby resulting in the creation of a vicious circle which reinforces racist attitudes and prejudices ; such acts should be declared offences and crimes punishable by law ;  
We underline the essential contribution of independent specialized bodies at national , regional or local levels in promoting equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin or religious background ;  
We recognize that international and national exchange and dialogue [ among youth ] / [ at all levels , in particular educational institutions , religious authorities and youth associations ] , and the development of a global network among youth are important and fundamental elements in building intercultural understanding and respect and will contribute to the elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Urges States to design or reinforce , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies , as well as other preventive measures , against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers , including migrant workers , persons of migrant origin and foreign workers , who are vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or victims of illegal trafficking .  
Urges States [ to adopt and implement , or strengthen wherever necessary , national legislation and administrative measures that expressly and specifically counter racism and prohibit racial discrimination , whether direct or indirect , in all spheres of public life in conformity with the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination without making limiting reservations and to review existing measures with a view to amending or revising national legislation and administrative provisions that may give rise to discrimination ;

It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
It also urges them to provide the mainstream education with an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the individuals and groups from different cultures and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous people , people of African descent , Roma , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups and minorities have played in building national identifies ; 
Greater emphasis should be placed on teaching the history of national , racial , linguistic , cultural , religious and ethnic minorities [ and of the history of neighbouring countries ] with the aim of achieving mutual respect and understanding for others culture , religion or history / as well as of their contribution to the whole civil society ;  
Calls upon Calls uponStrongly recommends to participating States to introduce , or encourage the introduction of , or reinforce , human rights education , including promoting anti-racism , with a view to combating prejudices which lead to racial discrimination and to promoting understanding , tolerance and friendship between different racial or ethnic groups in school curricula and in institutions of higher education and to support public formal and non-formal education programmes designed to promote cultural diversity and self-esteem of vulnerable groups ;

STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE FULL AND EFFECTIVE EQUALITY ,  
Urges the international community to take cognizance of the very real difficulties that peoples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds inevitably experience in seeking to live together and to develop genuine harmonious multiracial societies .  
Furthermore it urges them to work in partnership at the national , regional and international levels to develop appropriate policy tools that facilitate the development of legislation , policies and programmes that take into account ethnic , racial , linguistic , religious and cultural diversity ;  
Recommends that the Commission on Human Rights prepare complementary international standards to strengthen and update international legislation against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including by drawing up an international code of ethics for communications media , especially the Internet , that includes specific measures to combat the unlawful dissemination of information that is racist , discriminatory , xenophobic or relating to intolerance ;  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;  
Noting that in its resolution 52 / 111 of 12 December 1997 , in which it decided to convene the World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , the General Assembly set as one of the main objectives of the Conference the review of the political , historical , social , cultural and other factors leading to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ,  
The General Assembly reaffirmed the responsibility of Governments to safeguard and protect the rights of migrants against illegal or violent acts , in particular acts of racial discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals or groups , and urged them to reinforce measures in that regard ; urged all States to adopt effective measures to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and detention of migrants , including by individuals or groups ; and called upon all States to protect the human rights of migrant children , in particular unaccompanied migrant children .  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;  
In other words , States that were previously in a position to ensure a legal regime of information exchange at their own internal level find themselves defenceless , in the new situation , against the transmission from abroad to their territory of information which may be unlawful or destructive , including pornography , disinformation , information indicative of racial discrimination or intolerance , information aimed at inciting social , national or religious hatred , information of a subversive nature or information emanating from and serving the interests of international criminal and terrorist groups .  
He noted with regret that despite all the collective commitments made by heads of State and Government at the various international conferences held over the past decade and in the Millennium Declaration particularly with regard to social development and poverty eradication , national , regional and international challenges to the fulfilment of those commitments , such as armed and civil racial conflicts , genocide , enforced displacement , the proliferation of drugs , organized crime and terrorism against innocent persons were increasing in an unprecedented manner .  
However , over a-billion people had continued to live in extreme poverty , with millions of people unemployed , and a growing number of societies breaking up along racial , ethnic or social fault lines .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Therefore , the delegations of Ecuador , Brazil , Chile , Canada and Guatemala reaffirm the importance for the strengthening and advancement of human rights and the combat of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , of developing , implementing and improving specific policies and programmes to address effectively a serious form of multiple discrimination , which occurs when racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance intersect with discrimination based on sexual orientation .  
The World Conference should acknowledge that differences in ethnic identities have long manifested themselves in diverse ways , but should recognize that the racism of the colonial era constituted an unprecedented system of thought and action that has a specific historical origin in the transatlantic slave trade and the consequent development of the global racial chattel enslavement of Africans .  
States are invited to compile and publish statistical data broken down by racial and ethnic groups in the areas of health , system of criminal justice , housing , education and employment , with a view to determining whether policies or programmes are having a disproportionate impact on such groups , and to take supplementary measures , when drawing up and evaluating individual policies and programmes , in order to remedy such impact ;

Recognize that sexual violence during armed conflict constituting serious violations of international humanitarian law has been used as a tool of systematic forms of discrimination , abuse and genocide directed against racial or ethnic populations of non-combatants , and that race and gender combine to make women particularly vulnerable to certain types of violence , particularly sexual violence ;  
Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in paragraph 3 , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law , in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court ;  
To develop policies and action plans , and to reinforce and implement preventive measures , to foster greater harmony and tolerance between migrant workers and host societies with the aim of eliminating the growing manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including acts of violence , perpetrated in many societies by individuals or groups and directed towards migrant workers and their families , persons of migrant origin and resident foreign workers ;  
Effective legal and judicial cooperation at the regional and international levels in combating acts of racism , [ anti-Semitism ] , racial discrimination , and xenophobia and related intolerance to prevent the perpetrators of racist and xenophobic these acts from benefiting from the fact that offences are treated differently in various States ;  
Include in their regular reporting to their boards of governors information on their contributions to promoting the participation of people of African descent , indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups within their organizations , and information on their efforts to facilitate the participation of racial , ethnic , religious , cultural and other minorities in the economic , social , political and cultural life of their countries ;  
To work with health-care professionals , community-based health providers , non-governmental organizations , scientific researchers and private industry as a means of improving the health status of marginalized communities , in particular victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; bis To work with health professionals , scientific researchers and international and regional health organizations to study the differential impacts of medical treatments and health strategies on various communities ;
