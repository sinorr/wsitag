Cultural and sports activists among the masses should be given ideological education and vocational training , and the more outstanding ones should be selected to serve as instructors for community cultural and sports activities in order to gradually bring these activities onto the track of organized , standardized and healthy development .  
Have personal quality education permeate all such stages as preschool education , elementary and secondary school education , vocational education , adult education , and higher education as well as all categories of education , and all such aspects as school education , family education , and social education , so that the different stages and aspects have different contents and emphases but are also closely linked to each other and in mutual cooperation , advancing as an integral whole .  
It is necessary to adhere to the principle of doing ideological and political work and doing economic and vocational work at the same time .  Ideological and educational work should permeate practical work , and the actual results in ideological and political work should be increased .  
As we have deepened the educational structural reform and promoted the quality education in a comprehensive way , distinctive features are formed in moral education , foreign language , computer science , special education , and advanced vocational education .  
The state is obliged to adopt effective steps to guarantee the realization of these rights , for example , providing technical and vocational guidance and training , ensuring men and women enjoy equal pay for equal work , guarantee industrial safety and public sanitation in the working environment , ensuring that people in the same trades enjoy equal chances for promotion and such promotion will only be determined by seniority and ability , and will not be affected by any other factors .  
Liu Huadi : In the 50 years since its peaceful liberation , Tibet has witnessed a fast development in its education undertakings .  It now has a fairly complete modern educational system encompassing primary education , adult education , vocational and technical education and special education from primary school to university level .  
The General Office of the NPC Standing Committee began offering systematic training to NPC cadres at various levels in 1989 in order to meet the needs of the NPC 's work and make the training of NPC cadres a regular , institutionalized and standard practice .  More than 8,000 cadres have been trained to date .  This has given great impetus to the political , ideological and theoretical development of the ranks of NPC cadres and improved their vocational quality , and is an important contribution to the work of the NPC in the new period .  
Between 15 and 20 June , in the company of Zhang Dejiang , secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee , and Chai Songyue , governor of Zhejiang Province , Li Lanqing mainly inspected basic education , vocational education , higher education , and scientific research in Wenzhou , Ningbo , Shaoxing , and Hangzhou . He also held meetings with representatives of the educational circles to discuss issues on deepening educational reforms , comprehensively advancing quality education , orienting education to serving local economic and social development .  
Some standing committee members stated that it is justified to set higher requirements on the academic qualifications of judges and procurators .  However , the quality of judges and procurators should not be reflected in their academic qualifications alone .  Examination only reveals professional standards , whereas other factors , such as political integrity and vocational ethics , can only be assessed by practical work .  
As far as the work of financial departments is concerned , this means the necessity of developing good vocational ethics , establishing the spirit of loving one 's work and the spirit of selfless dedication , establishing the spirit of scrupulously abiding by one 's duty and daring to undertake responsibility , establishing the spirit of doing arduous work , being honest , and exercising self-discipline , and establishing the spirit of handling affairs according to rules and regulations and observing laws and discipline .  
The " Opinions " demands : We should build a vocational education network on the foundation of existing township and town regular and technical schools and rural applied techniques popularization stations .  In economically comparatively backward regions , we should strive to make junior middle-school graduates generally have one or two job skills that can help them become better off .  
The " Opinions " points out : All localities should strive to explore a way of developing vocational schools that conform to the characteristics of minority nationalities and ethnic minority regions , in consideration of local conditions and the current level of economic and educational development of the minority nationalities and the ethnic minority regions .  
A policy of " relaxed admission and strict graduation " should be applied in such disciplines as agriculture , forestry and animal husbandry of secondary vocational schools ; junior middle-school graduates with diplomas may be admitted to these disciplines without age limit and without having to pass an entrance examination ; and after they complete their studies and pass an examination , they will be issued a secondary vocational school diploma .  
The " Opinions " demands that while maintaining an equal level of fund appropriation between vocational schools and regular schools , all localities should gradually increase the appropriation to the former year by year ; that a proper proportion of the subsidies for urban and rural vocational education appropriated by the central government to various provinces and autonomous regions should be used exclusively in the vocational education for minority nationalities and in ethnic minority regions ;  
As a people 's court is an important judicial organ , it needs profound theoretical knowledge and qualified personnel who are capable of making correct use of the theory and vocational knowledge that they master in the practice of administration of justice .  
Zeng Qinghong demanded that the party central committee 's important instructions on improving the cadres ' healthcare work should be resolutely and genuinely put into practice , and that efforts should be made to perform the following work effectively : 1 ) Stepping up building the rank of cadres and training a number of middle-aged and young healthcare personnel who are strong in political awareness , proficient in vocational work , and upright in work style .  
The local people 's governments at all levels should adopt preferential policies for , offer financial support to , and step up supervision and management of the work of vocational education and training for demobilized servicemen and may also accept and settle in a planned way and in light of the needs of developing the western regions on a large scale some outstanding professional personnel among demobilized servicemen in the western regions . 
Article 16 The scales of unemployment insurance money and unemployment insurance benefits including medical subsidy , funeral subsidy , pension , and allowances for vocational training and employment agency services shall be implemented in accordance with relevant provisions of individual provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments .  
To improve the quality of workers and provide effective human resources support for the sustained and fast development of the national economy is a strategic task for the labor security cause .  Zhang Zuoji said : For some time to come , it is necessary to regard the vocational qualification certificate system as the point of breakthrough for the improvement of the quality of workers and popularize the vocational qualification certificate system in a comprehensive way .  
It is necessary to place education in a dominant position conscientiously , lay special emphasis on intensifying elementary education , increase the intensity of the central finance 's support to compulsory education in the impoverished areas , positively develop vocational education , and train qualified personnel needed for the local economic and social development .  
I hope that you would treasure your duty and mission , cultivate a strong enterprising spirit and sense of responsibility , and devote your thoughts and energies to the successful running of the broadcasting industry .  You should learn , learn and learn again , penetrate , penetrate and penetrate still deeper .  You should draw wisdom and nourishments from the fervent activities of reform and construction and from the practice of the masses in creating a beautiful future in order to improve your political quality , spiritual outlook and vocational level .  
We should continue to increase investment in education , ensure the basic need in promoting compulsory education in rural areas , support the construction of foundation facilities for schools of higher learning , develop middle and high level professional education , strengthen vocational and technical training , and encourage people in the society to run schools .  
Other chapters in the handbook are also updated on HAD service , immigration , social welfare , education , employment , vocational training , public housing , medical care , family planning , transport , recreational and cultural venues , postal services , legal aid , consumers ' rights , corruption prevention , emergency services , and a list of NGOs providing services for new arrivals .  
Also , participating training bodies are ready to provide an extensive range of vocational training opportunities for skills upgrading , " the spokesman said .  " Members of the public should make use of this invaluable occasion to keep track of the most up-to-date careers opportunities so as to prepare themselves for the challenges ahead in the increasingly competitive world of work . "  
The handbook contains information on HAD 's services , immigration , social welfare , education , employment , vocational training , public housing , medical care , family planning , transport , recreational and cultural venues , postal services , legal aid , consumer rights , social order , corruption prevention , emergency services , environmental protection , The Ombudsman , Pedestrian Code , protection of intellectual property and a list of non-governmental organisations providing services for new arrivals .  
The Competition is divided into two categories .  Category A is for full-time senior secondary students ( From 4 to 7 ) nominated by the secondary schools of those participants attended .  Category B is for full-time post-secondary students from local universities , colleges and institutes of vocational education , etc .  Entries can be submitted by individual or in teams consisting up to four members from the same school .  
Thus , subjects of academic , practical , vocational and integrated nature will be included in the curriculum to meet the different personal and vocational needs of students as well as the social , economic and technological demands of Hong Kong 's development .  
A draft Vocational Training Law completed by the Ministry of Interior to cope with the national economic and social developments is a start . Its aim is to obtain more skilled laborers , to provide full employment and to set up a permanent vocational training system . The vocational training program is being given top priority in the Six-Year Economic Development Plan .  
The Central Taiwan Vocational Training Center , the southern and northern Taiwan vocational training centers operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the Taishan vocational training center operated by the Ministry of the Interior , the first youth vocational training center run by the National Youth Commission , the northern provincial vocational training center , Taipei municipal vocational training center , eastern Taiwan vocational training center , and a vocational training center for retired servicemen .  
Their eldest son Che-ho turned 17 this year . Ever since he entered the equivalent of tenth grade in his vocational high school-cum-junior college , parents Chung Chiang-shan and Chang Pi-yun have seen their son pulled between what he 's been taught at home , on the one hand , and peer pressures and the lures of modern society on the other . Che-ho started asking if he could stay out until late at night . He dyed his hair , made repeated pleas for a pager and secretly brought his girlfriend home .  
In the blueprint drawn up by the Ministry of Education , because vocational high schools will be exam-free , students below 18 years of age will experience the opportunity to make an independent choice . Whether they want to go to high school and then to university , or to go the way of vocational education , their direction will be determined in advance , so the number of candidates sitting for the university joint entrance examination will probably be smaller than it is today .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
This second limitation means that some 2.6 million " workers with no fixed employer " and self-employed people will be excluded from the unemployment insurance system . Their loss will be compensated by their being excused from paying the 1% of Labor Insurance contributions earmarked for unemployment insurance , and they will continue to be eligible for the existing assistance such as vocational training and new-job bonuses and loans . CLA chairman Chan Huo-sheng also promises that in the future , unemployment insurance will be gradually extended to cover these workers .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education . "  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
It required " a grade one vocational qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a junior college of that time ] and a grade two academic qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a three-year technical high school of that time ] . Preparing for the test was difficult . Days were hard after you went to work too , both in the training period and when you actually were working . If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students . The result is that the schools in the middle end up getting overloaded .  
According to Gu Weiqin , another relative involved with the running of Mingda , " The only advantage for Mingda was that Yangzhou University had been around for a long time and had a very good reputation . A diploma from Yangzhou University carried considerable cachet , and was more attractive to students . A graduate from the Chinese Department of Fudan University in Shanghai , Gu Weiqin is a former department head at a vocational school in Nanchang , capital of Jiangxi Province .  
From the 1970s to the beginning of 1990s , entrance to these schools was fixed at a ratio of 30:70 . No matter how strong the desire of students to continue toward university , seven out of every ten were forced out of the university track and into the vocational track right after leaving junior high ( i.e . just before their tenth year in school ) . These have been the real victims left on the school advancement battlefield .  
Since 1991 more than 100 new public and private high schools ( including comprehensive high schools ) have been founded , so now there are more than 270 such institutions . Meanwhile , the ratio of students entering academic vs . vocational tracks has been adjusted to 45:55 . This means that today more than 40% of kids can keep their university dream alive after junior high school .  
Lin was born in 1959 in Taitung County 's Kuanshan . After graduating from junior high school , Lin 's father hoped that he would study at a vocational school and develop an occupational skill . However , Lin 's heart was set on going to senior high school and then to university . The father and son clashed and the result was that Lin attended neither vocational school nor high school ; he left home and headed for Taipei instead .  
" I graduated second to last of my whole elementary school , " Lu explains . " My sister was my homeroom teacher during my first year in junior high . She felt that I learned too slowly , so she had me sent to the special education class . It took me four years to graduate from middle school , and because I could n't pass the high school entrance exam , I went to vocational school .  
Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education . The technical and vocational education infrastructure has undergone major changes over the last few years . Vocational high schools have been reduced in scale and become increasingly unclear about their role , while senior technical colleges have begun to resemble standard universities , with many actually choosing to upgrade to university status . With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
Although the rapid expansion of senior technical and vocational education has been able to meet student demand for degrees , another problem has arisen . With the rapid transformation of Taiwan 's industrial structure , there has been an increase in demand for individuals with specific skills . Vocational education now faces the problem of providing people with skills for which there is insufficient market demand . Supply and demand imbalance  
With falling student numbers and faced with apparent apathy , technical and vocational colleges have been forced to adjust their developmental goals in order to survive , and this has thrown the entire system into crisis .  
Chang Tien-fu says : " Schools chose to focus on transforming themselves and in the process forgot their own position and character . " Although many schools did change their name , their relative position in the educational hierarchy was not improved . On the contrary , having reorganized themselves many technical and vocational schools began to turn their back on earlier achievements . In other words , they stopped focusing on the need for practical work and started to emphasize theory and R &amp; D .  
It is a great pity , but as the number of graduation credits required to graduate from the vocational system has declined over the years , and with no rules indicating the minimum number of credits to be earned from practical work , related classes have come under pressure . As a result , many private schools have chosen to cut subjects that involve physical work or extra financing , which ensures students are given fewer and fewer opportunities to familiarize themselves with actual physical operations .  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
Wen Shih-jen , deputy CEO of computer manufacturer Inventec , has likened the importance of cooperation between technical and vocational education and industry to laying the " last mile " in establishing the Internet : " The final section needed to ensure the Internet is linked with actual users is known as the ' last mile . ' Without this section users would be unable to get online and the Internet would be a wasted opportunity . "  
In point of fact , the development of technical and vocational education can not be considered in isolation from the motivations of broader education policy . At a time when standard universities and colleges seem unsure of their own development and are establishing an increasing number of money-making , functional departments , they have begun to impinge on a market formerly considered the preserve of vocational schools . Little wonder then that concerns have been voiced that measures introduced by the Ministry of Education will gradually result in the collapse of technical and vocational education .  
As a result some schools were able to establish strategic alliances with both public and independent junior high schools and with industry in Malaysia . As well as providing scholarships to encourage students to study in Taiwan , vocational colleges will in future also allow teachers to visit Malaysia to engage in cooperative programs with local firms to assist them in enhancing their technology .  
Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree . And though Taiwan 's licensing system is not yet fully developed , Yu-Da Institute still requires that students get at least two licenses in order to graduate . People studying data processing , for example , have to get a Class C computer technician license and pass the General English Proficiency Test .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
Chen Chin-chin , principal of Taichung Industrial High School , feels the technical and vocational education system , an alternative to the usual route through high school and then college and sometimes referred to as the " second track , " was very difficult to set up in the first place and that it is an integral part of the nation 's wellbeing . So , how can one talk lightly about abolishing it ?  
In addition to technical and vocational students continuing on in education in large numbers and thus leading to the withering away of the " inherently " inferior " second track , " the lack of official expenditures in this area have amounted to " kicking a man when he is down , " and the gap between the two national educational " tracks " has widened significantly .  
Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
Some people say straight out that the comprehensive high school can only attract students of middling ability . Requiring these students to study with a dual orientation and to " explore " multiple areas causes them to fall even further behind their senior high school counterparts in the general curriculum . Added to this , they are not as good as vocational high school students in technical subjects-so they end up " losing out at both ends . "  
The Ministry of Education plans call for the current seven types of vocational high schools with their 70 different courses to develop in different directions . Navigation and nursing courses , for example , will be raised to the technical college level , equivalent to higher education . Some industry sectors will be adjusted to the post-technical college level , commerce and home economics will primarily train people for the service industry , and responding to Taiwan 's entry into WTO , agricultural studies will develop in the direction of specialized agricultural education .  
From a cross-sectional perspective , reform has included changes in the core curriculum , a freeing up of the types of instructional materials used , and a variety of assessment methods , admissions , and approaches to teacher training . From a vertical perspective , reform has included the widespread establishment of new high schools and universities , the localization of normal and vocational high schools , policies regarding independent study in junior high schools , basic education testing , the promotion of English in elementary schools , and native-language instruction .  
ILO continued to provide technical advisory service to a number of OAU-sponsored regional and subregional institutions concerned with vocational rehabilitation and training , occupational safety and health , and migration and social security .  
Provide scientific data and training , stressing the interdisciplinary approach to problem solving in national specific issues and strengthen the development of environmental education programmes as part of basic , higher , technical and vocational education ;  
Assistance to human resources development totalled US $ 56 million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
The Revolutionary Youth Movement to which the youth of Syria belong is an organizational framework and an educational forum for young people through which Syria 's youth exercise their its democratic rights , elect their political leaderships , practice their hobbies and defend their interests at all levels : the educational , social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic , artistic , informational , ideological , political and technical .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , could establish or enhance vocational and technical training relevant to current and prospective employment conditions .  
Ensure access for all youth to all types of education , wherever appropriate , providing alternative learning structures , ensure that education reflects the economic and social needs of youth and incorporates the concepts of environmental awareness and sustainable development throughout the curricula ; and expand vocational training , implementing innovative methods aimed at increasing practical skills , such as environmental scouting ;  
The Fund will thus actively advocate a holistic approach to empowering women , integrating efforts to improve women 's health , literacy and education , both formal and vocational , with wider efforts to reduce social , legal , cultural and economic disparities based on gender .  
In this context , my Government wishes to emphasize the need for the quick deployment of UNAVEM III , because it alone as we all know will bear responsibility for the quartering , disarming and selection of UNITA troops that are to be integrated into the unified national army of Angola and for the demobilization of the excess military personnel that will be reintegrated into civilian life after receiving vocational training .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , should enhance the relevance of vocational and technical training to both current and prospective employment conditions by applying a broad and flexible approach to human resources development for youth that fosters the capacity of skilled labour to adjust to changes in labour demand .  
Ensure universal and equal access to and completion of primary education by all children and eliminate the existing gap between girls and boys , as stipulated in article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ; 10 / similarly , ensure equal access to secondary education by the year 2005 and equal access to higher education , including vocational and technical education , for all girls and boys , including the disadvantaged and gifted ; 
Other obstacles to the development of businesses owned by women include an adverse economic and regulatory environment , inadequate physical infrastructure and marketing , poor access to new technology , and a lack of vocational and managerial training .  Rigid social and cultural norms and lack of sharing of domestic responsibilities exacerbate the problems women face when operating businesses .

would therefore be advisable to allocate increased resources to basic educational and vocational training , which were essential elements in promoting the economic development of the least developed countries .  
They also include improving public health , with emphasis on prevention and service for the most vulnerable groups especially children including planning , organizing and financing local health services ; improving basic public education , with emphasis on reducing illiteracy and on vocational training , with community participation , improved educational infrastructure , the promotion of culture and so on ; and the improvement of living conditions , physical planning and local infrastructure  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .  
While in the beginning of this partnership large amounts had to be contributed towards emergency measures , today the extensive bilateral development cooperation focuses mainly on the consolidation of structural adaptation processes , the rehabilitation of social infrastructures , the promotion of private enterprises ( including vocational training ) , agricultural development , and the protection of the environment and natural resources .

To that end , the Ministry of State responsible for women 's status and problems , in cooperation with other State agencies , had undertaken the collection of gender-based statistics , developed programmes of vocational and technical education for girls and a policy of credit for women entrepreneurs , incorporated women 's human rights in the curricula of human rights education in secondary schools , launched public awareness campaigns and developed measures to eliminate violence against women .  
ILO aimed , in the context of technical programmes implemented at the national level , to give women the means to play a more active economic role by organizing vocational training courses for them in areas traditionally reserved for men , by proposing various measures to develop their entrepreneurship and by organizing workshops to teach them to organize themselves better vis - - vis their employers and to negotiate better working conditions .  
The consequences of substance use are diverse , including acute and chronic health problems , disruption to interpersonal relationships ( particularly within families ) , social marginalization , criminal behaviour , school failure , vocational problems and failure to achieve normal adolescent milestones .  
Admission to general or vocational upper secondary education - which traditionally prepares students for higher education - is subject to a statement issued by their earlier school confirming that they are qualified for studies at this level .  
In addition it appears that occupational and educational counselling is available to all citizens in Greenland , that the counselling is free of charge , and that it is provided by municipal labour market offices , municipal or regional vocational guidance officers , institutions of primary and lower secondary education and institutions of vocational training .  
The order covers basic , decentralized vocational training and education in Greenland in the following main areas : metalworking ; construction ; commercial and clerical trades ; food trades ; fisheries ; social services ; health services ; graphic trades ; service trades .  
First , with respect to educational and vocational training measures , the Act provides that " education and re-education shall , as far as is possible , take place in ordinary educational establishments , or , failing that , in specialized establishments " ( art . 10 ) ; and lays down the general rule that " vocational training of the disabled must give them the capacity to exercise an economic activity enabling them to use their vocational skills and aptitudes " ( art .  11 ) .  
A large number of public and private institutions are responsible , depending on the cultural or artistic speciality in question , for ensuring academic or vocational and practical training .  
To make educational and vocational information and guidance available and accessible to all children , indicating , inter alia , the forms of such information and guidance , the mechanisms used to assess their effectiveness , the budget allocated for that purpose , as well as any relevant disaggregated data , including by age , gender , region , urban / rural area , and social and ethnic origin ;  
Reports should also identify , inter alia , the mechanisms established and the programmes and activities developed for that purpose , as well as the education and vocational training provided , and indicate relevant disaggregated data on the children concerned , including by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , and social and ethnic origin .  
Any preventive and remedial action undertaken , including information and awareness campaigns , as well as education , in particular compulsory education , and vocational training programmes , to address the situation of child labour both in the formal and informal sector , including as domestic servants , in agriculture or within private family activities ;  
Schools , universities , professional and vocational training programmes and institutions should be encouraged and assisted in developing human rights curricula and corresponding teaching and resource materials , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes , for incorporation into formal education at the early childhood , primary , secondary , post-secondary and adult education levels .  
With the support of national focal points and national resource and training centres , local and community-based organizations should be prepared to deliver popular human rights education , through vocational and adult education , literacy training , local non-governmental organizations , family outreach and religious education .  
Moreover , pursuant to article 6 [ 27 ] of this Act , any clause of any contract , regulation or statute that is contrary to the principle of equal treatment of men and women in respect of access to employment , advancement , vocational guidance , training , refresher courses and retraining , or access to an independent profession and conditions of work shall automatically be invalid . 
Women having no vocational qualification can participate while in training on the job ; the training includes an introductory course comprising a minimum of 30 hours training and a more advanced course comprising at least 30 hours of theory and technical training , 30 hours of practising what they have learned , under supervision , and 40 hours of practical training outside the Fondation ; their performance is evaluated on a continuing basis .  
In order to provide enterprises with incentives to adopt innovative measures to promote female employment , a special award was established in 1993 at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour and Employment to reward those enterprises which have taken action to increase the participation of women in the labour force , improve the quality of female employment , develop their potential , including through the strengthening of programmes to provide education and vocational training , and eliminate or counteract the negative consequences in women 's work .  
That training is implemented in cooperation with the five education development centres , one in each Field , and covers a wide range of courses of one - , two - or three-year duration aimed at certifying unqualified elementary and preparatory teachers or vocational training instructors , meeting curricular changes and developing the supervisory and leadership skills of senior education staff .  
The number of such associations is constantly rising , and their diverse objectives include childcare , encouraging the work and education of women , raising women 's awareness of educational , health , social and legal matters and providing vocational training for women in skills such as dressmaking , printing and domestic food preparation .  
This youth policy is coordinated on an inter-ministerial basis and involves two major non-governmental organizations : the National Union of Syrian Students ( with a membership composed of students in universities , postgraduate studies and higher and intermediate institutes ) and the Revolutionary Youth Union ( with a membership of over 1.5-million composed of young workers , rural youth , students with both political and non-political backgrounds , including social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic and artistic . 
Traditional cultural , social and religious values and practices had reinforced the lower status which society accorded to women and had restricted their opportunities for education , technical and vocational training and employment , thereby limiting their participation in the overall development process .  
In Liechtenstein , non-governmental organizations would continue to play a critical role in that process , which would focus , in particular , on motivating women to participate in national political life ; providing academic and vocational guidance for adolescent girls ; facilitating the compatibility of women 's professional and family life , and building public awareness about the problem of violence against women and children .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .  
One of UNESCOs major thrusts for contributing to development is directed towards renewing and diversifying technical and vocational education , so as to prepare young women and men as adults for the world of work and for responsible civic life .  
In order to prepare young people for the world of work , students 14 years of age or older from general education schools , vocational training schools or specialized secondary institutions may , with the consent of a parent or person acting in loco parentis , be recruited for light free _ time work which is not detrimental to their health and does not interfere with their studies .  
The creation of the necessary social and economic conditions for free basic , vocational and , on the basis of competitive access , complete secondary and higher education at State educational establishments within the limits of State educational standards ;  
Crucial requirements are well known and include improving the access to and quality of primary , secondary , technical and vocational education ; improving marketing arrangements for primary commodities ; land reform ; mobilization of domestic saving for infrastructure including small scale , local public works and for private investment ; and attracting foreign direct investment under conditions that ensure benefits to the receiving countries .  
The elimination of child labour required a comprehensive approach that addressed the conditions of poverty which caused and perpetuated the practice , and included solutions such as rehabilitation , alternative and remunerative employment for parents , the enforcement of legislative and administrative measures , and education and vocational training .  
In Mexico , the Edusat network has 24,000 signal receivers installed at various educational centres , covering pre-school , primary , lower and upper secondary , technical , vocational , further , adult and continuing education and in-service training , for the benefit of children , young persons , parents and teaching staff .  
In 1982 , the Basic People 's Congresses ( the legislative mechanism ) approved the new educational structure with a view to redesigning the educational system by introducing technical and artistic education linked with vocational training at the basic and intermediate stages , the aim being to meet the needs of the national economy for a workforce with technical and vocational qualifications .  
Furthermore , the relations between ILO and the concerned OIC institutions were strengthened through the exchange of information on issues of mutual interest , including the promotion of employment , enhancement of the performance of the national economies in the region , poverty alleviation , social security , empowerment of women in rural areas , combating child labour , enhancement of vocational training , vocational rehabilitation and enhancement of occupational safety and health .  
Basic education , health , vocational training , secondary and tertiary education , lifelong upgrading of skills and knowledge and support for the development of innovative thinking are crucial to technical progress .  
Services were provided in medical rehabilitation ; education ; training and retraining ; vocational assessment and guidance ; placement in employment in the open market , sheltered employment , self-employment and supported employment ; provision of technical aids ; removal of social and physical barriers ; provision of allowances ; and financial assistance to disabled persons for purchasing their own homes .  
Successful elements of those strategies included increasing penetration of external markets ; facilitating access to imported inputs ; creating an enabling environment ; improving universal primary education and access to secondary , vocational and higher education , with emphasis on science and technology ; promoting entrepreneurship and enhancing the competence of the civil service .  
The objectives were to achieve nutritional coverage of the most vulnerable sector , reduce maternal and infant mortality , and ensure the supply of clean drinking water ; eliminate female illiteracy in rural areas and provide vocational training in urban areas , and educate women about their rights ; and reduce poverty , provide small loans to womens rural cooperatives , and increase employment .  
Strongly condemns all forms of racial discrimination and xenophobia as regards access to employment , vocational training , housing , schooling , health services and social services , as well as services intended for use by the public , and welcomes the active role played by governmental and non-governmental organizations in combating racism and assisting individual victims of racist acts , including migrant victims ;  
Turning to the issue of human resources development , he said that ILO considered that there was an urgent need to set in place active labour market policies to help workers cope with the growing problems of job loss and redeployment .  Training and re-training programmes , job search assistance , vocational counselling and access to good labour market information were all essential .  
Strongly condemns all forms of racial discrimination and xenophobia with regard to access to employment , vocational training , housing , schooling , health services and social services , as well as services intended for use by the public , and welcomes the active role played by governmental and non-governmental organizations in combating racism and assisting individual victims of racist acts , including migrant victims ;  
Plans will also include the design and implementation of a national policy specifically directed towards youth to promote technical and vocational training , recreational and cultural facilities and the fostering of moral and civic values that will enable them to take an active part in Salvadoran society .  
Other elements relate mostly to building and enhancing capacities such as universal primary education , wide access to secondary , vocational and higher education , with emphasis on science and technology , entrepreneurship development , particularly for small and medium-scale enterprises , and building a competent civil service , including the provision of adequate incentives .  
The Committee is further concerned at the limited access of children with disabilities to formal or vocational educational opportunities and at the proportionally low number of girls attending primary or secondary school .  
A report on the Plan of Action had analysed results in 12 areas , including obstacles faced and lessons learned , among them the unwillingness of certain parents to permit their daughters to have vocational or technical training ; the policy of privatizing of health services , which prevents early detection of disease ; the lack of proper records on violence against women ; strong patriarchal attitudes in society ; and the limited access to financial resources that impedes women from running for elected office .  
It was noted that international development cooperation has a decisive role to play in enhancing the trade competitiveness of developing countries through the development , transfer and assimilation of technology ; promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises ; strengthening of financial systems ; development of highly qualified human resources ; and improvement of public school systems , especially in the areas of formal and non-formal vocational training . 
Condemn all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related forms of intolerance concerning economic , social and cultural rights and other related matters , including access to employment , government benefits , access to capital , credit , technology , education and vocational training , housing , health care , the environment , cultural activities , the protection of heritage , equal access to public services and other types of services , and national immigration policies ;  
Ensure access for all youth to all types of education , wherever appropriate , providing alternative learning structures , ensure that education reflects the economic and social needs of youth and incorporates the concepts of environmental awareness and sustainable development throughout the curricula ; and expand vocational training , implementing innovative methods aimed at increasing practical skills , such as environmental scouting ( para .  25.9 ( d ) ) ;  
Cultural and sports activists among the masses should be given ideological education and vocational training , and the more outstanding ones should be selected to serve as instructors for community cultural and sports activities in order to gradually bring these activities onto the track of organized , standardized and healthy development .  
Have personal quality education permeate all such stages as preschool education , elementary and secondary school education , vocational education , adult education , and higher education as well as all categories of education , and all such aspects as school education , family education , and social education , so that the different stages and aspects have different contents and emphases but are also closely linked to each other and in mutual cooperation , advancing as an integral whole .  
It is necessary to adhere to the principle of doing ideological and political work and doing economic and vocational work at the same time .  Ideological and educational work should permeate practical work , and the actual results in ideological and political work should be increased .  
As we have deepened the educational structural reform and promoted the quality education in a comprehensive way , distinctive features are formed in moral education , foreign language , computer science , special education , and advanced vocational education .  
The state is obliged to adopt effective steps to guarantee the realization of these rights , for example , providing technical and vocational guidance and training , ensuring men and women enjoy equal pay for equal work , guarantee industrial safety and public sanitation in the working environment , ensuring that people in the same trades enjoy equal chances for promotion and such promotion will only be determined by seniority and ability , and will not be affected by any other factors .  
Liu Huadi : In the 50 years since its peaceful liberation , Tibet has witnessed a fast development in its education undertakings .  It now has a fairly complete modern educational system encompassing primary education , adult education , vocational and technical education and special education from primary school to university level .  
The General Office of the NPC Standing Committee began offering systematic training to NPC cadres at various levels in 1989 in order to meet the needs of the NPC 's work and make the training of NPC cadres a regular , institutionalized and standard practice .  More than 8,000 cadres have been trained to date .  This has given great impetus to the political , ideological and theoretical development of the ranks of NPC cadres and improved their vocational quality , and is an important contribution to the work of the NPC in the new period .  
Between 15 and 20 June , in the company of Zhang Dejiang , secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee , and Chai Songyue , governor of Zhejiang Province , Li Lanqing mainly inspected basic education , vocational education , higher education , and scientific research in Wenzhou , Ningbo , Shaoxing , and Hangzhou . He also held meetings with representatives of the educational circles to discuss issues on deepening educational reforms , comprehensively advancing quality education , orienting education to serving local economic and social development .  
Some standing committee members stated that it is justified to set higher requirements on the academic qualifications of judges and procurators .  However , the quality of judges and procurators should not be reflected in their academic qualifications alone .  Examination only reveals professional standards , whereas other factors , such as political integrity and vocational ethics , can only be assessed by practical work .  
As far as the work of financial departments is concerned , this means the necessity of developing good vocational ethics , establishing the spirit of loving one 's work and the spirit of selfless dedication , establishing the spirit of scrupulously abiding by one 's duty and daring to undertake responsibility , establishing the spirit of doing arduous work , being honest , and exercising self-discipline , and establishing the spirit of handling affairs according to rules and regulations and observing laws and discipline .  
The " Opinions " demands : We should build a vocational education network on the foundation of existing township and town regular and technical schools and rural applied techniques popularization stations .  In economically comparatively backward regions , we should strive to make junior middle-school graduates generally have one or two job skills that can help them become better off .  
The " Opinions " points out : All localities should strive to explore a way of developing vocational schools that conform to the characteristics of minority nationalities and ethnic minority regions , in consideration of local conditions and the current level of economic and educational development of the minority nationalities and the ethnic minority regions .  
A policy of " relaxed admission and strict graduation " should be applied in such disciplines as agriculture , forestry and animal husbandry of secondary vocational schools ; junior middle-school graduates with diplomas may be admitted to these disciplines without age limit and without having to pass an entrance examination ; and after they complete their studies and pass an examination , they will be issued a secondary vocational school diploma .  
The " Opinions " demands that while maintaining an equal level of fund appropriation between vocational schools and regular schools , all localities should gradually increase the appropriation to the former year by year ; that a proper proportion of the subsidies for urban and rural vocational education appropriated by the central government to various provinces and autonomous regions should be used exclusively in the vocational education for minority nationalities and in ethnic minority regions ;  
As a people 's court is an important judicial organ , it needs profound theoretical knowledge and qualified personnel who are capable of making correct use of the theory and vocational knowledge that they master in the practice of administration of justice .  
Zeng Qinghong demanded that the party central committee 's important instructions on improving the cadres ' healthcare work should be resolutely and genuinely put into practice , and that efforts should be made to perform the following work effectively : 1 ) Stepping up building the rank of cadres and training a number of middle-aged and young healthcare personnel who are strong in political awareness , proficient in vocational work , and upright in work style .  
The local people 's governments at all levels should adopt preferential policies for , offer financial support to , and step up supervision and management of the work of vocational education and training for demobilized servicemen and may also accept and settle in a planned way and in light of the needs of developing the western regions on a large scale some outstanding professional personnel among demobilized servicemen in the western regions . 
Article 16 The scales of unemployment insurance money and unemployment insurance benefits including medical subsidy , funeral subsidy , pension , and allowances for vocational training and employment agency services shall be implemented in accordance with relevant provisions of individual provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments .  
To improve the quality of workers and provide effective human resources support for the sustained and fast development of the national economy is a strategic task for the labor security cause .  Zhang Zuoji said : For some time to come , it is necessary to regard the vocational qualification certificate system as the point of breakthrough for the improvement of the quality of workers and popularize the vocational qualification certificate system in a comprehensive way .  
It is necessary to place education in a dominant position conscientiously , lay special emphasis on intensifying elementary education , increase the intensity of the central finance 's support to compulsory education in the impoverished areas , positively develop vocational education , and train qualified personnel needed for the local economic and social development .  
I hope that you would treasure your duty and mission , cultivate a strong enterprising spirit and sense of responsibility , and devote your thoughts and energies to the successful running of the broadcasting industry .  You should learn , learn and learn again , penetrate , penetrate and penetrate still deeper .  You should draw wisdom and nourishments from the fervent activities of reform and construction and from the practice of the masses in creating a beautiful future in order to improve your political quality , spiritual outlook and vocational level .  
We should continue to increase investment in education , ensure the basic need in promoting compulsory education in rural areas , support the construction of foundation facilities for schools of higher learning , develop middle and high level professional education , strengthen vocational and technical training , and encourage people in the society to run schools .  
Other chapters in the handbook are also updated on HAD service , immigration , social welfare , education , employment , vocational training , public housing , medical care , family planning , transport , recreational and cultural venues , postal services , legal aid , consumers ' rights , corruption prevention , emergency services , and a list of NGOs providing services for new arrivals .  
Also , participating training bodies are ready to provide an extensive range of vocational training opportunities for skills upgrading , " the spokesman said .  " Members of the public should make use of this invaluable occasion to keep track of the most up-to-date careers opportunities so as to prepare themselves for the challenges ahead in the increasingly competitive world of work . "  
The handbook contains information on HAD 's services , immigration , social welfare , education , employment , vocational training , public housing , medical care , family planning , transport , recreational and cultural venues , postal services , legal aid , consumer rights , social order , corruption prevention , emergency services , environmental protection , The Ombudsman , Pedestrian Code , protection of intellectual property and a list of non-governmental organisations providing services for new arrivals .  
The Competition is divided into two categories .  Category A is for full-time senior secondary students ( From 4 to 7 ) nominated by the secondary schools of those participants attended .  Category B is for full-time post-secondary students from local universities , colleges and institutes of vocational education , etc .  Entries can be submitted by individual or in teams consisting up to four members from the same school .  
Thus , subjects of academic , practical , vocational and integrated nature will be included in the curriculum to meet the different personal and vocational needs of students as well as the social , economic and technological demands of Hong Kong 's development .  
A draft Vocational Training Law completed by the Ministry of Interior to cope with the national economic and social developments is a start . Its aim is to obtain more skilled laborers , to provide full employment and to set up a permanent vocational training system . The vocational training program is being given top priority in the Six-Year Economic Development Plan .  
The Central Taiwan Vocational Training Center , the southern and northern Taiwan vocational training centers operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the Taishan vocational training center operated by the Ministry of the Interior , the first youth vocational training center run by the National Youth Commission , the northern provincial vocational training center , Taipei municipal vocational training center , eastern Taiwan vocational training center , and a vocational training center for retired servicemen .  
Their eldest son Che-ho turned 17 this year . Ever since he entered the equivalent of tenth grade in his vocational high school-cum-junior college , parents Chung Chiang-shan and Chang Pi-yun have seen their son pulled between what he 's been taught at home , on the one hand , and peer pressures and the lures of modern society on the other . Che-ho started asking if he could stay out until late at night . He dyed his hair , made repeated pleas for a pager and secretly brought his girlfriend home .  
In the blueprint drawn up by the Ministry of Education , because vocational high schools will be exam-free , students below 18 years of age will experience the opportunity to make an independent choice . Whether they want to go to high school and then to university , or to go the way of vocational education , their direction will be determined in advance , so the number of candidates sitting for the university joint entrance examination will probably be smaller than it is today .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
This second limitation means that some 2.6 million " workers with no fixed employer " and self-employed people will be excluded from the unemployment insurance system . Their loss will be compensated by their being excused from paying the 1% of Labor Insurance contributions earmarked for unemployment insurance , and they will continue to be eligible for the existing assistance such as vocational training and new-job bonuses and loans . CLA chairman Chan Huo-sheng also promises that in the future , unemployment insurance will be gradually extended to cover these workers .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education . "  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
It required " a grade one vocational qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a junior college of that time ] and a grade two academic qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a three-year technical high school of that time ] . Preparing for the test was difficult . Days were hard after you went to work too , both in the training period and when you actually were working . If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students . The result is that the schools in the middle end up getting overloaded .  
According to Gu Weiqin , another relative involved with the running of Mingda , " The only advantage for Mingda was that Yangzhou University had been around for a long time and had a very good reputation . A diploma from Yangzhou University carried considerable cachet , and was more attractive to students . A graduate from the Chinese Department of Fudan University in Shanghai , Gu Weiqin is a former department head at a vocational school in Nanchang , capital of Jiangxi Province .  
From the 1970s to the beginning of 1990s , entrance to these schools was fixed at a ratio of 30:70 . No matter how strong the desire of students to continue toward university , seven out of every ten were forced out of the university track and into the vocational track right after leaving junior high ( i.e . just before their tenth year in school ) . These have been the real victims left on the school advancement battlefield .  
Since 1991 more than 100 new public and private high schools ( including comprehensive high schools ) have been founded , so now there are more than 270 such institutions . Meanwhile , the ratio of students entering academic vs . vocational tracks has been adjusted to 45:55 . This means that today more than 40% of kids can keep their university dream alive after junior high school .  
Lin was born in 1959 in Taitung County 's Kuanshan . After graduating from junior high school , Lin 's father hoped that he would study at a vocational school and develop an occupational skill . However , Lin 's heart was set on going to senior high school and then to university . The father and son clashed and the result was that Lin attended neither vocational school nor high school ; he left home and headed for Taipei instead .  
" I graduated second to last of my whole elementary school , " Lu explains . " My sister was my homeroom teacher during my first year in junior high . She felt that I learned too slowly , so she had me sent to the special education class . It took me four years to graduate from middle school , and because I could n't pass the high school entrance exam , I went to vocational school .  
Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education . The technical and vocational education infrastructure has undergone major changes over the last few years . Vocational high schools have been reduced in scale and become increasingly unclear about their role , while senior technical colleges have begun to resemble standard universities , with many actually choosing to upgrade to university status . With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
Although the rapid expansion of senior technical and vocational education has been able to meet student demand for degrees , another problem has arisen . With the rapid transformation of Taiwan 's industrial structure , there has been an increase in demand for individuals with specific skills . Vocational education now faces the problem of providing people with skills for which there is insufficient market demand . Supply and demand imbalance  
With falling student numbers and faced with apparent apathy , technical and vocational colleges have been forced to adjust their developmental goals in order to survive , and this has thrown the entire system into crisis .  
Chang Tien-fu says : " Schools chose to focus on transforming themselves and in the process forgot their own position and character . " Although many schools did change their name , their relative position in the educational hierarchy was not improved . On the contrary , having reorganized themselves many technical and vocational schools began to turn their back on earlier achievements . In other words , they stopped focusing on the need for practical work and started to emphasize theory and R &amp; D .  
It is a great pity , but as the number of graduation credits required to graduate from the vocational system has declined over the years , and with no rules indicating the minimum number of credits to be earned from practical work , related classes have come under pressure . As a result , many private schools have chosen to cut subjects that involve physical work or extra financing , which ensures students are given fewer and fewer opportunities to familiarize themselves with actual physical operations .  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
Wen Shih-jen , deputy CEO of computer manufacturer Inventec , has likened the importance of cooperation between technical and vocational education and industry to laying the " last mile " in establishing the Internet : " The final section needed to ensure the Internet is linked with actual users is known as the ' last mile . ' Without this section users would be unable to get online and the Internet would be a wasted opportunity . "  
In point of fact , the development of technical and vocational education can not be considered in isolation from the motivations of broader education policy . At a time when standard universities and colleges seem unsure of their own development and are establishing an increasing number of money-making , functional departments , they have begun to impinge on a market formerly considered the preserve of vocational schools . Little wonder then that concerns have been voiced that measures introduced by the Ministry of Education will gradually result in the collapse of technical and vocational education .  
As a result some schools were able to establish strategic alliances with both public and independent junior high schools and with industry in Malaysia . As well as providing scholarships to encourage students to study in Taiwan , vocational colleges will in future also allow teachers to visit Malaysia to engage in cooperative programs with local firms to assist them in enhancing their technology .  
Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree . And though Taiwan 's licensing system is not yet fully developed , Yu-Da Institute still requires that students get at least two licenses in order to graduate . People studying data processing , for example , have to get a Class C computer technician license and pass the General English Proficiency Test .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
Chen Chin-chin , principal of Taichung Industrial High School , feels the technical and vocational education system , an alternative to the usual route through high school and then college and sometimes referred to as the " second track , " was very difficult to set up in the first place and that it is an integral part of the nation 's wellbeing . So , how can one talk lightly about abolishing it ?  
In addition to technical and vocational students continuing on in education in large numbers and thus leading to the withering away of the " inherently " inferior " second track , " the lack of official expenditures in this area have amounted to " kicking a man when he is down , " and the gap between the two national educational " tracks " has widened significantly .  
Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
Some people say straight out that the comprehensive high school can only attract students of middling ability . Requiring these students to study with a dual orientation and to " explore " multiple areas causes them to fall even further behind their senior high school counterparts in the general curriculum . Added to this , they are not as good as vocational high school students in technical subjects-so they end up " losing out at both ends . "  
The Ministry of Education plans call for the current seven types of vocational high schools with their 70 different courses to develop in different directions . Navigation and nursing courses , for example , will be raised to the technical college level , equivalent to higher education . Some industry sectors will be adjusted to the post-technical college level , commerce and home economics will primarily train people for the service industry , and responding to Taiwan 's entry into WTO , agricultural studies will develop in the direction of specialized agricultural education .  
From a cross-sectional perspective , reform has included changes in the core curriculum , a freeing up of the types of instructional materials used , and a variety of assessment methods , admissions , and approaches to teacher training . From a vertical perspective , reform has included the widespread establishment of new high schools and universities , the localization of normal and vocational high schools , policies regarding independent study in junior high schools , basic education testing , the promotion of English in elementary schools , and native-language instruction .  
ILO continued to provide technical advisory service to a number of OAU-sponsored regional and subregional institutions concerned with vocational rehabilitation and training , occupational safety and health , and migration and social security .  
Provide scientific data and training , stressing the interdisciplinary approach to problem solving in national specific issues and strengthen the development of environmental education programmes as part of basic , higher , technical and vocational education ;  
Assistance to human resources development totalled US $ 56 million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
The Revolutionary Youth Movement to which the youth of Syria belong is an organizational framework and an educational forum for young people through which Syria 's youth exercise their its democratic rights , elect their political leaderships , practice their hobbies and defend their interests at all levels : the educational , social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic , artistic , informational , ideological , political and technical .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , could establish or enhance vocational and technical training relevant to current and prospective employment conditions .  
Ensure access for all youth to all types of education , wherever appropriate , providing alternative learning structures , ensure that education reflects the economic and social needs of youth and incorporates the concepts of environmental awareness and sustainable development throughout the curricula ; and expand vocational training , implementing innovative methods aimed at increasing practical skills , such as environmental scouting ;  
The Fund will thus actively advocate a holistic approach to empowering women , integrating efforts to improve women 's health , literacy and education , both formal and vocational , with wider efforts to reduce social , legal , cultural and economic disparities based on gender .  
In this context , my Government wishes to emphasize the need for the quick deployment of UNAVEM III , because it alone as we all know will bear responsibility for the quartering , disarming and selection of UNITA troops that are to be integrated into the unified national army of Angola and for the demobilization of the excess military personnel that will be reintegrated into civilian life after receiving vocational training .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , should enhance the relevance of vocational and technical training to both current and prospective employment conditions by applying a broad and flexible approach to human resources development for youth that fosters the capacity of skilled labour to adjust to changes in labour demand .  
Ensure universal and equal access to and completion of primary education by all children and eliminate the existing gap between girls and boys , as stipulated in article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ; 10 / similarly , ensure equal access to secondary education by the year 2005 and equal access to higher education , including vocational and technical education , for all girls and boys , including the disadvantaged and gifted ; 
Other obstacles to the development of businesses owned by women include an adverse economic and regulatory environment , inadequate physical infrastructure and marketing , poor access to new technology , and a lack of vocational and managerial training .  Rigid social and cultural norms and lack of sharing of domestic responsibilities exacerbate the problems women face when operating businesses .

would therefore be advisable to allocate increased resources to basic educational and vocational training , which were essential elements in promoting the economic development of the least developed countries .  
They also include improving public health , with emphasis on prevention and service for the most vulnerable groups especially children including planning , organizing and financing local health services ; improving basic public education , with emphasis on reducing illiteracy and on vocational training , with community participation , improved educational infrastructure , the promotion of culture and so on ; and the improvement of living conditions , physical planning and local infrastructure  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .  
While in the beginning of this partnership large amounts had to be contributed towards emergency measures , today the extensive bilateral development cooperation focuses mainly on the consolidation of structural adaptation processes , the rehabilitation of social infrastructures , the promotion of private enterprises ( including vocational training ) , agricultural development , and the protection of the environment and natural resources .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .

To that end , the Ministry of State responsible for women 's status and problems , in cooperation with other State agencies , had undertaken the collection of gender-based statistics , developed programmes of vocational and technical education for girls and a policy of credit for women entrepreneurs , incorporated women 's human rights in the curricula of human rights education in secondary schools , launched public awareness campaigns and developed measures to eliminate violence against women .  
ILO aimed , in the context of technical programmes implemented at the national level , to give women the means to play a more active economic role by organizing vocational training courses for them in areas traditionally reserved for men , by proposing various measures to develop their entrepreneurship and by organizing workshops to teach them to organize themselves better vis - - vis their employers and to negotiate better working conditions .  
The consequences of substance use are diverse , including acute and chronic health problems , disruption to interpersonal relationships ( particularly within families ) , social marginalization , criminal behaviour , school failure , vocational problems and failure to achieve normal adolescent milestones .  
Admission to general or vocational upper secondary education - which traditionally prepares students for higher education - is subject to a statement issued by their earlier school confirming that they are qualified for studies at this level .  
In addition it appears that occupational and educational counselling is available to all citizens in Greenland , that the counselling is free of charge , and that it is provided by municipal labour market offices , municipal or regional vocational guidance officers , institutions of primary and lower secondary education and institutions of vocational training .
