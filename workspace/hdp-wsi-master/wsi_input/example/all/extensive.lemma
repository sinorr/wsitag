At the " pre-reality line " simulating real combat , we should promote informational training .

The people are now seeking the enhancement of their life quality after they achieved quantitative satisfaction .

Under modern conditions , especially under the conditions of high technologies , fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level .  Firepower has become more extensive , more powerful , and more omnipresent .  It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war .  
Along with the development of the social , political , economic , and cultural life , the independent and optional space for people 's ideological activities will become more extensive .  
These changes will exert an extensive , profound and comprehensive influence on the military 's thinking , and challenge ideological and political education in fundamental and temporal ways .  
The " opinion " also proposes explicit requirements on solutions to many realistic problems in ideological and political construction throughout military academies and universities .

The flames of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea disappeared nearly 50 years ago .  Unprecedented changes have taken place in the international political structure and the world military arena .  However , the valuable experience gained from this war cuts through space-time , exceeds national boundaries , and becomes an extensive and precious historical textbook .  
B : The new challenges and new opportunities require us to have the correct , proper new ideas that go with the flow but also are realistic and practical for us .  Our economic construction should never again embark on a developmental path of extensive expansion .  We should no longer pursue rapid growth only in terms of the total economic volume .  
Thanks to the extensive application of such high-tech research achievements as satellite positioning systems , expert diagnostic systems , and distance support maintenance systems , the space of vast battlefields has been condensed in a tiny screen , in which equipment commanders assumed personal command in a " central command tent " and had the situation of the entire battlefields well in hand without going out , and they were moving units on the Web .  
Relatively speaking , there should be a readjustment of the structural setup of such representative " traditional industries " as the metallurgical , petroleum , coal , textile , machinery , and shipping industries , improving their growth quality and shifting from extensive development to intensive development .  
For this reason , the US military has assigned the units concerned the task of carrying out extensive legislative investigation and studies and of setting to work to implement the issues that need defining in the leadership structure , theoretical setup , and the relevant rules and regulations involved in joint training , and will continue to produce a series of regulatory documents to ensure that joint training proceeds in a regular and orderly way .

The aforementioned three criteria can more or less provide a basic yardstick for the general public who are concerned with things of this category ; and if we view the matter against a more extensive historical background , we can see that orthodox religions also showed a number of imperfect factors down the ages .  
As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .

In the wake of expanded market access , tariff reduction , and elimination of non-tariff measures , foreign products , services , and investment will enter the Chinese markets en masse , and the domestic enterprises will face even more intense competition .  The township enterprises , in particular , are marked by the inherent poor quality among many of them , as demonstrated by , one , some enterprises ' extensive management mode .  Their environment is filthy , chaotic , and inferior ;  
2 ) as nonpublic enterprises are numerous in number and distributed in extensive areas , the management and supervision of their safety are ineffective .  Moreover , there really existed the tendencies that a small number of government workers in charge of supervision and management of production safety neglected their duties and that some corrupt elements even collaborated with lawbreakers so that some owners of individual and private businesses in violation of laws and regulations became emboldened in the knowledge that they had strong backing ;  
Ding Jiye ; A whole series of reforms of our armed forces ' finances have been carried out in recent years , and military expenditure management is now being moved from the traditional empirical and extensive style to modern , scientific , and meticulous management .

There must be rectification while regulating , and regulation while rectifying .

To do so , it is necessary for us to continue to give in-depth publicity to and conduct extensive education in the legal system among the citizens .  
To continue to give in-depth publicity to and conduct extensive education in the legal system nationwide , it involves large areas and arduous tasks ; under the unified leadership of party committees and governments at corresponding levels and with the vigorous support and supervision of people 's congresses and local committees of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , various regions should persist in integrating themselves with relevant departments , take coordinated action , and bring the enthusiasm of localities , industries , and departments into full play in order to form a joint force in work .

Li Lanqing stressed : In rectifying and regulating the market economic order , we must proceed our tasks in a quick , responsible , and extensive manner , and adopt strong policies .  Party committees and governments at all levels must firmly uphold the principle of tackling current and long-term tasks , realistically strengthen leadership in this work , divide the work , cooperate closely , and work with concerted efforts to achieve a decisive victory .

The united front made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reforms and scored brilliant achievements .  
The party needs to realize the most extensive great unity with all allied forces not only when the party is weak but also when the party has grown stronger , not only when the party is fighting to seize the political power but also when the party is holding the ruling status , not only when the party is carrying out revolution but also when the party is engaged in construction and reforms .
