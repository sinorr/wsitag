When they discovered a refrigerator made 30 years ago still being used in one family 's kitchen , their hearts lit up with pride .  
As they entered the farm , Chang Chih-man led his bride-to-be to the front of a grave . The tombstone could not be considered grandiose and was made of gray stone slabs and concrete . Carved on its surface was the inscription , " Tomb of the misfortunate father and sons Chang Chi-lang , Tsung-jen and Kuo-jen who unjustly met their deaths on the night of 4 April , 1947 . " The parallel verses to each side read : " Two sons as companions ; Patriotic fervor floods the plains beyond the town . "  
The more powerful the backwave , the faster the base will be washed away .

In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations .

Chang Chin-un , a designer and consultant for several large hospitals and president of the Hospital Association of the Republic of China , points out a direction which is concrete . Group-practice clinics should be established to draw in patients with a stronger line-up of physicians and advanced equipment , as well as striking up a cooperative relationship with large hospitals , further strengthening a bi lateral referral system .

Taiwan had long hoped to join CITES and play a larger role in international conservation , but had always been hindered by political factors .

Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness .

It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture .

To the immediate right are densely packed grey residential buildings and high-rises in the downtown . Electrical power stations and petrochemical and metal industry plants are crowded along the coast and the Kaoping River . Oil tanks , incinerator towers , and smokestacks look like pillars to a wall surrounding the city . To the left is a low mountain , which has been half shaved away for material to make concrete ; bald and grey , it has an eerie appearance .  
This knowledge might have been fragmentary and far from concrete , but it certainly conveyed the stress on the imitation of nature and the mastery of the untrammeled principles of its creation .

As Kung Peng-cheng sees it , modern Taiwan society is changing even more dramatically than was society in Zhu Xi 's time . It has inherited the problem of ascendant Western culture and declining Eastern culture that arose in the late Qing , and has added to this the disruptions of industrial and commercial development and rapid modernization . Yet , though Chinese have been arguing for a century about how best to cope with such changes , no very concrete systems have taken shape .  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like .

"

In imposing its rule over Taiwan , Japan deliberately gave concrete forms to its imperial authority , as we can see from many historical documents .

Provided the heightened international political attention to the plight of the fragile ecosystems of drylands translates into political commitment and action at the national level , concrete , local action has the potential to become effective and transformative .  
But beyond those concrete achievements , the fact that all the Council 's decisions have been adopted by consensus , that all the Commissioners have also been appointed by consensus and that all their recommendations are unanimous and also approved by the Council by consensus , always without a vote , gives the Commission outstanding legal , political and moral authority . 
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;

The hostile actions of the United States represent a concrete example of organized State terrorism being committed against the people of Iraq by a major Power without regard for the humanitarian and material consequences that such illegal and unlawful actions may entail .  
It recently took concrete form , as everyone knows , through the freezing of the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron , the refusal to resume negotiations on the final situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , the return to the policy of settlements , the blocking off of the Palestinian territories , the confiscation of Arab lands and the collective economic sanctions and daily acts of violence against the unarmed civilian population .  
They are , rather , the direct result of a long-term and focused plan of action that took concrete and unmistakable shape following the assumption of power by the new Israeli Government , which is pursuing an aggressive expansionist policy in violation of the agreements concluded by the former Government of Israel .  
The Special Rapporteur repeats that no peace worthy of the name can be established in Burundi unless an equitable solution is found to the above-mentioned problem , a solution that provides strong guarantees to the minority once and for all , ensures respect for democracy and leads , at last , to a real sharing of power on concrete and realistic bases , so that the tremendous social and economic inequalities that continue to beset Burundi society may be overcome .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated their support for the convening , in 1998 , of a special session of the General Assembly dedicated to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and drug-related offences , from which new strategies should arise to tackle in an integral manner the problem of illegal drugs , and concrete mechanisms should be formulated for international cooperation for the fight against that phenomenon .  
In his message , the Secretary-General pointed out that the International Decade promotes concrete action in such vital areas as human rights , protection of the environment and access to health and education - areas in which indigenous people must be actively involved ; and also referred to the efforts the United Nations system can make to enhance international cooperation and understanding on issues of central concern to the world 's indigenous people .  
The Parties recognize each other 's rights and the rights of each of the littoral States to carry out activities connected with the exploitation of the mineral and biological resources in their respective parts and sectors of the Caspian Sea , and they will exchange concrete proposals on the development of mutually advantageous cooperation , including geophysical and geological survey activities and the exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits , bearing in mind the experience and capabilities of the Parties .  
In order to better review the promotion and practical realization of the Declaration , the Working Group decided to collect information on the constitutions and legislation of States in respect of the protection and promotion of the rights of minorities , and to commission the preparation of short studies on the content and scope of the core principles contained in the Declaration , including the formulation of specific and concrete recommendations for their application in different countries and regions of the world .  
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .  
The Charter lay down objectives and principles to be respected by States and proposed concrete measures to put them into effect in the fields of education , courts of law , administrative authorities and public services , the media , cultural facilities and economic and social life .  
Expressing its solidarity with the people and countries that suffer as a result of natural disasters and expressing also the deepest sympathy to all victims of the natural disasters that have struck in various parts of the globe , Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,  
Instead , as can be seen in the conclusions that form the annex to the draft resolution submitted to the Assembly , the Working Groups identified selected areas in which to carry out a fair and impartial assessment of achievements over the past five years , and produced concrete and realistic recommendations to be implemented through cooperation and partnership among all the parties concerned .  
It is also important to set the ways and means to achieve this by utilizing not only official development assistance but also private investment , trade , social infrastructure building , human capacity development , and all other elements which are essential to achieving those targets , as well as by devising an ideal policy mix to suit the concrete socio-economic conditions of the countries involved .  
To taking effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursuing effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encouraging the adoption of laws for these purposes where they do not exist , and to calling upon private and public corporations and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of this Declaration ;  
Technical support and cooperation are provided in order to yield concrete results , with special attention being devoted to human resource development and institution-building designed to contribute better to the efforts of recipient countries to create an overall enabling environment at a policy and institutional level .  
Procedures for developing the Unit 's programme of work will ensure that the items chosen are of major interest to Member States and constitute a direct response to the General Assembly 's request to JIU to continue focusing its reports on important priority items and identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing it and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations .  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;

Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Notes that further progress , including new and concrete measures and swift implementation of innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
For the LDCs to reap the full potential benefit of the Uruguay Round Agreements , concrete and positive action should be directed at two broad areas : measures to overcome , or at least ameliorate , structural weaknesses of the LDCs in order to enhance their trade performance ; and effective implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements , and the expeditious implementation of the S &amp; amp ; D provisions and the Decisions on Measures in Favour of LDCs as well as consideration of further S &amp; amp ; D treatment .

Panama recommends the inclusion of provisions , as very special legislation , that are directed at committing States to social policy allocating greater budgetary resources to finance institutions for the physical and psychological rehabilitation of children who are victims of armed conflicts , and supports efforts to implement State social policy giving concrete form to the real will of Governments . Sixth .  
The Panel agreed that [ existing or any future body of ] [ any future ] international forest-related legal mechanism [ s ] must deal cohesively with all the interrelated social , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues and have a concrete impact on the future successful implementation of [ sustainable forest management ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] worldwide .  
With the improvement of the international political climate , the dangers posed by nuclear war and the arms race are receding , while prospects for taking concrete steps on practical disarmament are improving .  
The shared effort to build a culture of peace in the region has changed from an academic discussion to a fact of everyday life , in which we are promoting and fostering the concrete values of peace : tolerance , respect for human rights , solidarity , social justice and the rejection of violence as a method of resolving social or any other type of conflicts , all elements that are contributing to the integral development of our peoples .  
And for peace to be truly meaningful it must also be translated into concrete improvements in the living conditions of the long-suffering Palestinian people ; hence , there is an urgent need for economic , financial and technical assistance by the international community .  
In the light of existing realities in the disarmament process , in which international instruments are still under discussion and various questions are under negotiation , my delegation recommends allocating more time for concrete measures to be implemented in this area and suggests that it would be convenient to postpone the date of the fourth special session devoted to disarmament to a later time , perhaps until the year 2000 .  
The four specific action areas laid out in the mission statement - operational assistance , advancement of understanding of the issues , encouragement of social and economic development through migration , and upholding the human dignity and well-being of migrants - permeate the Programme of Action , too , and provide a solid basis for IOM 's institutional commitment to moving the international consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development towards concrete action .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals clearly set out by the Conference , the mobilization of resources must be placed high on the global development agenda , and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
With a view to finding durable and concrete solutions to the problem of the sale and commercial sexual exploitation of children , the Special Rapporteur is making an urgent appeal to Governments , non-governmental organizations , and all concerned agencies and individuals , to keep her informed on a regular and sustained basis of developments in matters under her mandate , including specific situations of child abuse in any country .  
Taking measures - no matter how good they may be - will not suffice ; such measures must be backed by concrete actions demonstrating the political will to crush all discrimination and to improve the study conditions of students and the living conditions of teachers , especially in this transitional period of declining teaching quality and school attendance , as well as of failure to recognize the importance of the teacher 's function ( the level of remuneration is so low that many are abandoning that noble profession ) .  
The Special Rapporteur ventures to remind them that there can be no lasting peace in Burundi until an equitable solution is found to the crucial problem of power _ sharing between the minority and majority on a concrete and realistic basis , providing the minority with sound and genuine guarantees and ensuring that the rights of the majority are firmly respected , in order to overcome the deep _ rooted socio _ economic inequalities from which Burundi society continues to suffer .  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
The Panel recognized that institutional needs include the strengthening of existing national research institutions ; subregional and regional networks ; joint research ventures ; approaches to enhancing and strengthening existing international , regional , subregional and national forest research institutions ' participation in an international network dedicated to the conservation and sustainable development , management and utilization of forests and forest policy research ; and the creation of appropriate mechanisms that could enable research findings to reach policy and field levels more effectively and could support concrete action .  
The Panel agreed that in order to achieve the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests it is necessary to deal coherently with all the interrelated social , cultural , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues that have a concrete impact on those objectives .  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , with a view to enabling the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
Before proceeding to the concrete facts that will serve as evidence of flagrant violation by the separatists of the norms of international humanitarian law , it is necessary to consider the issue as to whether the " ethnic cleansing " referred to in the above-mentioned documents and as it is being pursued in Abkhazia can be considered a crime against humanity and a form of genocide , since upon that depends the appropriateness of raising the question of bringing the accused to trial before an international tribunal .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
Pressure for " concrete " results is observed and behavioural models are sought among " profit-making " enterprises without there necessarily being any understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of the processes of human and community development , which by definition cover a more prolonged timespan .  
It recommended a profound judicial reform that would give the judicial system the capacity to sanction violations of human rights ; constitutional reforms in a number of areas ; the strengthening of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights ; the adoption of reforms in the armed forces and in the public security sector ; the investigation of illegal armed groups , or death squads ; and concrete measures to achieve national reconciliation .  
The permanent reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life extends well beyond successful disarmament and is determined by whether or not there exist concrete , long-term options for obtaining a sustainable livelihood and participating in the social and political life of the country .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung took the landmark initiative of demolishing the concrete walls built up on the south side of the military demarcation line , allowing free travel between the north and the south , and holding north-south high-level talks and the north-south summit talks to remove the root cause of the war and accelerate the process of peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula in the next few years .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Similarly , the international community 's assertions of true partnership with Africa in the face of failing official development assistance and impossible debt repayments to mention just two major constraints may soon sound hollow unless that partnership manifests itself in concrete programmes of action .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
These measures are intrinsically linked to the just and lasting resolution of conflicts , the peaceful settlement of disputes , concrete and effective measures of disarmament through the accession of all the States of the region to the multinational agreements on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction ( the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Chemical Weapons Convention , the Biological Weapons Convention , etc . ) , and to the placement of all nuclear installations under international control .  
While these developments are not in themselves sufficient to dispel our anxieties about the safety of our planet from the threat of weapons of mass destruction , we should seize the moment and take concrete steps to consolidate the limited gains that have been realized , and move to resolve the outstanding disagreements which have stalled initiatives to find lasting solutions to fundamental disarmament issues .  
Furthermore , this is a concrete , effective security mechanism that is relatively easy to implement and helps avoid misunderstandings and errors while fostering in-depth , constructive dialogue that enhances mutual understanding and alerts the international community to the excessive stockpiling of weapons .  
It was realistic in that it focused on concrete partnerships and practical solutions , and would tap the human , technological and financial resources which had been beyond the reach of the United Nations , and which had become far greater than official development assistance .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
In paragraph 12 of the same resolution , the General Assembly requested the Unit to continue to focus its reports on important priority items , identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing the Assembly and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations on precisely defined issues .  
By eliminating the world 's third biggest nuclear arms stock , and by recently signing a number of basic bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the charter on special partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , Ukraine has made an essential contribution to strengthening European and world security , thus having a concrete input in implementing the lofty goals enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce . 
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
In this spirit , the United Nations must look for the best ways and means to make its activities in the area of social development more effective , including by strengthening coordination between economic and social activities and improving coordination with international financial institutions , since only through concrete and pragmatic programmes can our Organization get more out of the aid and assistance it provides to States for the establishment of social policies .  
Such reaffirmation of the international community \ x { e5b8 } interest in recognizing and consolidating linguistic diversity should at the same time be accompanied by concrete acts and daily gestures to ensure a harmonious , mutually beneficial and fruitful coexistence among all cultures .  
The sponsors are submitting these three draft resolutions driven by a strong desire that the Organization should make a further concrete and constructive contribution to the multiplicity of efforts bilateral , multilateral or undertaken by individuals or by Governments aimed at bringing about a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine .  
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
We believe that measures aimed at curbing mines should be accompanied by serious and concrete steps geared towards mine clearance in affected countries that are unable to achieve that objective on their own , by providing technical and financial support and through the transfer of necessary advanced technology to enable these States to overcome this tragic legacy . 
The European Union expects the Disarmament Commission to live up to expectations , and looks forward to working in a constructive and balanced manner in the coming weeks towards concrete results to guide future multilateral disarmament efforts . 
At its fifty _ second session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1996 / 15 , reaffirmed that the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development required perseverance and concrete efforts and that that dynamic process should be pursued at all appropriate levels , including through the elaboration of international and national strategies , which required the effective contribution of States , organs and organizations of the United Nations system and of non-governmental organizations active in that field .  
Although no concrete data are available , there is overall recognition that the level of technology and technology-related investments from public and private sources in developed countries directed to developing countries has not , in general , been realized as envisaged at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
In the context which I have just outlined , my country believes that the best chance we have here today to begin work which can produce rapid and concrete results which are understandable and expected by the entire international community lies in establishing as soon as possible an ad hoc committee to negotiate a comprehensive ban on anti _ personnel mines by means of a step _ by _ step approach .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Procedures for developing the Unit 's programme of work will ensure that the items chosen are of major interest to Member States and constitute a direct response to the General Assembly 's request to JIU to continue focusing its reports on important priority items and identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing it and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations .

In resolution 42 / 169 of 11 December 1987 , the General Assembly , " convinced that concerted international action for the reduction of natural disasters over the course of the 1990s would give genuine impetus to a series of concrete measures " decided to designate the 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction .  
The development of " a concrete proposal for an effective international mechanism on early warning , to include the transfer of technologies related to early warning to developing countries " requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 50 / 117 B of 20 December 1995 , is just one specialized form of the comprehensive information management responsibility assigned to the Decade secretariat .  
Many of those interviewed by the Central Evaluation Unit stated that background papers and proposals for policy decisions were usually distributed too late , and as a result agency representatives often did not come to the meetings prepared to act on proposals ; many meetings had been convened with no concrete objectives set ; and work initiated by the Working Group on specific issues had been pursued in an on-and-off fashion , only reaching conclusion three to four years after initiation .  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , to enable the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
The agreed conclusions adopted on women and the environment focused on mainstreaming a gender perspective , translating it into concrete actions and moving beyond the concept of women as a major group . 4 For example , all actors at the international level were requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrate a gender perspective into sustainable development and to apply a gender perspective in all funding programmes for sustainable development , while acknowledging the importance of continuing programming targeted at women . 
In his paper , Mr . Alfredsson suggested that better use should be made of international and bilateral technical cooperation programmes with a view to enhancing respect for minority rights at the domestic level ; that the Working Group should show , using concrete examples , that dialogue and technical cooperation could be effective mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution ; that the Working Group might encourage research on topics of particular relevance to its mandate and ensure that the guidelines on State reporting addressed minority concerns .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
In paragraph 3 of the same resolution , the Assembly also invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with their views on ( a ) effective ways and means of collecting weapons transferred illicitly , in particular in the light of experience gained by the United Nations ; and ( b ) concrete proposals concerning measures at national , regional and international levels to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms .  
They had also pointed out that total compliance with the principle of shared responsibility ought produce more concrete results and a global and balanced view of the drugs problem which would facilitate the coordination of activities at the national , regional and world level in conformity with the principles of international law .  
That would be a fitting occasion for the submission of concrete proposals for ensuring that the new models of international cooperation would be translated effectively into reality , enabling sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
Some countries were still suffering from the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , particularly with regard to health and educational infrastructure and services , which necessitated strengthening of international cooperation based on the adoption and implementation of concrete measures aimed at mitigating and completely eliminating their adverse impact .  
By this all or nothing approach practised in the CD this year , concrete progress on specific and timely issues , issues ripe for multilateral negotiation , was held hostage to demands for an agreement to negotiate multilaterally nuclear disarmament in a time _ bound framework .  
That consensus had found concrete expression in the declarations and programmes of action of the major United Nations conferences , the themes of which - economic growth , the environment , population , human rights , social development , the advancement of women and human settlements - now should be articulated in the agenda for development , a fundamental document which should guide development worldwide on the eve of the twenty-first century .  
In addition , the conversion of policy declarations into concrete policies and actions at both the national and the international levels required not only political will but also adequate allocations of financial and human resources .  
The Inter-Parliamentary Union continued to provide strong and concrete support to the major international conferences or summit conferences organized by the United Nations to address issues relating to sustainable economic and social development .  
If indeed there is a genuine desire to prevent humanitarian disaster or to avoid costly peacekeeping operations and peacemaking efforts , then comprehensive , concerted and concrete action on economic development cooperation must be taken .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
The lack of political commitment was also identified by a few responses , leading to protracted , artificial and unnecessary international negotiations without any concrete results , especially at the field level .  
In its resolution 50 / 233 of 7 June 1996 , the General Assembly requested the Joint Inspection Unit to continue to focus its reports on important priority items , identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing the Assembly and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations on precisely defined issues .

The Peruvian Government , for its part , considered that the World Conference should formulate concrete recommendations making it possible to increase the effectiveness of existing machinery used to combat racial discrimination and to adopt additional measures at the national , regional and international levels to strengthen those already in place .  
As for concrete recommendations to combat racial discrimination at the international level , the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that the promotion of genuine dialogue , mutual understanding , a culture of tolerance , and enhanced cooperation and participation would contribute to the gradual realization of a global civil society in which the phenomena of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia are doomed to complete eradication . 
When the General Assembly had adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 , the Governments of the region had felt confident that they would take concrete measures to reduce high infant and maternal mortality rates and severe malnutrition and to provide universal access to basic education , health and safe drinking water .  That had not happened , however , and most Governments , particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa , had fallen far short of the goals set for the year 2000 .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the note by the Secretariat on the review of the status of the five international legal instruments governing outer space ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 210 and Add . 1 ) contained valuable analyses of and concrete proposals on the elimination of obstacles preventing the universal acceptance of the five international legal instruments governing outer space that warranted further consideration .

From my perspective as a former President of the CD , I am inclined more and more to consider the Presidential troika mechanism as a tool in resolving complicated procedural issues , such as the establishment of a subsidiary body , as exemplified by its activities last year , and not as suitable for the conduct of regular discussions on one concrete issue and its set of closely related aspects .

Both the training sessions and the Symposium featured a lively exchange of views , further development of the training materials for local use and concrete first steps towards creating a dynamic knowledge base on these issues within the PA public and private sectors .  
The success of the review of the mechanisms can best be judged by achieving such a balance through concrete proposals , such as assigning equal budgetary and human resources to both civil and political and to economic , social and cultural rights .  
Her delegation was disappointed that the " Issues for consideration " document provided few pragmatic and concrete recommendations on the role that international cooperation could play in building up physical infrastructure in the transport sector , and no concrete suggestion had been put forward on how to strengthen and improve international cooperation , particularly in improving financial resource availability for transport infrastructure development .

In canton 6 , based on a full operational review of the Ministry of Interior and all municipal police administrations , UNMIBH has developed a " three-point plan " of concrete steps for the creation of a multi-ethnic , fully integrated professional police force , which is insulated from inappropriate external influences .  
The executive bodies of the various nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties constitute concrete examples of existing regional arrangements , but their capabilities need to be augmented and their political role needs to be acknowledged by the international community .  
We look forward to starting the preparation for the summit , which should adopt a balanced approach between political and economic issues , reflecting the global nature of European Union-Africa partnership in order to ensure concrete results . 
At the start of a new millennium , therefore , a fundamental challenge for the international community is to enhance the coherence and consistency of macroeconomic policies at the intergovernmental level and at the level of international institutions , as well as to implement concrete measures and initiatives designed to secure the integration of developing countries into the globalizing world economy on an equitable basis .  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information and a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
Taking note of the Sarajevo Summit Declaration , in which the participants affirm their collective and individual readiness to give concrete meaning to the Pact by promoting political and economic reforms , development and enhanced security in the region and also their commitment to make every effort to assist countries in the region to make speedy and measurable progress along this road ,  
This could be achieved if the international community would : recognize the special situation and needs of African countries , particularly supply constraints ; apply differential treatment in favour of developing countries , including small and vulnerable economies , in a concrete and comprehensive fashion ; and remove all barriers facing the trade of African countries , in particular of the least developed countries .

Calls upon all States to translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urges them , inter alia , to immediately eliminate the worst forms of child labour as set out in the new International Labour Organization Convention No .  182 ;  
The Governing Council session had given concrete support to the integrated work programme of UNEP , which was based on five areas of concentration environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning , enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; freshwater ; technology transfer in industry ; and support to Africa and had endorsed its new functional organizational structure .  
Being the most obvious concrete public organization to hold accountable for the consequences of the otherwise acephalous international trading system creates an obvious potential for political discomfort .  
Also calls upon all States to translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urges them , inter alia , to immediately eliminate the worst forms of child labour as set out in the new International Labour Organization Convention No .  182 ;  
Notes , in particular , Governing Council decision 20 / 31 of 4 February 1999 , entitled Proposed programme budget of the United Nations Environment Programme : revised requirements for the biennium 1998-1999 and proposed requirements for the biennium 2000-2001 , which gives concrete support to the integrated work programme of the Programme and endorsement of its new functional organizational structure , and anticipates an increased level of funding to the Environment Fund for the biennium 2000-2001 ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
So the systemic contest was founded on a similar set of proclaimed values or objectives : rationality , efficiency and equity on a general level , and modernization , growth and an improved living standard for the majority on a more concrete level .  
In its resolution 1999 / 52 , the Commission decided to re-establish the open-ended inter-sessional ad hoc working group established in accordance with resolution 1998 / 20 to meet for eight working days prior to the fifty-sixth session of the Commission , and requested the working group to submit , with a view to completing its task , one or more concrete proposals on the establishment of a permanent forum for consideration by the Commission at that session .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
An internationally concerted framework for improving early warning by developing concrete proposals for an effective international mechanism , including the transfer of technology to developing countries , under the auspices of the United Nations as part of the implementation of related actions of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , should be established .  
In this context , my delegation would like to point out the necessity of strict observance by all the Member States of the World Summit decisions , which assigned concrete tasks and defined common approaches towards ensuring further social progress and improving the living conditions of the people of the world .  
This , however , has not prevented us from taking concrete steps that demonstrate our clear desire for peace and general and complete disarmament , as well as demonstrating the transparency and peaceful nature of the nuclear programme we are developing.I have the honour to report to the plenary Assembly that last month Cuba signed a protocol additional to the safeguards agreements that it entered into on a voluntary basis with the IAEA .  
The international community has paid close attention to the protection of national cultural property and established concrete norms of international law in the area of preserving the cultural property of nations through relevant international treaties and conventions .  
We will strengthen the dialogue with the OAU and subregional organizations on concrete possibilities for backing their efforts , inter alia in the fields of early warning , preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and of awareness of the importance of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , the rule of law , a pluralist society , democratic institutions and practices , and a culture of tolerance .  
This clearly shows how we intend to move forward in our future efforts and that we are serious about seeking to complement social and economic policy with sustainable development initiatives.A concrete proposal which we are currently pursuing is the idea that the outer island health centres should have solar-power electricity .  
He also described my countrys vision of the future in the light of the architecture of the current international system , and he formulated some concrete proposals to further the search for solutions to the many grave problems facing humanity , now and in the future , particularly the dilemma of the developing countries .  
From the practice of other international human rights treaty bodies , it is evident to the Netherlands delegation that the admissibility criteria contained in article 4 , paragraph 2 , subparagraph iii ( manifestly ill-founded or not sufficiently substantiated ) are concrete illustrations of the general admissibility criterion contained in article 4 , paragraph 2 , subparagraph ii , which provides that a communication should be compatible with the provisions of the Convention .  
This is also true for the more general subject of transparency in conventional weapons , where we consider the Conference can and must complete the valuable work accomplished by the Ad Hoc Committee established between the years 1992 and 1995 , to define concrete measures likely to increase confidence amongst States and strengthen international security .  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
The key to this success was the fact that ( 1 ) the Summit was organized around a number of very concrete developmental problems which affected major aspects of the development process and ( 2 ) a common interest between UNCTAD and non-governmental actors had been clearly identified in advance .  
While the deliberative process is still ongoing , the greater understanding of the implications of environmental protection for the sustainability of socio-economic development and for the improvement of the quality of life has induced concrete actions in small island developing States to begin the implementation of the Programme of Action .  
In accordance with its original terms of reference , the Committee on Contributions should make concrete recommendations on the methodology for determining the scale of assessments , with a view to making it objective and equitable , and should take into account the problems of developing countries , such as their difficulties in earning foreign exchange and the economic strain of taking in refugees .  
Taking note of the Sarajevo Summit Declaration , in which the participants affirm their collective and individual readiness to give concrete meaning to the Pact by promoting political and economic reforms , development and enhanced security in the region and also their commitment to make every effort to assist countries in the region to make speedy and measurable progress along this road ,  
International cooperation to that end must be strengthened and the relevant international organizations must take concrete measures , such as technology transfer , financial support and scientific and technical training , in favour of the developing countries .  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information and a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
These visits offered valuable opportunities to discuss the political , legal and practical problems in affected areas , as well as requirements for concrete action at the international , regional and national levels .  
These problems are global , but they require specific strategies , concrete goals and committed action at the international , regional , national , local and individual levels .  
An eventual convention on fissile material should be a concrete step forward in the nuclear disarmament process and should not be limited to being just another instrument of selective nonproliferation .  
In conclusion , the representative emphasized Indias determined , concrete and sustained efforts to eliminate poverty and social disability and empower the poor and vulnerable .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
Although confidencebuilding measures whether they be military , political , economic , commercial , cultural or humanitarian are no substitute for concrete disarmament measures , they can play an important role in progress towards disarmament .  
A major concrete aim is to mobilize additional governmental and private resources , including professional knowledge , and financial and human resources , to address key rights issues for children and women .  
Nevertheless , we are aware that although budgetary allocations are vital , other factors are required in order for social policy to be effectively translated into concrete actions , into tangible , everyday wellbeing for the people .  
Declarations of commitment to the protection of human rights are only effective , and indeed meaningful , if they are backed by genuine political will and translated into concrete decisions and policies at the national level .  
A concrete ceiling for the total ERUs acquired from projects under Article 6 shall be defined in quantitative and qualitative terms based on equitable criteria .  
A concrete ceiling for the total ERUs acquired from projects under Article 6 shall be defined in quantitative and qualitative terms based on equitable criteria .  
The constructive role played by civil society organizations in raising public awareness on the issue of conflict diamonds , proposing practical solutions and helping generate the necessary political will required for concrete action .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors , including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
Accordingly , the highly concrete and humane goals embodied in the Millennium Declaration , especially all that relates to combating poverty , open up opportunities and prospects for a phase during which the international community can move forward with its actions based on the necessary linkages between equity and worldwide social justice , putting into effect the principle of solidarity which is imperative for building the new society of tomorrow .  
Underlining the importance of the World Summit on Sustainable Development 24 / to be held in 2002 to review the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , to reinvigorate the global commitment to sustainable development and , as a critical opportunity to advance international cooperation for sustainable development on the basis of concrete commitments at the highest level ,  
First , the United Nations would convene a meeting , at a venue to be determined , of representatives of the Northern Alliance and existing processes later complemented by representatives of other groups to ensure fair representation for all parts of Afghan society to agree on a framework for the process of political transition .  Secondly , the meeting would suggest concrete steps for the convening of a provisional council , which would be composed of a fairly large and representative group of Afghans drawn from all ethnic and regional communities .  
Were the Council to fail to effectively assume its responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security or to contain the volatile situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , we fear that , given the inability of the other parties to achieve concrete progress in prevailing upon the Israeli Government to accept steps that would lead to a political solution , the situation would become yet more tense and would get completely out of control , having a very negative impact on the stability of this vital part of our world .  
The year 2004 could be seen as a target year by which time concrete progress should have been made in the identification and elaboration of issues of direct concern to families and in the provision of practical guidelines for national , regional and global actions as part of a sustained long-term effort to strengthen the economic and sustainable livelihood of families .  
Companies participating in the Compact have committed themselves to expressing their support publicly for the Compact and its principles in mission statements , annual reports and public announcements , engaging in dialogue with the United Nations and other partners , sharing concrete examples of progress made or lessons learned in implementing the principles of the Compact and undertaking activities jointly with the United Nations that advance the implementation of those principles or support wider goals such as poverty eradication .  
The importance that regional workshops undertaken within the Framework be accompanied by concrete and sustainable subregional and national activities , as well as by training and awareness programmes for government officials and key professional groups such as the police , prison officials , educators , judges , lawyers , and parliamentarians , was also recognized .  
Draws the attention of all States to the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , 2 signed at the High-level Political Signing Conference held in Palermo , Italy , from 12 to 15 December 2000 , and of the protocols thereto , 3 , 4 which strengthen the countermeasures against transnational organized crime by , inter alia , providing a concrete basis for international cooperation and for effective law enforcement action to deal in an integrated manner with all interrelated aspects of illicit trafficking ;  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
The ongoing efforts at the country level by the UN system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help LDCs translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide a unique process to promote an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
Urges the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries , with a view to making concrete recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Invites States to take legislative , administrative , legal and other steps , including when a state of emergency has been declared , to take action at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations , if appropriate through technical assistance , and to provide the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in preventing enforced , involuntary or arbitrary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ;  
The Commission recalls the commitment of the Government of Indonesia to ensure that the violations of human rights and humanitarian law committed during the violence in 1999 are accounted for and welcomes in this context the concrete steps already taken by the Government of Indonesia , including the efforts by the Attorney-General of Indonesia to investigate fully the violations of human rights and international and humanitarian law perpetrated in East Timor in the period leading up to and immediately following the popular consultation held in August 1999 .  
The meeting had been inconclusive , however , and the Personal Envoy had called upon the parties to come forward at a meeting to be held in June , with concrete solutions to the multiple problems of the settlement plan that the parties could agree to , or else be prepared to consider and discuss other ways to achieve an early , durable and agreed resolution of their dispute over Western Sahara .  
It will be extremely important to maintain high-level involvement , to translate the momentum created by the success of the UNDP ministerial meeting into a sustained process of engagement at the political level around MYFF that ensures the concrete rebuilding of political and financial support for a strong role for the United Nations in development in general and for a better funded UNDP .  
Requests the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions and other relevant multilateral institutions to take further concrete measures to systematically integrate the use of the modalities of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries into their regular cooperation programmes in line with the new directions strategy with a view to support their effective implementation ;  
The Commission also called for the condemnation of all forms of racism and racial discrimination , and for concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields , through improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services , in order to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights for all women and girls .  
Regrets that despite section V , paragraph 19 , of its resolution 53 / 221 and according to paragraph 52 of the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services of the Secretariat on the follow-up audit of the recruitment process in the Office of Human Resources Management , [ 5 ] some programme managers are still reluctant to recruit candidates selected through national competitive examinations , leaving many P-2 posts vacant , and requests the Secretary-General to take concrete measures to fill those posts expeditiously from the existing roster of successful candidates ;

While the need for effective forward planning of purchases was recognized , it was decided that the fluid nature of many of the projects , which evolve as research progresses , makes concrete planning of purchases on a universal level extremely difficult .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Urges States to take concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields through , inter alia , improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
Each regional commission is expected to select five eminent persons from its region from a cross-section of stakeholders , including experts from Governments , research institutions and the private sector , in their personal capacities , with a view to developing ideas for concrete initiatives from regional and subregional perspectives within the framework and in support of the substantive agenda of the Conference .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;

Cuba believes that the lack of political will on the part of a significant number of developed countries and their decision to protect the unjust foundations of the current international economic order have been the determining factors in the lack of concrete progress in the work of the Group .  
He also agreed with the call for the establishment of concrete provisions relating to special and differential treatment and to provide developing countries with technical assistance to allow them to meet their legitimate needs , such as rural development and food security .  
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
The representative of Brazil stated that for Brazil , a transit country for Paraguay and Bolivia , needed concrete proposals for the creation of innovative financial instruments of the national , regional and international levels , by financial institutions operating in the region .  
The fact that , in addition to the intergovernmental track focusing on the formulation of the new Programme of Action , it included a country-level track to prepare national-level programmes of action for individual least developed countries , an early deliverables thematic track leading to specific actions and initiatives for immediate implementation , and a civil society track , including the NGO forum , facilitated the launching of several important and concrete initiatives in the context of what was called the deliverables .  
While it was recognized that the primary responsibility for development in least developed countries rested with the least developed countries themselves , the Brussels Declaration acknowledged that their efforts needed to be given concrete and substantial international support from Governments and international organizations in a spirit of shared responsibility through genuine partnerships , inter alia , with the civil society and the private sector .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
Just prior to the Conference , the Ministers of the least developed countries met in Brussels on 13 May 2001 and adopted a Declaration21 in which they stressed that while the primary responsibility for the development of least developed countries rested with these countries themselves , the amelioration of the worsening social economic conditions in the least developed countries required , among other things , substantial and concrete international support measures . 
With regard to other multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , it is advised that the smaller core panel of experts should work closely with the respective subsidiary scientific bodies of MEAs , in particular with the Climate Change and Biodiversity conventions , in identifying concrete items for the joint programmes of work .  
He stated that LDC-III had provided a good opportunity to review the daunting development crisis in LDCs and that the Conference recognized LDCs critical need for concrete support from the developed countries in terms of resources for development , debt relief , enhanced market access for their products and increased FDI , among other things .  
In response , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD expressed some scepticism about the prospects for achieving concrete results at the conference on specific aspects of issues such as trade , ODA , and FDI , since these were all being discussed in other multilateral fora or were covered under actions at regional , bilateral and national levels ; any decision would have to be coordinated with those discussions .  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information , including the possible establishment of a database for research and analysis , and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
While the primary responsibility for development in the least developed countries rested with those countries themselves , their efforts must be supplemented by concrete and substantial support from the international community , in a spirit of shared responsibility and genuine partnership which included civil society and the private sector .  
Take concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields , through , inter alia , improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights for all women and girls ;

As they entered the farm , Chang Chih-man led his bride-to-be to the front of a grave . The tombstone could not be considered grandiose and was made of gray stone slabs and concrete . Carved on its surface was the inscription , " Tomb of the misfortunate father and sons Chang Chi-lang , Tsung-jen and Kuo-jen who unjustly met their deaths on the night of 4 April , 1947 . " The parallel verses to each side read : " Two sons as companions ; Patriotic fervor floods the plains beyond the town . "  
The more powerful the backwave , the faster the base will be washed away .

In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations .

Chang Chin-un , a designer and consultant for several large hospitals and president of the Hospital Association of the Republic of China , points out a direction which is concrete . Group-practice clinics should be established to draw in patients with a stronger line-up of physicians and advanced equipment , as well as striking up a cooperative relationship with large hospitals , further strengthening a bi lateral referral system .

Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness .

It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture .

To the immediate right are densely packed grey residential buildings and high-rises in the downtown . Electrical power stations and petrochemical and metal industry plants are crowded along the coast and the Kaoping River . Oil tanks , incinerator towers , and smokestacks look like pillars to a wall surrounding the city . To the left is a low mountain , which has been half shaved away for material to make concrete ; bald and grey , it has an eerie appearance .  
This knowledge might have been fragmentary and far from concrete , but it certainly conveyed the stress on the imitation of nature and the mastery of the untrammeled principles of its creation .

Governments should be encouraged to make earmarked funds available for specific short-term and long-term activities designed to promote significant progress toward elimination of violence against women through an upgraded and more effective criminal justice system that ensures fair treatment , and that achieves concrete results by means of rigorous needs assessments and evaluations . 
In accordance with the " precautionary principle " , the Committee , in the draft resolution recommended for adoption by the Economic and Social Council , identified a number of concrete steps at the global level which could assist in the management of mineral resources and of environmental impacts during the period of transition to more sustainable consumption patterns .

Provided the heightened international political attention to the plight of the fragile ecosystems of drylands translates into political commitment and action at the national level , concrete , local action has the potential to become effective and transformative .  
But beyond those concrete achievements , the fact that all the Council 's decisions have been adopted by consensus , that all the Commissioners have also been appointed by consensus and that all their recommendations are unanimous and also approved by the Council by consensus , always without a vote , gives the Commission outstanding legal , political and moral authority . 
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;

The hostile actions of the United States represent a concrete example of organized State terrorism being committed against the people of Iraq by a major Power without regard for the humanitarian and material consequences that such illegal and unlawful actions may entail .  
It recently took concrete form , as everyone knows , through the freezing of the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron , the refusal to resume negotiations on the final situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , the return to the policy of settlements , the blocking off of the Palestinian territories , the confiscation of Arab lands and the collective economic sanctions and daily acts of violence against the unarmed civilian population .  
They are , rather , the direct result of a long-term and focused plan of action that took concrete and unmistakable shape following the assumption of power by the new Israeli Government , which is pursuing an aggressive expansionist policy in violation of the agreements concluded by the former Government of Israel .  
The Special Rapporteur repeats that no peace worthy of the name can be established in Burundi unless an equitable solution is found to the above-mentioned problem , a solution that provides strong guarantees to the minority once and for all , ensures respect for democracy and leads , at last , to a real sharing of power on concrete and realistic bases , so that the tremendous social and economic inequalities that continue to beset Burundi society may be overcome .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated their support for the convening , in 1998 , of a special session of the General Assembly dedicated to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and drug-related offences , from which new strategies should arise to tackle in an integral manner the problem of illegal drugs , and concrete mechanisms should be formulated for international cooperation for the fight against that phenomenon .  
In his message , the Secretary-General pointed out that the International Decade promotes concrete action in such vital areas as human rights , protection of the environment and access to health and education - areas in which indigenous people must be actively involved ; and also referred to the efforts the United Nations system can make to enhance international cooperation and understanding on issues of central concern to the world 's indigenous people .

In order to better review the promotion and practical realization of the Declaration , the Working Group decided to collect information on the constitutions and legislation of States in respect of the protection and promotion of the rights of minorities , and to commission the preparation of short studies on the content and scope of the core principles contained in the Declaration , including the formulation of specific and concrete recommendations for their application in different countries and regions of the world .  
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .

Instead , as can be seen in the conclusions that form the annex to the draft resolution submitted to the Assembly , the Working Groups identified selected areas in which to carry out a fair and impartial assessment of achievements over the past five years , and produced concrete and realistic recommendations to be implemented through cooperation and partnership among all the parties concerned .  
It is also important to set the ways and means to achieve this by utilizing not only official development assistance but also private investment , trade , social infrastructure building , human capacity development , and all other elements which are essential to achieving those targets , as well as by devising an ideal policy mix to suit the concrete socio-economic conditions of the countries involved .

Technical support and cooperation are provided in order to yield concrete results , with special attention being devoted to human resource development and institution-building designed to contribute better to the efforts of recipient countries to create an overall enabling environment at a policy and institutional level .  
Procedures for developing the Unit 's programme of work will ensure that the items chosen are of major interest to Member States and constitute a direct response to the General Assembly 's request to JIU to continue focusing its reports on important priority items and identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing it and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations .  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;

Notes that further progress , including new and concrete measures and swift implementation of innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
For the LDCs to reap the full potential benefit of the Uruguay Round Agreements , concrete and positive action should be directed at two broad areas : measures to overcome , or at least ameliorate , structural weaknesses of the LDCs in order to enhance their trade performance ; and effective implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements , and the expeditious implementation of the S &amp; amp ; D provisions and the Decisions on Measures in Favour of LDCs as well as consideration of further S &amp; amp ; D treatment .

Panama recommends the inclusion of provisions , as very special legislation , that are directed at committing States to social policy allocating greater budgetary resources to finance institutions for the physical and psychological rehabilitation of children who are victims of armed conflicts , and supports efforts to implement State social policy giving concrete form to the real will of Governments . Sixth .  
The Panel agreed that [ existing or any future body of ] [ any future ] international forest-related legal mechanism [ s ] must deal cohesively with all the interrelated social , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues and have a concrete impact on the future successful implementation of [ sustainable forest management ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] worldwide .  
With the improvement of the international political climate , the dangers posed by nuclear war and the arms race are receding , while prospects for taking concrete steps on practical disarmament are improving .  
The shared effort to build a culture of peace in the region has changed from an academic discussion to a fact of everyday life , in which we are promoting and fostering the concrete values of peace : tolerance , respect for human rights , solidarity , social justice and the rejection of violence as a method of resolving social or any other type of conflicts , all elements that are contributing to the integral development of our peoples .  
And for peace to be truly meaningful it must also be translated into concrete improvements in the living conditions of the long-suffering Palestinian people ; hence , there is an urgent need for economic , financial and technical assistance by the international community .  
In the light of existing realities in the disarmament process , in which international instruments are still under discussion and various questions are under negotiation , my delegation recommends allocating more time for concrete measures to be implemented in this area and suggests that it would be convenient to postpone the date of the fourth special session devoted to disarmament to a later time , perhaps until the year 2000 .  
The four specific action areas laid out in the mission statement - operational assistance , advancement of understanding of the issues , encouragement of social and economic development through migration , and upholding the human dignity and well-being of migrants - permeate the Programme of Action , too , and provide a solid basis for IOM 's institutional commitment to moving the international consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development towards concrete action .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals clearly set out by the Conference , the mobilization of resources must be placed high on the global development agenda , and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
With a view to finding durable and concrete solutions to the problem of the sale and commercial sexual exploitation of children , the Special Rapporteur is making an urgent appeal to Governments , non-governmental organizations , and all concerned agencies and individuals , to keep her informed on a regular and sustained basis of developments in matters under her mandate , including specific situations of child abuse in any country .  
Taking measures - no matter how good they may be - will not suffice ; such measures must be backed by concrete actions demonstrating the political will to crush all discrimination and to improve the study conditions of students and the living conditions of teachers , especially in this transitional period of declining teaching quality and school attendance , as well as of failure to recognize the importance of the teacher 's function ( the level of remuneration is so low that many are abandoning that noble profession ) .  
The Special Rapporteur ventures to remind them that there can be no lasting peace in Burundi until an equitable solution is found to the crucial problem of power _ sharing between the minority and majority on a concrete and realistic basis , providing the minority with sound and genuine guarantees and ensuring that the rights of the majority are firmly respected , in order to overcome the deep _ rooted socio _ economic inequalities from which Burundi society continues to suffer .  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
The Panel recognized that institutional needs include the strengthening of existing national research institutions ; subregional and regional networks ; joint research ventures ; approaches to enhancing and strengthening existing international , regional , subregional and national forest research institutions ' participation in an international network dedicated to the conservation and sustainable development , management and utilization of forests and forest policy research ; and the creation of appropriate mechanisms that could enable research findings to reach policy and field levels more effectively and could support concrete action .  
The Panel agreed that in order to achieve the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests it is necessary to deal coherently with all the interrelated social , cultural , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues that have a concrete impact on those objectives .  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , with a view to enabling the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
Before proceeding to the concrete facts that will serve as evidence of flagrant violation by the separatists of the norms of international humanitarian law , it is necessary to consider the issue as to whether the " ethnic cleansing " referred to in the above-mentioned documents and as it is being pursued in Abkhazia can be considered a crime against humanity and a form of genocide , since upon that depends the appropriateness of raising the question of bringing the accused to trial before an international tribunal .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
Pressure for " concrete " results is observed and behavioural models are sought among " profit-making " enterprises without there necessarily being any understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of the processes of human and community development , which by definition cover a more prolonged timespan .  
It recommended a profound judicial reform that would give the judicial system the capacity to sanction violations of human rights ; constitutional reforms in a number of areas ; the strengthening of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights ; the adoption of reforms in the armed forces and in the public security sector ; the investigation of illegal armed groups , or death squads ; and concrete measures to achieve national reconciliation .  
The permanent reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life extends well beyond successful disarmament and is determined by whether or not there exist concrete , long-term options for obtaining a sustainable livelihood and participating in the social and political life of the country .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung took the landmark initiative of demolishing the concrete walls built up on the south side of the military demarcation line , allowing free travel between the north and the south , and holding north-south high-level talks and the north-south summit talks to remove the root cause of the war and accelerate the process of peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula in the next few years .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Similarly , the international community 's assertions of true partnership with Africa in the face of failing official development assistance and impossible debt repayments to mention just two major constraints may soon sound hollow unless that partnership manifests itself in concrete programmes of action .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
These measures are intrinsically linked to the just and lasting resolution of conflicts , the peaceful settlement of disputes , concrete and effective measures of disarmament through the accession of all the States of the region to the multinational agreements on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction ( the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Chemical Weapons Convention , the Biological Weapons Convention , etc . ) , and to the placement of all nuclear installations under international control .  
While these developments are not in themselves sufficient to dispel our anxieties about the safety of our planet from the threat of weapons of mass destruction , we should seize the moment and take concrete steps to consolidate the limited gains that have been realized , and move to resolve the outstanding disagreements which have stalled initiatives to find lasting solutions to fundamental disarmament issues .  
Furthermore , this is a concrete , effective security mechanism that is relatively easy to implement and helps avoid misunderstandings and errors while fostering in-depth , constructive dialogue that enhances mutual understanding and alerts the international community to the excessive stockpiling of weapons .  
It was realistic in that it focused on concrete partnerships and practical solutions , and would tap the human , technological and financial resources which had been beyond the reach of the United Nations , and which had become far greater than official development assistance .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
In paragraph 12 of the same resolution , the General Assembly requested the Unit to continue to focus its reports on important priority items , identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing the Assembly and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations on precisely defined issues .  
By eliminating the world 's third biggest nuclear arms stock , and by recently signing a number of basic bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the charter on special partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , Ukraine has made an essential contribution to strengthening European and world security , thus having a concrete input in implementing the lofty goals enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce . 
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
In this spirit , the United Nations must look for the best ways and means to make its activities in the area of social development more effective , including by strengthening coordination between economic and social activities and improving coordination with international financial institutions , since only through concrete and pragmatic programmes can our Organization get more out of the aid and assistance it provides to States for the establishment of social policies .  
Such reaffirmation of the international community \ x { e5b8 } interest in recognizing and consolidating linguistic diversity should at the same time be accompanied by concrete acts and daily gestures to ensure a harmonious , mutually beneficial and fruitful coexistence among all cultures .  
The sponsors are submitting these three draft resolutions driven by a strong desire that the Organization should make a further concrete and constructive contribution to the multiplicity of efforts bilateral , multilateral or undertaken by individuals or by Governments aimed at bringing about a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine .  
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
We believe that measures aimed at curbing mines should be accompanied by serious and concrete steps geared towards mine clearance in affected countries that are unable to achieve that objective on their own , by providing technical and financial support and through the transfer of necessary advanced technology to enable these States to overcome this tragic legacy . 
The European Union expects the Disarmament Commission to live up to expectations , and looks forward to working in a constructive and balanced manner in the coming weeks towards concrete results to guide future multilateral disarmament efforts . 
At its fifty _ second session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1996 / 15 , reaffirmed that the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development required perseverance and concrete efforts and that that dynamic process should be pursued at all appropriate levels , including through the elaboration of international and national strategies , which required the effective contribution of States , organs and organizations of the United Nations system and of non-governmental organizations active in that field .  
Although no concrete data are available , there is overall recognition that the level of technology and technology-related investments from public and private sources in developed countries directed to developing countries has not , in general , been realized as envisaged at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
In the context which I have just outlined , my country believes that the best chance we have here today to begin work which can produce rapid and concrete results which are understandable and expected by the entire international community lies in establishing as soon as possible an ad hoc committee to negotiate a comprehensive ban on anti _ personnel mines by means of a step _ by _ step approach .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .

In resolution 42 / 169 of 11 December 1987 , the General Assembly , " convinced that concerted international action for the reduction of natural disasters over the course of the 1990s would give genuine impetus to a series of concrete measures " decided to designate the 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction .  
The development of " a concrete proposal for an effective international mechanism on early warning , to include the transfer of technologies related to early warning to developing countries " requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 50 / 117 B of 20 December 1995 , is just one specialized form of the comprehensive information management responsibility assigned to the Decade secretariat .  
Many of those interviewed by the Central Evaluation Unit stated that background papers and proposals for policy decisions were usually distributed too late , and as a result agency representatives often did not come to the meetings prepared to act on proposals ; many meetings had been convened with no concrete objectives set ; and work initiated by the Working Group on specific issues had been pursued in an on-and-off fashion , only reaching conclusion three to four years after initiation .  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , to enable the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
The agreed conclusions adopted on women and the environment focused on mainstreaming a gender perspective , translating it into concrete actions and moving beyond the concept of women as a major group . 4 For example , all actors at the international level were requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrate a gender perspective into sustainable development and to apply a gender perspective in all funding programmes for sustainable development , while acknowledging the importance of continuing programming targeted at women . 
In his paper , Mr . Alfredsson suggested that better use should be made of international and bilateral technical cooperation programmes with a view to enhancing respect for minority rights at the domestic level ; that the Working Group should show , using concrete examples , that dialogue and technical cooperation could be effective mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution ; that the Working Group might encourage research on topics of particular relevance to its mandate and ensure that the guidelines on State reporting addressed minority concerns .

In paragraph 3 of the same resolution , the Assembly also invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with their views on ( a ) effective ways and means of collecting weapons transferred illicitly , in particular in the light of experience gained by the United Nations ; and ( b ) concrete proposals concerning measures at national , regional and international levels to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms .  
They had also pointed out that total compliance with the principle of shared responsibility ought produce more concrete results and a global and balanced view of the drugs problem which would facilitate the coordination of activities at the national , regional and world level in conformity with the principles of international law .  
That would be a fitting occasion for the submission of concrete proposals for ensuring that the new models of international cooperation would be translated effectively into reality , enabling sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
Some countries were still suffering from the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , particularly with regard to health and educational infrastructure and services , which necessitated strengthening of international cooperation based on the adoption and implementation of concrete measures aimed at mitigating and completely eliminating their adverse impact .  
By this all or nothing approach practised in the CD this year , concrete progress on specific and timely issues , issues ripe for multilateral negotiation , was held hostage to demands for an agreement to negotiate multilaterally nuclear disarmament in a time _ bound framework .  
That consensus had found concrete expression in the declarations and programmes of action of the major United Nations conferences , the themes of which - economic growth , the environment , population , human rights , social development , the advancement of women and human settlements - now should be articulated in the agenda for development , a fundamental document which should guide development worldwide on the eve of the twenty-first century .  
In addition , the conversion of policy declarations into concrete policies and actions at both the national and the international levels required not only political will but also adequate allocations of financial and human resources .  
The Inter-Parliamentary Union continued to provide strong and concrete support to the major international conferences or summit conferences organized by the United Nations to address issues relating to sustainable economic and social development .  
If indeed there is a genuine desire to prevent humanitarian disaster or to avoid costly peacekeeping operations and peacemaking efforts , then comprehensive , concerted and concrete action on economic development cooperation must be taken .

The lack of political commitment was also identified by a few responses , leading to protracted , artificial and unnecessary international negotiations without any concrete results , especially at the field level .  
In its resolution 50 / 233 of 7 June 1996 , the General Assembly requested the Joint Inspection Unit to continue to focus its reports on important priority items , identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing the Assembly and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations on precisely defined issues .

The Peruvian Government , for its part , considered that the World Conference should formulate concrete recommendations making it possible to increase the effectiveness of existing machinery used to combat racial discrimination and to adopt additional measures at the national , regional and international levels to strengthen those already in place .  
As for concrete recommendations to combat racial discrimination at the international level , the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that the promotion of genuine dialogue , mutual understanding , a culture of tolerance , and enhanced cooperation and participation would contribute to the gradual realization of a global civil society in which the phenomena of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia are doomed to complete eradication . 
When the General Assembly had adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 , the Governments of the region had felt confident that they would take concrete measures to reduce high infant and maternal mortality rates and severe malnutrition and to provide universal access to basic education , health and safe drinking water .  That had not happened , however , and most Governments , particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa , had fallen far short of the goals set for the year 2000 .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the note by the Secretariat on the review of the status of the five international legal instruments governing outer space ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 210 and Add . 1 ) contained valuable analyses of and concrete proposals on the elimination of obstacles preventing the universal acceptance of the five international legal instruments governing outer space that warranted further consideration .

From my perspective as a former President of the CD , I am inclined more and more to consider the Presidential troika mechanism as a tool in resolving complicated procedural issues , such as the establishment of a subsidiary body , as exemplified by its activities last year , and not as suitable for the conduct of regular discussions on one concrete issue and its set of closely related aspects .

Both the training sessions and the Symposium featured a lively exchange of views , further development of the training materials for local use and concrete first steps towards creating a dynamic knowledge base on these issues within the PA public and private sectors .  
The success of the review of the mechanisms can best be judged by achieving such a balance through concrete proposals , such as assigning equal budgetary and human resources to both civil and political and to economic , social and cultural rights .  
Her delegation was disappointed that the " Issues for consideration " document provided few pragmatic and concrete recommendations on the role that international cooperation could play in building up physical infrastructure in the transport sector , and no concrete suggestion had been put forward on how to strengthen and improve international cooperation , particularly in improving financial resource availability for transport infrastructure development .

In canton 6 , based on a full operational review of the Ministry of Interior and all municipal police administrations , UNMIBH has developed a " three-point plan " of concrete steps for the creation of a multi-ethnic , fully integrated professional police force , which is insulated from inappropriate external influences .  
The executive bodies of the various nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties constitute concrete examples of existing regional arrangements , but their capabilities need to be augmented and their political role needs to be acknowledged by the international community .  
We look forward to starting the preparation for the summit , which should adopt a balanced approach between political and economic issues , reflecting the global nature of European Union-Africa partnership in order to ensure concrete results . 
At the start of a new millennium , therefore , a fundamental challenge for the international community is to enhance the coherence and consistency of macroeconomic policies at the intergovernmental level and at the level of international institutions , as well as to implement concrete measures and initiatives designed to secure the integration of developing countries into the globalizing world economy on an equitable basis .  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information and a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
Taking note of the Sarajevo Summit Declaration , in which the participants affirm their collective and individual readiness to give concrete meaning to the Pact by promoting political and economic reforms , development and enhanced security in the region and also their commitment to make every effort to assist countries in the region to make speedy and measurable progress along this road ,  
This could be achieved if the international community would : recognize the special situation and needs of African countries , particularly supply constraints ; apply differential treatment in favour of developing countries , including small and vulnerable economies , in a concrete and comprehensive fashion ; and remove all barriers facing the trade of African countries , in particular of the least developed countries .

Calls upon all States to translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urges them , inter alia , to immediately eliminate the worst forms of child labour as set out in the new International Labour Organization Convention No .  182 ;  
The Governing Council session had given concrete support to the integrated work programme of UNEP , which was based on five areas of concentration environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning , enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; freshwater ; technology transfer in industry ; and support to Africa and had endorsed its new functional organizational structure .  
Being the most obvious concrete public organization to hold accountable for the consequences of the otherwise acephalous international trading system creates an obvious potential for political discomfort .  
Also calls upon all States to translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urges them , inter alia , to immediately eliminate the worst forms of child labour as set out in the new International Labour Organization Convention No .  182 ;  
Notes , in particular , Governing Council decision 20 / 31 of 4 February 1999 , entitled Proposed programme budget of the United Nations Environment Programme : revised requirements for the biennium 1998-1999 and proposed requirements for the biennium 2000-2001 , which gives concrete support to the integrated work programme of the Programme and endorsement of its new functional organizational structure , and anticipates an increased level of funding to the Environment Fund for the biennium 2000-2001 ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
So the systemic contest was founded on a similar set of proclaimed values or objectives : rationality , efficiency and equity on a general level , and modernization , growth and an improved living standard for the majority on a more concrete level .  
In its resolution 1999 / 52 , the Commission decided to re-establish the open-ended inter-sessional ad hoc working group established in accordance with resolution 1998 / 20 to meet for eight working days prior to the fifty-sixth session of the Commission , and requested the working group to submit , with a view to completing its task , one or more concrete proposals on the establishment of a permanent forum for consideration by the Commission at that session .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
An internationally concerted framework for improving early warning by developing concrete proposals for an effective international mechanism , including the transfer of technology to developing countries , under the auspices of the United Nations as part of the implementation of related actions of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , should be established .  
In this context , my delegation would like to point out the necessity of strict observance by all the Member States of the World Summit decisions , which assigned concrete tasks and defined common approaches towards ensuring further social progress and improving the living conditions of the people of the world .  
This , however , has not prevented us from taking concrete steps that demonstrate our clear desire for peace and general and complete disarmament , as well as demonstrating the transparency and peaceful nature of the nuclear programme we are developing.I have the honour to report to the plenary Assembly that last month Cuba signed a protocol additional to the safeguards agreements that it entered into on a voluntary basis with the IAEA .  
The international community has paid close attention to the protection of national cultural property and established concrete norms of international law in the area of preserving the cultural property of nations through relevant international treaties and conventions .  
We will strengthen the dialogue with the OAU and subregional organizations on concrete possibilities for backing their efforts , inter alia in the fields of early warning , preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and of awareness of the importance of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , the rule of law , a pluralist society , democratic institutions and practices , and a culture of tolerance .  
This clearly shows how we intend to move forward in our future efforts and that we are serious about seeking to complement social and economic policy with sustainable development initiatives.A concrete proposal which we are currently pursuing is the idea that the outer island health centres should have solar-power electricity .  
He also described my countrys vision of the future in the light of the architecture of the current international system , and he formulated some concrete proposals to further the search for solutions to the many grave problems facing humanity , now and in the future , particularly the dilemma of the developing countries .  
From the practice of other international human rights treaty bodies , it is evident to the Netherlands delegation that the admissibility criteria contained in article 4 , paragraph 2 , subparagraph iii ( manifestly ill-founded or not sufficiently substantiated ) are concrete illustrations of the general admissibility criterion contained in article 4 , paragraph 2 , subparagraph ii , which provides that a communication should be compatible with the provisions of the Convention .  
This is also true for the more general subject of transparency in conventional weapons , where we consider the Conference can and must complete the valuable work accomplished by the Ad Hoc Committee established between the years 1992 and 1995 , to define concrete measures likely to increase confidence amongst States and strengthen international security .  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
The key to this success was the fact that ( 1 ) the Summit was organized around a number of very concrete developmental problems which affected major aspects of the development process and ( 2 ) a common interest between UNCTAD and non-governmental actors had been clearly identified in advance .  
While the deliberative process is still ongoing , the greater understanding of the implications of environmental protection for the sustainability of socio-economic development and for the improvement of the quality of life has induced concrete actions in small island developing States to begin the implementation of the Programme of Action .  
In accordance with its original terms of reference , the Committee on Contributions should make concrete recommendations on the methodology for determining the scale of assessments , with a view to making it objective and equitable , and should take into account the problems of developing countries , such as their difficulties in earning foreign exchange and the economic strain of taking in refugees .  
Taking note of the Sarajevo Summit Declaration , in which the participants affirm their collective and individual readiness to give concrete meaning to the Pact by promoting political and economic reforms , development and enhanced security in the region and also their commitment to make every effort to assist countries in the region to make speedy and measurable progress along this road ,  
International cooperation to that end must be strengthened and the relevant international organizations must take concrete measures , such as technology transfer , financial support and scientific and technical training , in favour of the developing countries .  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information and a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
These visits offered valuable opportunities to discuss the political , legal and practical problems in affected areas , as well as requirements for concrete action at the international , regional and national levels .  
These problems are global , but they require specific strategies , concrete goals and committed action at the international , regional , national , local and individual levels .  
An eventual convention on fissile material should be a concrete step forward in the nuclear disarmament process and should not be limited to being just another instrument of selective nonproliferation .  
In conclusion , the representative emphasized Indias determined , concrete and sustained efforts to eliminate poverty and social disability and empower the poor and vulnerable .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
Although confidencebuilding measures whether they be military , political , economic , commercial , cultural or humanitarian are no substitute for concrete disarmament measures , they can play an important role in progress towards disarmament .  
A major concrete aim is to mobilize additional governmental and private resources , including professional knowledge , and financial and human resources , to address key rights issues for children and women .  
Nevertheless , we are aware that although budgetary allocations are vital , other factors are required in order for social policy to be effectively translated into concrete actions , into tangible , everyday wellbeing for the people .  
Declarations of commitment to the protection of human rights are only effective , and indeed meaningful , if they are backed by genuine political will and translated into concrete decisions and policies at the national level .  
A concrete ceiling for the total ERUs acquired from projects under Article 6 shall be defined in quantitative and qualitative terms based on equitable criteria .  
A concrete ceiling for the total ERUs acquired from projects under Article 6 shall be defined in quantitative and qualitative terms based on equitable criteria .  
The constructive role played by civil society organizations in raising public awareness on the issue of conflict diamonds , proposing practical solutions and helping generate the necessary political will required for concrete action .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors , including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
Accordingly , the highly concrete and humane goals embodied in the Millennium Declaration , especially all that relates to combating poverty , open up opportunities and prospects for a phase during which the international community can move forward with its actions based on the necessary linkages between equity and worldwide social justice , putting into effect the principle of solidarity which is imperative for building the new society of tomorrow .  
Underlining the importance of the World Summit on Sustainable Development 24 / to be held in 2002 to review the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , to reinvigorate the global commitment to sustainable development and , as a critical opportunity to advance international cooperation for sustainable development on the basis of concrete commitments at the highest level ,  
First , the United Nations would convene a meeting , at a venue to be determined , of representatives of the Northern Alliance and existing processes later complemented by representatives of other groups to ensure fair representation for all parts of Afghan society to agree on a framework for the process of political transition .  Secondly , the meeting would suggest concrete steps for the convening of a provisional council , which would be composed of a fairly large and representative group of Afghans drawn from all ethnic and regional communities .  
Were the Council to fail to effectively assume its responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security or to contain the volatile situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , we fear that , given the inability of the other parties to achieve concrete progress in prevailing upon the Israeli Government to accept steps that would lead to a political solution , the situation would become yet more tense and would get completely out of control , having a very negative impact on the stability of this vital part of our world .  
The year 2004 could be seen as a target year by which time concrete progress should have been made in the identification and elaboration of issues of direct concern to families and in the provision of practical guidelines for national , regional and global actions as part of a sustained long-term effort to strengthen the economic and sustainable livelihood of families .  
Companies participating in the Compact have committed themselves to expressing their support publicly for the Compact and its principles in mission statements , annual reports and public announcements , engaging in dialogue with the United Nations and other partners , sharing concrete examples of progress made or lessons learned in implementing the principles of the Compact and undertaking activities jointly with the United Nations that advance the implementation of those principles or support wider goals such as poverty eradication .  
The importance that regional workshops undertaken within the Framework be accompanied by concrete and sustainable subregional and national activities , as well as by training and awareness programmes for government officials and key professional groups such as the police , prison officials , educators , judges , lawyers , and parliamentarians , was also recognized .  
Draws the attention of all States to the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , 2 signed at the High-level Political Signing Conference held in Palermo , Italy , from 12 to 15 December 2000 , and of the protocols thereto , 3 , 4 which strengthen the countermeasures against transnational organized crime by , inter alia , providing a concrete basis for international cooperation and for effective law enforcement action to deal in an integrated manner with all interrelated aspects of illicit trafficking ;  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
The ongoing efforts at the country level by the UN system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help LDCs translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide a unique process to promote an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
Urges the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries , with a view to making concrete recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Invites States to take legislative , administrative , legal and other steps , including when a state of emergency has been declared , to take action at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations , if appropriate through technical assistance , and to provide the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in preventing enforced , involuntary or arbitrary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ;  
The Commission recalls the commitment of the Government of Indonesia to ensure that the violations of human rights and humanitarian law committed during the violence in 1999 are accounted for and welcomes in this context the concrete steps already taken by the Government of Indonesia , including the efforts by the Attorney-General of Indonesia to investigate fully the violations of human rights and international and humanitarian law perpetrated in East Timor in the period leading up to and immediately following the popular consultation held in August 1999 .  
The meeting had been inconclusive , however , and the Personal Envoy had called upon the parties to come forward at a meeting to be held in June , with concrete solutions to the multiple problems of the settlement plan that the parties could agree to , or else be prepared to consider and discuss other ways to achieve an early , durable and agreed resolution of their dispute over Western Sahara .  
It will be extremely important to maintain high-level involvement , to translate the momentum created by the success of the UNDP ministerial meeting into a sustained process of engagement at the political level around MYFF that ensures the concrete rebuilding of political and financial support for a strong role for the United Nations in development in general and for a better funded UNDP .  
Requests the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions and other relevant multilateral institutions to take further concrete measures to systematically integrate the use of the modalities of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries into their regular cooperation programmes in line with the new directions strategy with a view to support their effective implementation ;  
The Commission also called for the condemnation of all forms of racism and racial discrimination , and for concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields , through improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services , in order to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights for all women and girls .  
Regrets that despite section V , paragraph 19 , of its resolution 53 / 221 and according to paragraph 52 of the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services of the Secretariat on the follow-up audit of the recruitment process in the Office of Human Resources Management , [ 5 ] some programme managers are still reluctant to recruit candidates selected through national competitive examinations , leaving many P-2 posts vacant , and requests the Secretary-General to take concrete measures to fill those posts expeditiously from the existing roster of successful candidates ;

While the need for effective forward planning of purchases was recognized , it was decided that the fluid nature of many of the projects , which evolve as research progresses , makes concrete planning of purchases on a universal level extremely difficult .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Urges States to take concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields through , inter alia , improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
Each regional commission is expected to select five eminent persons from its region from a cross-section of stakeholders , including experts from Governments , research institutions and the private sector , in their personal capacities , with a view to developing ideas for concrete initiatives from regional and subregional perspectives within the framework and in support of the substantive agenda of the Conference .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Cuba believes that the lack of political will on the part of a significant number of developed countries and their decision to protect the unjust foundations of the current international economic order have been the determining factors in the lack of concrete progress in the work of the Group .  
He also agreed with the call for the establishment of concrete provisions relating to special and differential treatment and to provide developing countries with technical assistance to allow them to meet their legitimate needs , such as rural development and food security .  
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
The representative of Brazil stated that for Brazil , a transit country for Paraguay and Bolivia , needed concrete proposals for the creation of innovative financial instruments of the national , regional and international levels , by financial institutions operating in the region .  
The fact that , in addition to the intergovernmental track focusing on the formulation of the new Programme of Action , it included a country-level track to prepare national-level programmes of action for individual least developed countries , an early deliverables thematic track leading to specific actions and initiatives for immediate implementation , and a civil society track , including the NGO forum , facilitated the launching of several important and concrete initiatives in the context of what was called the deliverables .  
While it was recognized that the primary responsibility for development in least developed countries rested with the least developed countries themselves , the Brussels Declaration acknowledged that their efforts needed to be given concrete and substantial international support from Governments and international organizations in a spirit of shared responsibility through genuine partnerships , inter alia , with the civil society and the private sector .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
Just prior to the Conference , the Ministers of the least developed countries met in Brussels on 13 May 2001 and adopted a Declaration21 in which they stressed that while the primary responsibility for the development of least developed countries rested with these countries themselves , the amelioration of the worsening social economic conditions in the least developed countries required , among other things , substantial and concrete international support measures . 
With regard to other multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , it is advised that the smaller core panel of experts should work closely with the respective subsidiary scientific bodies of MEAs , in particular with the Climate Change and Biodiversity conventions , in identifying concrete items for the joint programmes of work .  
He stated that LDC-III had provided a good opportunity to review the daunting development crisis in LDCs and that the Conference recognized LDCs critical need for concrete support from the developed countries in terms of resources for development , debt relief , enhanced market access for their products and increased FDI , among other things .  
In response , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD expressed some scepticism about the prospects for achieving concrete results at the conference on specific aspects of issues such as trade , ODA , and FDI , since these were all being discussed in other multilateral fora or were covered under actions at regional , bilateral and national levels ; any decision would have to be coordinated with those discussions .  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information , including the possible establishment of a database for research and analysis , and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
While the primary responsibility for development in the least developed countries rested with those countries themselves , their efforts must be supplemented by concrete and substantial support from the international community , in a spirit of shared responsibility and genuine partnership which included civil society and the private sector .
