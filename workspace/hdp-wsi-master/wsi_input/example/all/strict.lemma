( 3 ) To streamline further the disciplinary proceedings and to remind in particular the officers at the management level to attach importance to the strict enforcement of the disciplinary actions to ensure that an effective reward and punishment system is maintained in the civil service and to prevent the reputation of the dedicated civil service from being tarnished by a few black sheep ; and
