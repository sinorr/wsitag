After the spring term begins , all middle and primary schools , education administrative departments and relevant organizations should publicize the government 's educational policy and the correct educational thinking and methods to the parents , exchange with them or introduce to them the experience of educating children scientifically , guide them to take a correct attitude toward education and know the true meaning of talent , and guide their eagerness to see their children succeed in life to the right direction .  
They are in the prime of life , have received a relatively high level of education , are relatively active in thinking , dare to forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and have done much hard work to implement the party 's line and central policy-decisions , and to promote socialist modernization .  However , it is also necessary to be aware that some clear weak points and shortcomings also exist among some cadres at this level .  
The " Program on Building Headquarters " upholds the guidance of Mao Zedong Military Thought , Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building during the new period , and a series of Jiang Zemin 's important expositions on army building ; is based on the military strategic principle in the new period ; and adopts the principle of building a quality army and strengthening the army with science and technology , thereby making a unified standard for comprehensive construction of our army 's headquarters .  
In the face of the strategic readjustment of the agricultural and rural economic structures , we should quickly change the ideas , concepts , leading methods , and the quality of cadres and the masses that are not compatible with the situation in structural readjustment and bring about a tremendous change in the way of thinking and working methods .  
Facing the new situations in domestic China and overseas and the new challenges of the new century and new millennium , it is a must to further define clearly the thinking about developing the economy , adjust in a timely manner the economic structure , and uphold all along the thinking of science and technology being the primary productive force , so as to bring about sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy .  
Some local authorities and departments and administrators do not have sufficient understanding of the danger of pirated audio-visual products .  They pay a lot more attention to wiping out pornographic publications than to cracking down on pirated goods .  Some local authorities are tolerant of pirated goods , thinking that they are harmless goods that the masses need and that keep pace with economic development .  
During the process of comprehensive pushing forward this great cause , only when people 's ideology reaches a desired high level can they cast off the shackles of outmoded concepts and an ossified way of thinking ; and gain a comprehensive and dialectical understanding of reform , development , and stability , so that they can display creativity and open up a new prospect in their work .  
Philosophy is an advanced form of theoretical thinking ; and is a fundamental stand , viewpoint , and method used by people for observing , understanding , and guiding both practice and scientific research .  
On 1 March , the Central Propaganda Department called a departmental affairs meeting to further study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , enhance understanding , seek unity of thinking , make thoroughgoing reflections in the light of the realities , work out concrete arrangements for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in its implementation of the directives of the central authorities , and to discuss a number of major issues which need to be resolved in the propaganda and ideological work during the country 's present cross-century development .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin sent a letter to the National Conference on Popularizing Science , pointing out : We must strengthen in real earnest the work of popularizing science by taking it as an important task aimed at implementing the strategy of " national rejuvenation through science and education " and as an important content of socialist spiritual civilization building ; should energetically popularize scientific knowledge in the whole society ; and should advocate the spirit of science ; publicize scientific thinking ; and disseminate scientific measures ;  
We should take seriously studying and all-round carrying out Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech as a turning point to launch widespread and profound studies and discussions among the Party Committees and governments at all levels and all related departments especially education departments as well as all social related parties .  We should deepen our understandings , unify the thinking and lay a good ideological foundation in order to carry out quality education , strengthen and promote educational work , and create a new situation of paying attention to the healthy growth of youths among the whole society .  
Guangdong , which is in the forefront of reform and opening up , must all the more enhance understanding of the importance of " grasping things with two hands , with both hands firm , " tangibly strengthen ideological and political work , and launch an extensive and thorough education drive to " think of the source when getting rich , and advance in thinking when getting rich . "  
It was based on such thinking that Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward the three-step strategic objective of our country 's modernization construction : from 1980 onwards , using 10 years to double gross national product so as to resolve the problem of food and clothing ;  
Sometimes , a disease is cured by chance .  It is simply because the illness is not so severe and the patient recovers without any medical treatment due to the fact that he still has a natural resistant power in himself .  In ancient times , people also had a wishful thinking to live a long life .  
Faced with the state 's grand development strategy , people in western regions must first of all develop their own line of thinking by completely changing their mindsets ; must avoid the erroneous zone of seeking expanded investment and more projects , of unplanned project startups , and of redundant construction , as characterized during the planned economy period ;  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
With reference to the new developments in situations at home and abroad , the new developments in productive forces and the new situations occurring in economic structural reform , the new requirements of the masses of people for their material and cultural life , and the new changes taking place within the contingents of party members and cadres under the new situation , we must earnestly study , deeply understand , and wholly and accurately master the spiritual essence of this important thinking .  
Deputy Li Changchun said : The policy decision on western development reflects Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of " two overall situations , " and is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demand , precipitating the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , promoting the coordinated economic development of various regions to ultimately achieve common prosperity , intensifying national unity , maintaining social stability , and solidifying national defense .  
[ Li Dingfan ] In the new century , the CNNC 's entire line of thinking on development is to further cut the new development path of " integrating military and civilian production , developing nuclear energy power generation , readjusting the structure , giving prominence to efficiency , strengthening management , and invigorating the nuclear industry with science and technology . "  
At present , party committees and governments at various levels in the central and western regions have come to fully realize their resources advantages for the development of tourism in their areas , and are unifying thinking and making greater determination to take the development of tourism as a major leading industry in the great development of China 's west by doing intensive and down-to-earth work .  
It has put forward the three anti-corruption work patterns of cadres ' honest self-governing , investigation and handling of cases of discipline violation and broken law , and redressing unhealthy tendencies in government and industry .  It has upheld the establishment of the two lines of defense of moral thinking and Party discipline and law , based on education and focused on keeping a lookout over the majority of Party members and cadres , and using strong legal standards for the small number of corrupt elements .  
It is necessary to make use of the existing funding channels , adjust the orientation of the input of funds and the thinking of building bases , strengthen dynamics in supporting agricultural construction projects in the western region , and focus attention on grasping the building of commodity grain , cotton and sugar-bearing crop production bases as well as dry-land crop and water-saving farming demonstration counties and pastoral area comprehensive development demonstration projects in the western region .  
In the past half a century and more , Comrade Chen Yun 's philosophical thinking has helped resolved many major party and state affairs .  This has not only won my respect and admiration , but it has also made me realize deeply that at that time I was able to understand only its " application " aspect and did not approach it from the level of world outlook and methodology .  My understanding of it was very superficial .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have all along adhered to the principle that " development is the last word , " always kept in mind Deng Xiaoping 's thinking that " poverty is not socialism , development at an overly slow speed is not socialism either ; the superiority of socialism should ultimately be embodied in the better development of productive forces " and , closely centering on the economic construction , achieved the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
The success of the exercise fully reflected the great achievements of the air force logistics system in seriously implementing Chairman Jiang Zemin 's strategic thinking on strengthening the army through science and technology , persisting in taking as their goal winning a high-tech local war , and actively launching mass science and technology training , closely centering on the focal and difficult points in logistics in actual combat .  
After watching the exercise , Chi Haotian said : The Air Force is a hi-tech service which fights decisive battles in the air but relies on ground support .  Without strong logistics support , the Air Force would be deprived of strong combat effectiveness .  Chi stressed and pointed out : Conducting scientific and technological training is a major measure for implementing Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong force through science and technology ;  
If the US Government could be introspective regarding their failure , it would not be difficult to discover that the politicizing of human rights is wishful thinking , and has already caused a lot of countries in the world , especially developing countries , to be strongly disapproving .  And it is also an obstacle to all kinds of economic development by the United Nations . This affects dialogue and cooperation about human rights between all member countries .  
By means of virtual reality , we can transform the future into the present as the direct subject of thinking and achieve the " seamless linkage " between the past , the present , and the future in the realm of thinking .  This brings the mode of thinking more in sync with the systematic , comprehensive , and multidimensional characteristics of military thinking .  
Today , with the reforms and opening to the outside , only when leading cadres at all levels possess noble values , strive to become pure people , noble people , people detached from base interests , people benefiting the people , thinking what the masses think , feeling the anxiety of the masses , suffering first , enjoying later , content to live an austere life , and having far-reaching ambitions , can they unite and lead the masses to approach common prosperity sooner .  
In upholding the new thinking of running schools with an open-minded spirit , we should make the following efforts : We should gear education of military academies toward society , dovetail it with the state 's higher education , learn from the reform experiences gained by local universities , extensively carry out cooperative exchanges , rely on the solid strength of local colleges and universities , and cultivate military officers through joint efforts made by military and civil sectors .  
This important thinking , with rich content , profound thought and prominent characteristics of the current era , being highly theoretical and practicable , is a new summary of the Party 's nature , of its essential principles and of its historic mission , is a new development in Marxist theory on Party construction and is a new requirement of the Party organizations and cadres at all levels in the new situation .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
The corrosive effects of decadent thinking and culture have particularly impeded the forming and establishment of a correct world outlook among officers and men , distorted some people 's outlook on life and concept of values as well as led to problems and deviation in moral quality and life pursuits among them .  
Around the two historic questions of how to " fight and win " and how one does " not become degenerate , " we now should emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , smash the trammels of outmoded ideas and the old way of thinking , earnestly study new situations and problems , and explore new ideas , new methods , and new ways to solve major practical problems in the armed forces in order to keep raising the level of army building .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
The General Staff , Political , and Logistics Departments and major military units held party committee and standing committee meetings on numerous occasions to study and grasp the important thinking .  The principal leaders of these departments and units were personally involved in the mobilization efforts and took the lead in discussing their personal experience and in attending lectures .  
Studying and understanding the important thinking of the Three Represents should be the key content in such study programs as Party committees central groups , theoretical learning programs for cadres ranked above regiment level and the education through Party 's lectures .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
The PLA General Political Department held a training course for the party secretaries of its directly subordinate units from 10 May to 15 June to conscientiously study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " .  The training course aimed to further improve the ideological level and the ability of leadership of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees , and to enhance the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the leading bodies of party committees .  
In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
The issues of belief and conviction involve many major issues including our guiding thought , social system , cadres ' contingent building , as well as people 's thinking that have a bearing on the rise and fall and success and failure of our party .  Faced with tough challenges in the new millenium , and at a time of comprehensively pushing forward our cause into the new century , we need a strong spiritual force even more .  
Leading cadres should take the lead in studying the " Three Represents " , should publicize and disseminate the " Three Represents " through their personal fruitful experiences , and should go deep down to the grassroots units , instructing them face to face , explaining the difficult points and unclear points , inspiring and guiding them , and assisting the Party members and broad numbers of officers and soldiers in grassroots units in their effectively studying and satisfactorily carrying out the important thinking of the " Three Represents " .  
Through education on " the importance of studying , being political minded and being honest and upright " and education on party style and discipline , we should help the broad masses of party members and cadres foster a correct world outlook and concept of life and value and firmly resist material gains and commercialization in their political life .  We should help them clarify their thinking and distinguish between right and wrong and constantly strengthen their ability to repel corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
We should combine that basis with the thinking of officers and men , carry out psychological adjustment education , provide guidance to officers and men to cultivate lofty ideals , for good mentality , for living well , and to help lay a solid ideological foundation for training " four haves " military personnel .  
The more distinct and stronger the main theme is , the more unified our thinking will be , the more closely our forces will be rallied , the more united our people will become , the more stable our society will be , the more smoothly our reforms will advance , and the greater guarantee we will provide for the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our economy .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
The core of Taiwan armed forces ' thinking of " decisive battle outside border " is : They will offer tenacious resistance on offshore islands , make timely landing raids on enemy shores , take advantage of the advanced performance of their main naval and air weapons to first impose war on the enemy , let war start on the enemy 's shore , and prevent war from reaching their own " doorstep " .  
We should take a strategic view of being responsible for the future of our military construction .  We should devote efforts to doing well the work of cultivating , using and improving college-graduate cadres .  We should change our thinking , make reasonable arrangements , and create the conditions so that they , in military construction , can make great achievements that are worthy of this great epoch .  
Treating young officers and solders in the new period , we must understand them with a high period feel and by breaking away from old thinking .  We should see from them their epochal spirit and positive factors , see more of their fine points and less of their shortcomings and see more about the innate character and less from the outside appearance .  Only in this way , can we truly carry out ideological and political work with a definite objective in view .  
The complexity of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that we are improving and developing the self-reform of the socialist system and the world is undergoing a profound change .  Against this background , people 's thinking has become lively ;  
The arduousness of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that international and domestic factors are complex and people 's thinking is lively , complex , varied , and constantly changeable from person to person , from matter to matter , and from time to time .  
Training for our army 's mechanized troops has entered a new phase because we have inspected our science-and-technology military training achievements in a " stage " of war that resembled modern war , and departed from previous " playacting " exercises that were based on wishful thinking .  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
They sought high-level and large projects , blindly scaled " heights " , and hankered for large projects and " modern methods " .  Some units focused their thinking on making achievements and exploring new spheres and neglected the mastery of existing equipment .  As a result , science-technology military training deviated from the track .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
We must study his noble character of being loyal to the party and the people , study his lofty spirit of seeking truth from facts and upholding the truth , and study his solid and strict style of work .  Under the leadership of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we must adhere to Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on foreign affairs , unflinchingly carry out the foreign policy of independence and peace , and further open up a new prospect for China 's diplomatic work .  
After the cold war ended , the U.S . military 's traditional opponent has gone out of existence .  Driven by its strategic need to assert sole hegemony over the globe with its " new cold-war thinking " and its narrow interest in expanding the increasingly shrinking survival space for military forces , the U.S . military has always been concocting a virtual opponent .  
Reform and opening up is a historical policy decision determining the fate of contemporary China . This great practice has not only greatly liberated and developed productive forces , but also greatly emancipated people 's minds , deeply transformed the mental outlook of the masses of people , and promoted the constant progress of social thinking .  
These changes will exert an extensive , profound and comprehensive influence on the military 's thinking , and challenge ideological and political education in fundamental and temporal ways .  
The military and citizens of the entire country have employed the important words of General Secretary Jiang Zemin to unify their thinking , with each blazing patriotic heart being transformed into a concrete action for supporting and sacrificing to national defense modernization .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
As long as we seek unity of thinking , have a firm grasp of the principal line of strategic economic structural adjustment , persist in doing a good job of economic structural adjustment in the course of development , and maintain the rapid development while making economic structural adjustment , we will certainly usher in a still more glorious and splendid future .  
They sufficiently respected , trusted and supported brigades and regiments in executing their rights for independently administering grassroots units , and allowed brigades and regiments to have leading roles in devoting efforts to grassroots units .  But some institutions above the level of division still adhere to traditional practices and outdated ways of thinking .  They believe that only when they promote a certain number of activities can they receive wide attention and only when they hold a certain number of meetings can they show their great concern .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
Only by following leap-forward thinking for development ; building informationalized units while informationalizing our units step by step at the same time ; and raising our country 's strategic deterrent and war deterrent will it be possible to provide reliable guarantee for fighting and winning a future hi-tech war .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .  
and opened up China 's future .  It was their great thinking , noble character , and immortal achievements that inspired us to carry forward the revolutionary cause pioneered by our predecessors and courageously forge ahead into the future .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents " pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party must become a true representative of the needs of developing China 's advanced social production forces , of the course of progressing China 's advanced culture , and of the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .  
During this centralized education , Party members and cadres in grassroots units meticulously studied the important thinking of the " three represents , " touched on and solved some problems that are incongruous with the needs of the Party 's advanced nature , improved their ideological conscientiousness , and inspired their revolutionary will to fight .  
The second generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at its core as well as the third generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core restored , upheld and advanced the ideological line of " emancipate one 's thinking , be practical and realistic " , and led the entire party and the entire Chinese people in concentrating efforts on reforms and opening to the outside world , such that China has been seeing miraculous economic and social growth .  
The resolution of key and difficult problems certainly does not lie in shouting slogans more loudly .  It lies in starting out with a recognition of reality , revolving around real problems of widespread concern to the broad masses of officers and soldiers , thinking of practical moves , taking real action , and working steadily and surely to solve the problems .  
All in all , to continuously accelerate reform and construction in the military and fulfill the sacred mission , the military must vigorously promote the spirit of emancipating their thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of closely following the development of the era and innovating courageously , the spirit of unswervingly marching forward despite difficulties , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness , and the spirit of disregarding personal fame and interests , being unselfish and dedicating oneself .  
Sun Yanling , a farmer at the outskirts of Bengbu City , Anhui , lost her life because she left her treatment of illness to " Falungong . "  According to statistics , obsessed by Li Hongzhi 's warped theories and heretical thinking , more than 1,600 people have died because of suicides or because they refused to be treated by a doctor for their illnesses ; 651 people have developed psychological problems ;  
In short , every division of the armed forces should like the Party Committee of the Air Force emancipate their thinking , update their conceptions and promote a reformative and innovative spirit by launching as many competitive policies and measures as possible so that the military will really become a " warm land " attracting the majority of China 's excellent scientific and technological specialists .  
In order to implement Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong army with science and technology and to fully mobilize enthusiasm and creativity of professional and technological cadres , with the approval of the Central Military Commission , the four general departments have jointly issued a circular on raising relevant treatment for some senior experts in our army as of this year .  
What stirred Peng Qin deeply at a later time was the moral lessons given by two former " Falungong " practitioners on the basis of their own experiences , whom the provincial reeducation-through-labor center had released before the due date .  Ever since then , Peng Qin started to calm down and do some serious thinking .  Little by little , she recalled the path that she had covered over the previous three years ;  
Not only has it been innovative in adopting new ideological concepts and modes of thinking in carrying out its domestic construction , it has also changed the isolationism of its past foreign policy , enthusiastically taking the initiative in developing relations with various countries .  
The thinking of " three represents , " with its profound meaning expressed in simple and concise language , is a new summary of the party 's nature , aim and fundamental tasks .  It is a new development of the Marxist theory of party building and a new requirement placed by the new situation on party organizations and party cadres at all levels .  It is also the root of the party , the foundation of the administration and the source of strength .  
Deputies Shi Yuxiao and Zhang Guochu held that today , facing the new task of regarding economic construction as the central task , the important thinking of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has given a highly refined interpretation in fundamentally answering the questions of how to build the party , what kind of party to build , and how to act well as the " force at the core " in leading the cause of socialist modernization in the new historical conditions .  
To continuously advance military construction and reform , fulfill the sacred mission placed on the shoulders of our military , we must carry forward the spirit of emancipating thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of keeping up with the times and courageously innovating , the spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness and the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career .  
Tang Dongcheng , known as the Defuser , has made some astounding achievements defusing bombs .  Being extremely responsible to the Party , to people and protecting the interests of others wholeheartedly is reflected in his excellence in defusing bombs .  He deserves our sincere respect and the honor of being selected as a model for practicing Chairman Jiang 's important thinking embodied in the " three represents . "  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has scientifically summed up the historical experiences of the world socialist movement and of our party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction , and creatively put forward the important thinking on " three represents , " thus answering in scientific fashion a series of major issues that we face in stepping up party building in the new situation .  
We should profoundly understand the great significance of studying , and practicing the important thinking on " three represents " from the level of " the foundation of building the party , the basis of ruling the country , and the source of strength , " vigorously step up ideological and political building , and ensure that the important thinking on " three represents " is truly implemented in building national defense and the armed forces .  
Deputy Guo Jinlong said : To implement the economic and social objectives set by the autonomous regional party committee for the coming five years , the cadres and people of all nationalities in Tibet will work hard in the six aspects : First , further break seclusion , improve service , and create a good investment soft environment with innovations in thinking and structure as the guide .  
Therefore , we must , through constant efforts , further liberalize thinking , renew ideas , expand efforts to open up to the outside , seize opportunities , and accelerate development so as to bring more visible and tangible benefits to the Tibetan people and increasingly improve the material and cultural standard of living for the people .  
Seize the opportunity created by global restructuring , speed up structural readjustment , effect the two fundamental changes , and maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  Such is the new thinking on economic development during the Tenth Five-Year Plan . It is the concrete expression of our intent to make development the keynote as well as a prominent feature of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo pointed out : The current education drive is an important move and practical step taken on the basis of positive education in " three stresses " carried out in party committees at the regimental level and grassroots units of the armed forces to further study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " , improve the quality of the ranks of party members , and strengthen party building in the armed forces .  
Therefore , our military 's attitude toward the recent international focus of topics on Aegis frigates is of a very low key , thinking the heated debate of this topic will not help Taiwan obtain the Aegis frigates .  Furthermore , the Ministry of National Defense indirectly expressed its hope that the domestic military media will lighten the report on this issue .  
The central authorities ' decision to carry out study and educational activities in rural areas throughout the country concerning the important thinking of the " three represents " is an important basic project to step up and improve the party 's leadership over rural work , to deepen rural reform , and boost rural economic and social development , as well as a strategic measure to step up the building of the work style of rural grass-roots cadres .  
Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .  
This Opinion regards Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " as the guideline , gives an eye on the reality of the party-building in the military and explicitly proposes the guiding principle , fundamental objective , major tasks and detailed requirements on extensively promoting throughout the military an educational campaign to maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
Hence , the whole process of this study and education drive must be based on arming the rural grassroots cadres with the important thinking on " three represents " ; in particular , it is essential to strengthen their concept of wholeheartedly serving the people , improve their ability to carry out agricultural restructuring and develop rural economy , strengthen their ability to do mass work well in the new situation , and enhance their consciousness of persistently " grasping things with both hands , and firmly with both hands . "  
Powell was the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff . And his thinking for directing military operations is characteristically built on clear principles of national interests , superior military forces , and minimum casualties and the explicit principle of withdrawal .  
Some analyses say that the PRC fighter intentionally struck the American craft , thinking to force the US plane to land on Chinese soil .  Some people also say that the American plane made a sudden turn toward the Jian-8 as though it were a bicycle moving forward of its own volition .

Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
However , we have just begun our study and a considerable number of comrades , particularly Party members of grassroots units , have not yet profoundly studied , comprehensively understood and profoundly comprehended the important thinking of the " three represents " , with various fuzzy understandings , which should be resolved through study .  
We should , in accordance with the characteristics of this educational campaign , satisfactorily conduct programs to study , supervise and discuss crucial and specific issues and topics , understand Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " in association with the Marxist theory on Party-building , consider this thinking in accordance with the positive and negative experiences of the CPC and parties of foreign countries , and study this thinking in association with replying and solving the significant theoretical and practical issues we are facing at present .

Pay attention to intensifying the effort to analyze Western currents of political and cultural thinking , so as to reveal their reactionary nature , to make clear their decadent and harmful character , to enhance the sense of concern and the capacity to resist corruption and change , and to control armed forces ideologically and politically .  
While progressive thinking and advanced ideas are being formed and developed , various decadent ideas and cultural elements have also been taking this opportunity to achieve infiltration , with idealism , pseudo-science , and anti-Marxist currents of political thinking raising their heads and once-eradicated ugly social phenomena appearing to be resurrected ; the corrosive effects and influence on officials ' and soldiers ' minds should not be underestimated .  
It is necessary to rectify guiding thinking on education , to set education objectives , to arrange education contents , and to improve the education system on the basis of closely centering on the implementation of the military strategic policy for the new period , so as to form an education mechanism suited for prevailing in contemporary warfare and to ensure that the military is capable of accomplishing the sacred mission of resisting aggression and maintaining the country 's unity and territorial integrity .

Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
Mao Zedong 's thinking on the untied front , Deng Xiaoping 's theory on the united front in the new period , and the theses of the party 's third-generation leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core on the united front provide the powerful ideological weapons for guiding the triumphant advanced of the united front .

He exhorted the responsible comrades concerned to do a good job in building and managing the hall , turn it into an important window for imparting scientific thinking , spirit , knowledge , and methods , and make it play a positive role in enhancing the masses ' ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities .  
There are differences between countries in their social systems , ideological thinking , perceptions of values , and religious beliefs ; therefore , in international relations , we should strictly observe the basic principles of mutually respecting each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  
Localities and departments must get a clear understanding of the situation , achieve unity in thinking , enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility , buttress confidence , bring every positive factor into play , overcome difficulties , try in every possible way to realize this year 's targets for export growth in foreign trade , and make positive contributions to the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .

Fourth , carry forward the spirit of science and democracy , enliven academic thinking .  Continue to carry out the " double-hundred policy , " encourage creative thinking , create a benign academic environment , discover and foster a large batch of outstanding young scientists , build a strong contingent of scientists and technologists with sufficient quantity and high quality , encourage them to scale up the peaks of science and technology and to occupy a position for our country in the high-tech realm of the world .  
At a deeper level , due to the influence and restraints of the " Leftist " thinking over a long time , many people still could not correctly distinguished Mao Zedong 's great historical merits and his mistakes in the late years , and could not shake off the influence of the guiding theory for the " Cultural Revolution , " namely , the " theory on continuing revolution under the proletarian dictatorship . "  
To achieve their evil purpose of splitting the motherland , Taiwan splittist forces headed by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] politically carried out , in a flagrant way , splittist activities to create " two China 's " or " one China , one Taiwan " and culturally attempted to cut off the historical and cultural ties between Taiwan and the mainland of the motherland to confuse the Taiwan society 's thinking .  
In order to score even greater victories , we must uphold the basic line of the Party , further unify the thinking of the comrades of the whole Party on the major policy decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , consciously maintain a high degree of ideological and political consistency with the Party Central Committee , and coagulate the strength of the people of all nationalities of the whole country around the magnificent objective of realizing the socialist modernization construction .  
We should understand the political value of the important thinking of the " three represents , " not only in light of the international environment faced by our country but also in light of the domestic tasks to be completed , particularly social issues .  
Proposing the important thinking of the " three represents " was aimed at effectively , completely and accurately practicing Deng Xiaoping Theory so that all issues in every sector and every corner of the society we live in are healthy and advanced , so that all negative , corrupt and evil issues will be minimized , and so that the overwhelming majority of the masses can genuinely feel that , throughout the vast territory of China , the Communist Party is good indeed !  
The important thinking of the " three represents " is beneficial for China in the 21st century , in strengthening the ideological education of cadres , consistently moving the advanced nature of Party members forward , and in enabling reform , opening up and modernization construction , particularly in operating a market economic mechanism so that we can develop healthily along the socialist road .

All military forces closely united this educational campaign with the practical struggle and the reality of the thinking of officers and soldiers and distinguishing the right and wrong regarding crucial and major issues .  
A division of Jinan Military Area Command regarded strengthening the leadership over ideological and political work as an important responsibility of party committees .  In light of the rapid development in the international and domestic situations as well as with frequent occurrence of crucial issues , this division promptly analyzed the ideological trend of the military , and adhered to the system according to which leading cadres give reports on the situation , answer questions that officers and soldiers are generally concerned about and use decisions made by the party Central Committee to unite thinking .  
At present , the important " three represents " thinking has become a major topic in the theoretical study of the entire party and a focal point of the " three stresses " education conducted among leading cadres at all levels .

If we dogmatically cling to some individual theses and specific programs of action formulated for a special situation by authors of Marxist classics in the specific historical conditions despite the changes in historical conditions and present realities , then we will have difficulty in forging ahead smoothly and we may even make mistakes because our thinking is divorced from reality .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .

Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech comprehensively , systematically , and incisively revealed the scientific implications of the " three represents " thinking .  On the basis of comprehensively summarizing the historical experience in party building over the last 80 years , he profoundly analyzed the social , economic , and political changes which have taken place since the introduction of the reform and opening-up program .  He also briefly defined the party 's nature , aim , and missions anew , showing us clearly the way forward .  
Proceeding from the intense changes in the domestic and international situation facing the party , and from the major historic task shouldered by the party , he comprehensively and profoundly expounded the scientific meaning and spiritual essence of the important thinking of the " three represents . "  
Behind the moves of Japanese political figures ' homage visits to Yasukuni Shrine are the deeply entrenched rightwing mentality in post-war Japan , radical and narrow-minded nationalist feelings , and the sustained economic depression , which has accelerated the right deviationist thinking in the Japanese society .  
We should play a vanguard role in the building of a spiritual civilization , guide the masses of all ethnic groups to emancipate their minds and renew their concepts , advocate science , and provide a strong spiritual motive power for economic growth in border areas .  We should play the role of a commando in the country 's large-scale development of its western region , firmly establish the thinking that we must develop and bring wealth to border areas while defending and consolidating them ;  
The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .  The theoretical research work of the academy must deal with every issue and every link through in-depth study and understanding .  
The important thinking of ' three represents ' has creatively enriched and developed Marxism , reflected in a concentrated way the whole view and new historical achievements of our party in upholding and developing Marxism over the last 80 years , and fully shown that the Communist Party of China has proved itself to be a Marxist political party which is firm and sober in theory , highly mature in politics , and composed and self-confident in practice . "  
It is of typical significance , unique value , and rich historical connotation in correctly approaching the historical missions of Marxism to scientifically analyze our party 's strenuous explorations over the last 80 years and the profound scientific connotations of the important thinking of " three represents . "  
Guidance should be given to retired cadres as to broadening their horizons , updating their concepts , acquiring a profound understanding of the major theoretical and practical significance of the " speech , " maintaining political staunchness , frequently renewing their thinking , keeping up with the times , and always preserving the nature of CPC members .  
At the present stage , the advanced nature of communist party members should naturally find expression in their conscientious study of Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents , " and find expression in their conscious efforts to plunge themselves into socialist economic , political , and cultural buildings with Chinese characteristics .  
State Councilor Wu Yi indicated in a written speech : In facing the present new situation wherein China is about to join the WTO , we must take both Deng Xiaoping Theory and General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " as the guide , adopt a more active approach in our participation in cooperation and competition on a global scale , and make continued efforts to push forward the practice of opening up in all directions , at multiple levels , and in a wide range of fields .  
A tremendous change , which is hardly detected by people , has occurred in the trend of China 's political thinking .  The change has occurred since China launched the drive of reform and opening up about 20 years ago .  The trend shows that a rational democratic concept and attitude has begun to be the main stream of social life , enabling China to have a very important and stable foundation for further political reform .  
Democracy must serve to resolve contemporary urgent social , political , or economic problems .  A parallel thinking is this : Whenever a political , economic , or social problem can not be resolved , people naturally pin their hopes on democracy .  
Likewise , in this vicious circle , people have accustomed to this situation : Instead of doing rational and sober thinking about democratic progress and doing things in a thoroughgoing manner , people have accustomed to raucous campaigns and movements .  They have accustomed to this idea : The first thing to do is to destroy all the things that are old .  
Due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure China 's political and social problems .  As a result , the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created .  In fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .  
He emphasized the necessity of giving prominence to key points , linking with the reality of the armed forces , closely centering around the two historical themes of " being able to win " and " not changing color " facing the PLA , thinking deeply about how to keep abreast of the new trends in the world 's military development and how to bring about development in big strides in the modernization of the armed forces , and putting forward suggestions and proposals that show real knowledge and deep insight .  
Faced with the challenge of a new century , the fiscal budget announced yesterday farsightedly called for " taking advantage of global economic integration " and " firmly grasping excellent opportunities in the hinterland to open the door to prosperity " and this has reflected new thinking and a new style in a period of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong .  
By recruiting qualified personnel from the public and reinforcing its professional contingent , the government is bound to drastically alter its way of thinking , way of doing things , and service quality and this will give a forceful impetus to Hong Kong 's robust economic recovery and help turn Hong Kong into an international commercial metropolis .  
As the Chinese military begins to pay close attention to its modernization and strives to catch up to and surpass others in every military aspect , there is a book circulating in China entitled " Chao Xian Zhan " ( " Unrestricted Warfare " ) .  It advances a tactic known as " unrestricted warfare , " and although this is neither a mature thought nor a formal line of thinking in the Chinese military , it nevertheless has evoked broad repercussions .

If the leader of the Taiwan authorities engages in wishful thinking that he can use a vague , dilatory , and evasive style to relegate the problem to the future , and throw the problem to foreign powers and the international community , the result will be something that he can not bear to imagine .  
The separatist forces have disregarded the historical trend of China 's reunification , and pleaded with foreign forces in a vain attempt to bring about " Taiwan independence . "  This is completely a futile effort out of their wishful thinking .  
She held that " the greatest obstacle to Taiwan 's future is not just the KMT 's thinking on great reunification but , still more , the CPC 's wishful thinking to define in nationalist terms Taiwan as its province and its ambition to achieve reunification of great China , " " the CPC knows too little about Taiwan , and reunification is wishful thinking , " " the CPC is the Taiwan people 's main ultimate opponent , " and " Taiwan must absolutely not take the CPC lightly . "  
He emphasized that comrades working for the NPC must conscientiously and assiduously study Marxist theory and acquire various kinds of specialized knowledge in order to improve their ideological and theoretical quality and do their job with flying colors .  In particular , they must use Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " to guide the NPC 's work , ensuring that these are fully embodied in legislation , supervision and the decision of important matters .  
Young people are in their prime , their thinking is quick , they readily accept new things , and they have an abundance of creative spirit , but the spirit of science must be firmly established , they must work hard to dig into scientific knowledge , and they must have the far-sighted aspiration of contributing their own youth and knowledge to the motherland and the people .  
Li Lanqing said at the end : To popularize scientific knowledge across the whole society , to establish scientific thinking , to promote scientific spirit , and to publicize scientific methods suit the need for implementing the strategy of developing China through science and education , for upgrading the masses ' qualities , and for facilitating a healthy development in our socialist material and spiritual civilization construction .  The tasks also suit the need for eliminating the poison inflicted by ignorance , superstition , various pseudosciences , and antisciences ; for safeguarding social stability ;  
However , the industrial and commercial circle of Taiwan could not therefore set their minds at rest .  In their thinking , it is absolutely not a simple thing that Ch'en Shih-meng , an official for the " quasi-cabinet " and a long-term advisor to Chen Shui-bian [ Chen Shuibian ] in financial and economic issues , posed the idea of collecting " national security tax " twice in one month , the period from May to early June . The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
The circular demands that through implementing the legislation law , the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments should further standardize government legislative activities , improve the quality of government legislative work , and thus spur government legislative work to express still more comprehensively and accurately General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents , " so that government legislative work , execution of laws , and supervision of execution of laws can rise to a new level .  
Wen Jiabao called for the governments at all levels and pertinent departments in the disaster areas to firmly bear in mind the party 's fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly , deepen their understanding of the anti-drought work from the high plane of stressing political awareness , be eager to meet the needs of the masses , think about what the masses are thinking about , and do a good job of providing relief to the disaster areas with warmth and enthusiasm in a solid manner .  
The PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] General Political Department the other day issued a circular demanding that the party committees and political organs at all levels further unify ideological understanding ; strengthen organization and leadership ; earnestly guide in an all-round way the positive education on " three stresses " with Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " ; and see to it that the education will yield tangible results .  
The circular demanded : We should deepen theory study by taking the important thinking of " three represents " as a core content and should further deepen understanding of the basic theoretical view of " three stresses , " and invigorate and grasp study in a down-to-earth manner in light of the characteristics at the grass-roots level and in various forms . 
It is not the product of wishful thinking that China and the United States should work for establishing a " constructive strategic partnership . "  It is based on their common needs .  It helps the governments of the two countries to grasp the major orientation in developing bilateral relations .  
The Chinese people have generally practiced pacifism and have the thinking and natural instincts of assuming the defensive .  These are integrated with their strong traditional ideology of blood relationship and their special social crowd structure .  One of the results of this humane culture is that hegemonism which is aimed at invading other countries will be difficult to develop .  
The exposition of " three represents " has pointed out a correct orientation for our realization of the party 's general objective of construction under the new situation , and is therefore a great guideline for our efforts to comprehensively strengthen the party building ; moreover , it will surely guide our way of thinking , and will encourage us to exert ourselves to make the country prosperous and strong , to forge ahead in an innovative spirit , and to build our party into a stronger and more powerful party full of youthful spirit .  
In accordance with the requirements of Chairman Jiang 's " Two Armings " , the entire military , on the basis of conducting ideological theoretical arming , has put great efforts into strengthening modern science and technology arming , especially arming with high technology knowledge , actively transforming concepts , adjusting work thinking , and putting the focus on cultivating personnel , creating talent , and comprehensively raising the quality of officers and soldiers .  
Facing new situations and tasks , ideological and political development has shouldered heavy responsibilities .  The troops in the entire army will take Chairman Jiang 's important thinking regarding the " three represents " as the guide , constantly reforming , being brave in innovating , and industriously opening up a new page in military ideological and political work .  
Meeting participants , using Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking " Three Represents " as guidance and targeting current prominent issues in public order , studied and put forward suggestions to improve comprehensive management of the social order .  
Conscientious adherence to the requirements set forth in the " Three Represents , " earnestly doing well in various aspects of work in comprehensive management of public order , maintaining social stability , creating an excellent environment for reform and development are where the fundamental interests of the broad mass of the people lie , which is also the concentrated realization of the comprehensive management of public order 's implementation of the important thinking of the " Three Represents . "  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
7 .  The cultural , trade and economic , public security , information industry , foreign trade and economic affairs departments , customs houses , and administrations for industry and commerce at various levels must unify their thinking , increase their awareness , and further define their own functions and responsibilities .  Under the leadership of the local party committee and government , they must assume their responsibilities , closely coordinate with each other , and earnestly carry out their own administrative work and strengthen their routine supervision and management .  
The speech was one of great foresight , profound thinking , incisive exposition , and rich content , containing many new thoughts and new viewpoints .  It constitutes an important Marxist document of strategic , overall , and farsighted nature , and it has the important significance of providing guidance on strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work , on comprehensively strengthening party building , and on advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
We must strengthen our investigations and studies of the trend of social thinking as well as the characteristics and the rules of changes in thinking among young officers and soldiers .  We must strengthen our studies on major theoretical and practical issues that will have impacts on the thinking activities among officers and soldiers .  We should have an initiative in carrying out the ideological and political work .  
She hoped all cadres and people of Guizhou will further seek unity of thinking on reform and opening up , change concepts , increase understanding , maintain a good spirit , seize the historical opportunity for developing the western region , make progress on one 's own initiative , make unremitting efforts to improve oneself , and work hard in a down-to-earth manner .  
Wu Shih-wen pointed out : President Chen [ Ch'en Shui-pien ] ' s idea of " fighting a decisive offshore battle " is also an army building rationale the Nationalist forces have all along upheld , which differs in no way in spirit from such a strategic thinking as " effective deterrent , tenacious defense . "  
The thinking of a " decisive battle offshore " and any overconfident military and political provocations are no doubt nonsensical and crazy practices and a risk that invites self-destruction .  Some people in Taiwan should rein in on the brink of the precipice .  
It was learned that the age limit for various leading posts set by the party Central Committee this time is mainly to make cadres younger and more intelligent and raise the quality of the ranks of cadres .  In the mean time , it is designed to enable new cadres to receive promotion earlier and encourage leading cadres of various units to adopt new thinking in their administration .  
In recent years , the Taiwan authorities led by Lee Teng-hui carried out armaments expansions without restraint , stressing augmenting the Taiwan armed forces ' control of the air and command of the sea by relying on the geographical position of an isolated island and under the guidance of the military thinking of " active defensive and effective deterrence . "  The Air Force 's special budget for the purchase of F-16 and " Mirage-2000 " fighters alone was as high as $ 12 billion .  
Chi Haotian emphasized that we should unswervingly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army , vigorously strengthen the ideological and political building of troops , earnestly study Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , earnestly study a series of expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin , resolutely implement President Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents , " continue conducting the " three stresses " education in a profound way , enhance the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , and keep the political color of our army forever .  
However , an analysis of Taiwan 's military combat capability , especially of its naval and air forces , will readily show that the Taiwan military 's so-called " decisive battle offshore " can only be described as a dangerous and dubious wishful thinking .  
Labor models and advanced workers are the outstanding representatives of China 's working class and millions upon millions of the laboring masses .  They are the vanguards of the building of material and spiritual civilization .  Their advanced thinking and exemplary deeds fully manifest the lofty style and spirit of China 's working class .  
The Central Organization Department and the Central Propaganda Department jointly held in Beijing today a report meeting on the educational activities of " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich . "  The meeting reviewed and exchanged the experience gained in conducting the " double thinking " educational activities in the previous stage , analyzed and studied their developments , and made specific plans and arrangements for the next stage of " double thinking " educational work .  
Judging from these reports , the " double thinking " educational activities in the previous stage went on smoothly and achieved initial successes because the leaders attached importance to them and because they were integrated with the reality and were conducted in numerous forms .  
During a 16 June military review , the new leader in Taiwan put forward for the first time the strategic thinking of " fighting decisive battle outside Taiwan . " He also instructed the military to enhance its information warfare capability , develop air-to-ground missiles and other offensive weaponry , set up a special agency for the development of " space weapon system , " deploy for the first time guided missile boats to the Kinmen front , and conduct live-warhead missile launching exercise .  
Over the last several months , various localities , organized by the Central Organization Department and the Central Propaganda Department in an unified way , have thoroughly implemented the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , carried out the " double thinking " educational activities in a concentrated way , and achieved a preliminary success .  
The localities generally say that to carry out educational activities on " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich " meets the objective need of China 's economic and social development , these activities are a profound ideological emancipation and mobilization at the turn of the centuries , and they are the important contents and effective carrier of the efforts to strengthen and improve the ideological and political work under new circumstances .  
Facts show that so long as people 's thinking and understanding are enhanced , the " double thinking " education will be warmly supported by the broad cadres and masses and be generally carried out in the vast urban and rural areas .  
Through the " double thinking " education , we should guide people to think out a way to enhance our confidence , vigor , cohesion and fighting power , set a correct direction , objective and working concept for our region , department and organization , and promote coordinated economic , social and cultural development by a higher standard .  
So long as we seize the opportune time to implement the spirit of the central ideological and political work conference , seriously sum up our successful experience of the preceding stage , and earnestly overcome the weak links in our work , we will certainly be able raise the " double thinking " educational activities to a higher level .  
It has thus aroused the cadets ' sense of mission and responsibility .  In addition , it has encouraged the cadets to become new-type military personnel capable of operating high-tech equipment by promoting the thinking of " letting well-trained people wait to be equipped rather than having equipment ready but without well-trained people to operate it . "  
He expressed the hope that scientific and research personnel in general would further emancipate their thinking , intensifying reforms , enhancing their science and technology innovations in prospective , basic , and strategic areas , intensifying their efforts to do a good job of attracting , training , and employing outstanding talent , concentrating their efforts on the promotion of independent innovation , and doing an even better job in the intellectual innovation pilot project .  
He said : In his half-century revolutionary career , Comrade Su Yu performed immortal feats for the liberation of the Chinese people , and made important contributions to building a modern and regularized revolutionary army ; strengthening the national defense of the New China ; and enriching and developing Mao Zedong military thinking , leaving behind him an everlasting monument and a precious legacy .  
In their speeches , they stressed the need to unify thinking with central strategic policy decisions and to be more aware of politics , the overall situation , and responsibility .  In line with the unified arrangement of the party Central Committee and the State Council , we should conscientiously make plans , work in a down-to-earth manner , avoid practicing formalism , and realistically do a good job of guiding , protecting , and bringing into play the enthusiasm and creativeness of the broad masses of the cadres and the people .  
In order to deepen the study and carry out in a comprehensive way Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's theory on democratic legal system and General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of the " three represents , " the NPC Standing Committee held a study class for chairmen of the people 's congress standing committees at provincial level in Beijing from 25 to 28 September .  
Jia Qinglin stressed : Now , the IOC 's final voting for the Olympic hosting city is less than 10 months away .  The time is pressing while our task is heavy .  Leading cadres at all levels in Beijing Municipality should achieve unity in thinking and understanding on the basis of the spirit of the central leading comrades ' instructions .  
Remarkable changes have been noticed in the ideological thinking , discipline , and work style of the country 's police contingent ; the unifying force and the competitive effectiveness of the contingent have both been enhanced on a constant basis ; and the vast numbers of public security personnel and police officers have stood the test of severe and complicated struggles , and have made outstanding contribution to safeguarding the state security , to ensuring a sound social and political stability , and to maintaining a stable public order .  
It has focussed on the major theories and practical issues related to the preparations for military struggle , thus further defining the orientation and thinking of deepening the training of troops through science and technology .  The training of troops through science and technology represents a profound revolution in the military affairs of China 's armed forces at the end of the 20th century .  
The whole army should use as its guidance Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " as well as on strengthening the armed forces and improving their training through science and technology .  In light of the military strategic principle in the new period as well as the goal of realizing the preparations for military struggle , the whole army should continuously deepen its ideological understanding .  In addition , the whole army should ensure that it follows correct orientation during the whole process of training of troops through science and technology .  
We should fully unfold education on fighting corruption and building a clean government , wage the struggle against corruption in great depth , establish a sound supervisory and administrative system , and use correct thinking , system and mechanism to curb corrupt practices in the light of the new situation , the new characteristics and the new rules of the anti-corruption struggle under the socialist market economy .  
Leaders at all levels must unify their thinking and bring it in line with the spirit of the Central Committee , truly grasp the promotion of the reforms of the basic medical insurance system for urban workers and the medical and health system as a task of fundamental importance with a close bearing on the overall situation , see to it that people 's understanding , leadership and measures are in place and that work is carried out where it really matters .  
Therefore , conscientious study , thorough understanding , and overall implementation of the thinking and requirements of the " three represents " will be of tremendous practical and far-reaching guiding significance to comprehensively carrying forward the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , comprehensively promoting the new , great project of the party building , and comprehensively fulfilling the three major tasks in the new century .  
Xiang Huaicheng demanded : With the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , comrades engaged in fiscal work must conscientiously change their mentality by changing their thinking from that of the planned finance in the past to that of public finance . 
At present , women 's federations should particularly do a good job in conducting education in current situation and policies , education in socialist ethics , and education in Marxist materialism , atheism and scientific approach in light of the progress of reform and development and the actual thinking of women ; and guide the broad masses of women to further firm their belief in Marxism , their faith in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , their confidence in reform , opening up and modernization , and their trust in the party and the government .  
What is particularly important is that the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee concentrated the wisdom of the entire party and approved the " Proposals of the CPC Central Committee on Drawing up the 10th Five-year Plan of Economic and Social Development , " which proposed the guiding thinking , goals of endeavor , and major measures for economic and social development in the next five to 10 years , united the will of the whole party , and specified the orientation for advance .  
Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's strategic thinking characterized by its broad and long-term view , the Party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , established Shanghai 's strategic position and asked the municipality to be turned into an international economic , financial , and trade center as soon as possible .  
Shanghai 's decision-makers began to open the gate to liberalize their thinking and lost no time in coming up with a new industrial strategy to " give priority to developing the tertiary industry , readjust and transform the secondary industry , and steadily upgrade the primary industry . "  It boldly changed the several-decade-old " 2-3-1 " industrial development order to the " 3-2-1 " order .  
To implement the structural readjustment guiding policies of " give-and-take " and " do something versus do nothing , " Shanghai liberated its thinking , broadened its field of vision , and used reform to set up two highly maneuverable " mechanisms " : One is the motive mechanism that lets the inferior trades and money-losing enterprises get out of the market .  
Even though the specific behaviors of and causes of the problems of some leading bodies and leading cadres in the aspect of party spirit and party styles are not completely identical , they are all directly related to their insufficient theoretical study .  To resolve these problems , it is imperative to arm their mind with theory and base themselves upon study and improvement .  Though discussions , they have unified their thinking and understanding and taken an active part in the theoretical study .  
When carrying out education on the " three stresses , " the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee has remained in close contact with the reality of state-run enterprise reform , has enhanced its understanding , has united its thinking , and has adopted vigorous measures in the areas of adjusting structures , reforming organizations and systems , and focusing on the restructuring of large enterprises while giving free hand to small ones .  It has provided a powerful force for promoting reform of the state-run enterprises and for extricating them from their difficulties .  
After going through the " three stresses " campaign , the thinking of every locality is much more free and the spirit is much more inspired ; conspicuous problems , problems of hotspots , and problems of difficult points that all appeared in the process of reform and development have been solved ; the cohesive power and fighting strength of Party organizations have been strengthened ;  
He said , the united front work conference convened by the CPC Central Committee was a meeting in which the CPC further enhanced and deepened understanding of the important status and role of the united front , unified the thinking of the whole party , and deployed and mobilized the whole party to attach importance to united front work ; it is of great significance in the history of the united front under CPC leadership in carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the future .  
Leaders of all localities and departments must take Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " three represents " thinking as a guidance and , with their boundless love for the people and in a highly responsible spirit , go deep into the grassroots units and among the masses to carefully see by themselves what difficulties are being experienced by the people .  They should help the masses solve these difficulties and promptly discover and correct any other problems so as to maintain our social stability and ensure the development of the economy .  
Our double-support work should meet the demand of the important thinking on the " three represents , " take the development of our social productive forces and the enhancement of our troops ' combat effectiveness as our fundamental starting point and standpoint .  We should follow the important principle of treating well the relations involving our army , government and civilians from the high plane of stressing politics , so that their unity will constantly consolidate and develop and make a still greater contribution to our reform , opening up and socialist modernization .  
Schools must actively mobilize themselves , proceed on the basis of their own situations , study and formulate realistic and feasible plans for logistical socialization and reform , transform ideas , thoroughly eliminate the old way of thinking of higher education of taking on everything in society , resolutely break free from traditional logistical management models , and set up a new type of logistical safeguard system for higher education that is suited to the national situation of China .  
Experiences leading to the gratifying situation in the air force 's flight safety record are varied and can chiefly be summed up as follows .  First , all air force units always insist on applying the new period 's military strategic thinking in managing things , placing military training at the center of all work , giving priority to flight training arrangements , and well maintaining continuity in flight and in training course .  Second is persistence in subjecting units to tough and strict training .  
We must fully understand the great guiding significance of the important " three represents " thinking to promoting good party style and ethical integrity and to deepening the anti-corruption struggle .  We must work according to the " three represents " requirements , conceive , plan and do the work of combating corruption and encouraging ethical integrity by even higher standards , further raise the level of our ideological understanding and work guidance , constantly further the work of promoting good party style and ethical integrity , and score even greater success in it .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " was precisely put forward from the high ground of the future and destiny of the party and state on the basis of a sober understanding and accurate grasp of the domestic and international situation , the historical tasks shouldered by the party and the reality of party building , as well as on the basis of a thorough analysis and profound summary of the positive and negative experiences of the building of proletarian political parties , especially the building of our own party .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents " shows in a concentrated way the character , purpose and fundamental tasks of our party .  It is the basis for our party building , the foundation of our holding office , and the source of our strength .  The party organizations at all levels of the central government organs and the vast numbers of party members should thoroughly comprehend the theoretical contents and practical requirements of this important thinking , and conscientiously apply it in guiding their own thinking and action .  
China is a vast country with a population of over 1.2 billion people , and broadcasting has close ties with the thinking , work and life of the masses .  The role of broadcasting can not be overlooked or replaced in the urban and rural areas , especially in the remote agricultural and pastoral areas .  Broadcasting has a great promise and a great future .  
The meeting stressed : The central authorities ' decision that county and city departments and village cadres across the country must carry out the education program of studying the important thinking concerning the " three represents . "  This is an important policy decision for improving grassroots cadres ' competence and increasing the coherence and militancy of grassroots party organizations in the rural areas under the new situation .  It is also an important move for strengthening and improving the party 's leadership over rural affairs and promoting rural areas ' economic development and social progress .  
Wu Yi , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and state councilor , sent a letter to the conference and delivered a written speech .  She asked all customs offices in the country to take the important thinking of " three represents " as guidance , administer customs in a strict manner , deepen reform , and turn China 's customs into scientific , civilized , honest , efficient and modernized customs .  
Li Tieying pointed out in his speech , at the historic moment of the turn of the century , standing at the plane of historical materialism , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " has made a new and scientific summation of our party 's nature , purpose , and tasks , and embodied the innovative spirit of making efforts to open up new realms in Marxism geared to the 21st century .  
We must vigorously propagate and popularize scientific knowledge , scientific thinking , and scientific methods ; guide the masses of cadres in building scientific , civilized , and healthy social trends and fine lifestyles ; and constantly meet the growing cultural needs of the masses of peasants , thereby promoting the two civilizations in the rural area .  
Now , Chen Shui-bian has made the three-step proposal of " from economic and trade integration to cultural integration and further to political integration " which sublates the bipolar thinking between reunification and independence and attempts to lay a foundation of mutual-benefit for cross-strait relations and build a new framework of interaction for long-term peace .  This is a pragmatic thinking conducive to maintaining stability on the Taiwan Straits .  
The participants held that the eight proposals put forward in President Jiang Zemin 's important speech on developing cross-strait relations and pushing the motherland 's peaceful reunification represent the application and development in the new situation of Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's basic thinking on " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems , " and is a programmatic document and guiding idea for settling the Taiwan problem in the current stage .  
The party committees at all levels should fully understand the momentous and far-reaching significance of the current " study and education " activities , further integrate their thinking with the major policy decisions of the central authorities , use the idea of " three represents " to lead and assume overall responsibility for the agricultural and rural work , strengthen leadership , organize the work carefully , seek actual results , and have a good and firm grasp of the " study and education " activities conscientiously .  
The dissemination of scientific knowledge , scientific thinking , and scientific spirit will be a long-term and arduous task .  This state of affairs is out of step with the great cause of national revitalization that the Chinese nation is undertaking , so we must make concerted efforts to create a positive environment that is conducive to the healthy development of the awareness of innovation .  We should seize the great opportunity of implementing the 10th Five-Year Plan ;  
Luo Gan said : Over the past year , the procuratorial organs throughout the country conscientiously studied and worked hard to practice General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " continued to set strict demands on their work and the performance of their law enforcement duties , and obviously enhanced the level of fairness in law enforcement and improved the social image of the procuratorial personnel . 
The Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee held a forum today to study Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " running the country with virtue . "  According to their personal experiences and the characteristics of their respective work , some experts and scholars , comrades who had long been engaged in ideological and political work , and responsible officials of relevant departments in the capital talked glowingly about what they had gained from studying this important thinking .  
At a national conference of propaganda department directors held earlier this year , General Secretary Jiang Zemin clearly pointed out that in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , we must adhere to the important thinking on " governing the country according to law " and that on " running the country with virtue " simultaneously .  This has evoked tremendous repercussions among the people throughout the country .  
Those attending today 's forum unanimously held : Putting forward this important thinking is of profound theoretical and practical significance , and it is a scientific thesis reached on the basis of summing up foreign and domestic experiences in governing countries as well as an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory of states ; it is also an important overall strategy for running the country put forward at a time when our country is entering a new stage of economic and social development .  
In a written speech , Luo Guojie , professor at the Chinese People 's University , said : This thinking is an important theoretical development of socialist politics , ethics , and law , and it is bound to practically produce a positive influence on social stability and moral practice in our country and to greatly accelerate our drive for socialist modernization .  
He held : In carrying out moral construction , we must persistently guide ourselves with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the important concept of the " three represents " and firmly grasp various important links influencing the formation of people 's thinking and moral ideas ; in addition , we must make and implement concrete guiding plans and integrate the requirements of the basic moral ideas into relevant laws , regulations , and specific policies and into various social controls .  
A national forum for the members of the first batch of supervision and inspection groups concerning study and education activity of the important thinking of the " three represents " in rural areas has just concluded today .  This reporter has learned from the forum that upon the approval of central leading comrades , the first batch of six supervision and inspection groups , which are respectively headed by provincial-level veteran comrades , will soon leave for 12 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities to supervise and inspect the progress of the study and education activity there .  
Under the strong leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , take the important thinking on " three represents " as a guideline , keep firm confidence and soaring spirits , do down-to-earth work , get united to make progress , and strive to achieve our country 's grand objectives of reform , opening up , and modernization in the new century .  
Using high technologies , starting from on high to deal with China in the outer space to attract China 's attention , making it concentrate its entire financial , material and human resources , as the former Soviet Union did , on an arms race in the outer space .  Then , cutting the ground from under China 's foot , completely do China in .  Such kind of calculations based on wishful thinking , to be sure , is also very laughable .  
Based on the new situation at home and abroad , the tasks of the party , and the reality of party building , Comrade Jiang Zemin set forth his important thinking of " three represents . "  This has provided our party and state with a powerful ideological weapon for further understanding , improving , and developing themselves in the 21st century , which is imbued with challenges and hopes .  
During the past year , the NPC and its standing committee , in line with the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents , " earnestly performed the lofty responsibility entrusted to it by the Constitution and laws and made new progress in conducting legislative and supervisory work , and it carried out highly effective work and produced outstanding results in the endeavor to establish a rudimentary socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics and implement the basic plan of running the country according to law and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
Let us rally more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , meet the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents " in an all-round way , enhance our vigor and vitality , forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit , work in a down-to-earth manner , and exert ourselves in the struggle to achieve the goal of the 10th Five-year Plan and build an affluent , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
They should seriously implement the important " three represents " thinking , devote more efforts to political construction , and unswervingly arm their minds with Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the series of important theses by President Jiang so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation , consolidate the spiritual pillar , and build a strong mental defense line .  
Safeguarding the authority of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is our most cardinal political principle and discipline and represents the basic interests of the state , the nation , and the broad masses of people .  All officers and men of the PLA must have a highly unified thinking , maintain a very firm attitude , and act on their own initiative .  
Speaking on building stronger contingents of procuratorial personnel and improving their competency and law enforcing efficiency , Han Zhubin said : The National Procuratorial College , during the course of studying and implementing the important " three represents " thinking and working hard to improve the political awareness and professional competency of procuratorial personnel , trained more than 200 procuratorial officers before they were promoted to serve as chief procurators .  By the end of the year , local procuratorates also had trained one-third of their procuratorial officers on a rotational basis .  
Zhang Deguang said : Over more than 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the building of a democratic legal system has been strengthened constantly in our country , which has promoted the establishment of a socialist market economic system .  The thinking of governing the country by law has won support from the people .  
While talking about all these work results , the NPC deputies and CPPCC members also pointed out : We must pay close attention to the problem of an unbalanced growth among different areas during the course of the country 's economic development , and must help minority nationality areas broaden their way of thinking on the issue of developing their economy .  During the process of implementing the gist of the central authorities concerning the large-scale development of the country 's western region , we must lay special stress on achieving tangible results .  
Second , we must help minority nationality areas in the country 's western region change their traditional way of thinking on the issue of economic development , adopt the principle of " establishing finite targets , and making advances in some fields while retreating from others , " make a full use of the advantages of the country 's western region in having a biological diversity and a nationality diversity , and build up an industrial structure and systems that enjoy distinguishing local features .  
Promoting comprehensive economic and social development , properly building the material and spiritual civilizations , making efforts to promote the coordinated development of the urban and rural areas and of different regions , keeping economic development , population , resources , and the environment in line , and bringing about sustainable economic and social development are the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , are important expression of our party 's " three represents " thinking , and are also the direction for the process of socialist modernization which we must firmly grasp .  
We should follow the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory , earnestly study Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " conscientiously implement the spirit of the fifth plenary session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , further enhance the quality and effectiveness of the motion handling work through the joint efforts of the entire committee members , the CPPCC participant units , the CPPCC routine functional organs , and the motion recipient units , thus play a more positive role in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
should firmly and unremittingly tackle problems like impure thinking or erroneous styles among personnel concerned ; and should attach great importance to professional training for judges or procurators at the grassroots level by ensuring the greatest support for them in this regard , and by choosing and assigning the best teachers for them as well .  In order to heighten overall quality of judges or procurators , we must work hard for several years to come .  
To develop and invigorate a place , the key lies in whether or not the leading body can set an example for the rank-and-file and have a good ideological style , a correct line of thinking , and a correct direction .  The building of the ranks of public servants is of vital importance to establishing a good image for the government .  
The session called on the people of all ethnic groups in the country to rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , uphold the party 's basic line , use the important " three represents " thinking as a guidance , explore ways to advance , do solid work , and strive with one mind to implement the 10th Five-Year Plan and build China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
What is different from the previous plans is that the 10th Five-Year Plan regards raising the living standard of the broad masses as a basic point of departure .  It embodies the alignment of national planning with the people 's livelihood and is a plan that fully reflects General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents . "  
It holds fast to the crux of China 's modernization drive at the beginning of the new century and fully embodies the global views and strategic thinking of the party central committee .  Hence , it is the basic guiding principle which we must understand and take advantage of in the future economic and social development of China .  
Zeng Qinghong stressed : We must push forward in depth the study and education activity on the important thinking of " three represents " in rural areas , strive to meet the prescribed targets in real terms , and further make people 's ideological understanding on the activity conform to the requirements of the central authorities .  
The Republican-led government can not blindly imitate the China policies of the Clinton administration , nor can it go back to the doctrine of " strategic partnership . "  In the US , where politics is deeply partisan , such a shift is not without justification , but in reality the new US administration will not move in the direction of the other extreme , which would mean applying Cold War thinking to an emergent China and a wholesale repudiation of the positive results gained by the China policies of the previous administration .  
This decision is completely consistent with Bush 's line of thinking that we would do " whatever it took to defend Taiwan . " No wonder that Luo-de , former U.S . ambassador to China and assistant secretary of state for Asian-Pacific affairs during the Clinton administration believe that undoubtedly the Bush administration , which has assumed office for less than 100 days , is changing the established policy pursued by the previous administrations on the Taiwan issue .  
" As textbook is one of the resources to support teaching , its content should be impartial and factually correct to facilitate training of independent thinking and analytical skills amongst students .  " Thus , in December 1995 , basic principles and examples from a number of subjects were given to textbook publishers associations on textbook revision .  Those basic principles included ' revision should be kept to the minimum and complete revision of textbooks should be avoided ' .  
* To be a person who has deep love of our mother country and is committed to the development of the mainland as well as Hong Kong ; * To be biliterate and trilingual ; * To be a person with immense and extensive knowledge , independent thinking , creativity and enthusiasm ; and * To be a teacher who is caring and eager to serve our community and a person with lofty ideal and high moral standards , who is ready to shoulder the onus in the education of our younger generation . "  
To ride the tide of the New Economy , young people can no longer rely solely on their university diplomas for job security .  Apart from professional knowledge and communication skills , they need to possess vision , alterness , independent thinking and a proactive attitude .  Only when equipped with these qualities will they be able to see the wider picture of the changing social and economic environment and keep pace with the advancement in the new century .  
We need a workforce who have a strong sense of purpose ; who are knowledgeable and competent in the work they do ; capable of independent and critical thinking ; sensitive and responsive to change ; positive and resilient in the face of setbacks ; and creative in problem-solving .  
As for the longer-term challenges , Mr Tung said that central to our policy thinking and activities was how we could as a society best make the transition to a knowledge economy from our current starting point in the shortest time possible , ride the waves of progress of China with the greatest success and least economic and human dislocations , and adapt ourselves to the era of globalised competition and in the end come up with an economy that can perform brilliantly in the most demanding and competitive situations .  
( a ) An individual 's vulnerability to the development of emotional problems is affected by a variety of biological , psychological and socioeconomic factors , such as coexisting physical illness , a negative way of thinking in face of adversities or lack of social support .  
Speaking at the workshops is an experienced teacher in teaching children with special educational needs , Mrs Colette Wong , who has her training in specific learning difficulties at the Hornsby International Dyslexia Centre in London . At the workshops , Mrs Wong will share with participating teachers her practical experience and the teaching strategies to help students with specific learning difficulties in the areas of speech sound awareness , word recognition , reading strategies , information processing , memory skills and creative thinking .  
We need to develop a committed workforce of nurses who are capable of analytical thinking , and are ready to deliver high quality service based on updated professional knowledge and skills .  
Organised by the Curriculum Development Institute ( CDI ) of the Education Department , the Knowledge Fair covered such main themes as development of critical thinking and creativity through learning activities , assessment for learning to improve learning and teaching , and school-based curriculum development .  The four key tasks , namely project learning , reading to learn , moral and civic education , and information technology for interactive learning were also included .  
Ladies and gentlemen , I have enormous faith in our future .  That confidence is not based on wishful thinking .  It 's based on what I have just outlined - a clear understanding of our positioning , and a whole range of initiatives coming on stream over the next few years .  
" We have attached great importance to the moral and healthy development of our students .  Through a variety of learning activities , students are provided with amble opportunities to develop positive values and attitudes , healthy lifestyles and critical thinking skills to handle the problems arising from their daily encounters and social issues , " an EMB spokesman said .  
The former approach , used by athletes , falls under the psychological heading of image therapy . Requiring no physical activity to reach its goal , the method might be considered a type of positive thinking exercise . Pleasant experiences are reinforced , and negative stimuli are reduced to a bare minimum .  
Environmental thinking has entered our everyday lives . Housing advertisements , besides noting floor space and kitchen appliances as they did five or six years ago , are now apt to mention the residential environment as well - - " quiet neighborhood , " " green yard , " " swimming pool , " and so forth .  
Prosperity in economic development is foreseeable , but in addition to that , greater creativity and independence must be encouraged in education , greater receptivity to different ideas must be cultivated in thinking , and in culture , we must break free of following the obsolete trails of the West and search for a new direction in which to restore national consciousness .  
The Taiwan Photographic Society , whose motto was realism with a local color , and the Photographic Society of China , whose rallying cry was salon pictorialism , represented the two main streams of photography on Taiwan during the 1960s and 70s . Because of differences in viewpoint , language , and thinking , the two groups moved in different circles of activity and engaged in different spheres of endeavor .  
The result has been a change from unitary to pluralistic values , from closed ways of thinking to open ones , from moral and ethical considerations as a prime determinant of human relations to utilitarian and materialistic interests , from a simple and impoverished way of life to more prosperous and complex lifestyles .  
There have been evident achievements over the last thirty years enabling traditional thought to compete on good terms with the current of practical thinking , which gives hope that it will be able to become the leading current in the future .  
His words illustrate the type of thinking that lay behind the art of embroidery in ancient times . The use of celestial bodies and aspects of nature as designs for clothing reflects the harmony and fusion of man and nature . The flowery fowl is the brightly colored pheasant , the aquatic grasses express cleanliness , fire stands for illumination , and rice represents nourishment . Together the patterns are a symbol of the moral ideal of government , of concern over the destiny of mankind and compassion for the people .  
Given the influence of the thinking that ' man and the heavens each reflect the other , ' Chinese astronomical observation could never escape superstition , " explains Hwang Yi-nung , associate professor of History at Tsing Hwa University . When official astronomers witnessed an unusual celestial event , they would attach some forced political meaning to it , and rarely explored for the objective truth .  
In a less active sense , I hope that administrative personnel can be streamlined , that their level of quality can be raised , and that they can be more clean and honest . That is my thinking .  
Manufactured " through a meticulous and laborious process , sacrificial hogs still do not avoid the fate of being slaughtered , but they are used in a ceremonial rite before being divided up among the people involved and served in a big banquet shared with the gods . That is the aesthetic concept of " one-time use , " a concept that is quite prevalent in the thinking of today 's consumers ! (  
Under political party competition , society has the right to ask that the parties and the candidates they put forward have a high degree of ' political responsibility ' and meet the competitive ethics of party politics , " says Kao Hui-yu , a reporter for the United Daily News . Similarly , candidates need to promote a sense of public responsibility in order to change voters ' thinking from passive mobilization into active participation .  
Orchid Island is located about 49 nautical miles east of the city of Taitung . With education relatively late and travel inconvenient , much traditional culture and thinking is preserved .  
As part of this way of thinking , Chinese people strive to maintain a balance within the individual between the forces of yin and yang ( the dual principles of male and female , or positive and negative ) , which have influenced the concepts of hot and cold in Chinese food and medicine .  
Sharon Liu ( owner of the Colorful Farmer Co . , 35 , divorced , with two children ) I 've always been pretty traditional in my thinking . I was a typical " bride-to-be student " in junior college . I always thought that a woman 's place was in the home , and I wanted to be a good wife and parent just like my mother , so after I married I quit my job and concentrated on being a housewife .  
The problem is that our civil servants have not yet comprehended this shift , and are still stuck in the thinking and methods of the 1950 ' s . They just think about playing the leading role and telling others what they should do and ca n't do , which product to develop - - these are not official topics , so there are always conflicts with private entrepreneurs . In fact in many things the people are more capable than officials .  
Looking further ahead , " in fact , education for the gifted should n't be a monopoly of the elite , " teacher Lin Chih-chung says . " Everyone has the right to being trained in nonrigid thinking . It 's just that the system of big classes and the pressure to pass exams here have stifled most people 's potential and made gifted children such conspicuous exceptions . "  
What they shared in common was in showing new problems brought about by social development , such as conflicts between development and traditional ways of thinking or the adverse health effects of pollution and the fast pace of contemporary life brought about by industrialization . I feel the articles have a lot of reference value , because these situations are ones that the mainland is encountering or is going to encounter in the course of opening up .  
Though studying this or that ever since I was a child , I maintained a playful attitude and was always looking for something to throw myself into with all my heart , " Tsai recalls . After a teacher discovered that he had natural talent for the high jump in junior high school , he began to compete . At one time he had the junior high school record in the event , and he was crowned district champion . " And so I started thinking my life would be in track and field , " he says .  
From their talk , Tsai Jung-pin discovered that she had a good head on her shoulders . This clear thinking added to her slender body and agile movements gave her the potential of a smart athlete . She was a very polishable piece of rough jade , and Tsai was interested in putting her under his wing .  
It was not long before they came to accept this as natural - - if you wanted to get ahead then you had to actively take part in the League , national mass study organizations and social work . Moreover , there could be no questioning of communist thinking ; otherwise one would be seen as a rebel and expelled from the League , making further study impossible .  
But if cars can pass through on a new cross-island highway , people will just drive through , passing Yuli in an instant . " It 's like when the southern cross-island highway was built , " he says . " At first everyone at the eastern starting point of Haituan was vigorously in favor of opening the road , thinking that people would be able to get to Taitung in only an hour , but since then the city has been in gradual decline . "  
Under a situation that was too much even for the Cantonese character , renowned for its defiant tendency , the natives could only cause relatively minor disturbances for the British military , and the " shame of changing masters " became deeply embedded in their hearts . Yet the threads of nationalist thinking had not yet come together in the minds of the people .  
Last year , Diamonds in the Rough helped 10,000 graduates of junior high schools all over the province , each through individual guidance . The guidance counselor - - usually the child 's ninth grade counselor - - regularly telephones them each week and visits their homes or the places they study or work , listening to their heartfelt concerns , correcting their thinking and giving them information on finding jobs or continuing their schooling . How long does counseling have to go on before a case is considered closed ?  
I 'd get tired of thinking about it , and I was always frustrated . " Being interviewed at home , Lu is talking a bit fast and in a somewhat disorganized manner , but she is not at all the inarticulate dumb broad she is on the tube .  
But unless some major revisions are made to this promising star of tomorrow - - so you can fold it like an umbrella and store it away when not in use - - the electric car will provide no solution for traffic jams and parking hassles . Going to work electronically : Therefore , some people are casting aside the model of thinking wherein motion necessarily involves people , vehicles and roads to look for a substitute for vehicles .  
Associate professor Chung Wei-wen of National Chengchi University 's Graduate School of Journalism agrees with this judgement . Yet he still wants to wake up potential overseas students to the fact that knowledge is not a passive thing . When you go abroad , you can see the environment in all its pluralism and complexity , but if you do not have the ability to make acute observations and just hold on to your fixed frame of thinking , then it is like returning empty handed from a mountain of treasures .  
Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate . " But , that would probably be very hard , and I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to get a positive response from the farmers . "  
Different in thinking but not in status : Wildlife protection groups around the world today generally come in two kinds : One takes radical action to support the total prohibition of trade in endangered species ; the other believes that wildlife protection can not be accomplished in a single step and tries to study and gain an understanding of local conditions and works with local agencies or scholars in order to carry out long-term , systematic protection .  
Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide . He argues that in the two hundred years since the industrial revolution , the large-scale use of non-recyclable materials by mankind has allowed modern people to enjoy the same standard of living as an ancient emperor attended by 200 servants .  
A bird in the bush worth two in the hand : Hsu Cheng , director of the registration department at the National Palace Museum , says that flower and bird painting started growing from thinking about nature in the Tang dynasty , and after a rapid blossoming in the period of the Five Dynasties took to the path of realism , seeking to imitate nature in its mode of representation . With such realism requiring high artistic skills , perfect technique became the objective sought after by artists .  
Taoist doctrine was originally developed from the thinking of the Taoist masters . These masters actually preached passive inaction and following nature , but Taoist doctrine turned this basic naturalism into a different kind of reasoning which affirmed that various " natural " methods , such as alchemy and controlled breathing , could actually resist the limitations of nature and extend life without limitation .  
Fan Kang-lung , a young sculptor who has become well-known for carving eagles , says that humans always see eagles alone , never in groups . " Eagles are so often just a black speck high up in the sky , you can never get very close to them . They 're alone , distant and hazy , unwilling to be caught up in the troubles of everyday life , thinking that others can not understand their passionate , burning life . ' '  
At the end of the Ching dynasty , with the failure of the 100 Days Reform , the reformist royalist protectors Kang Yu-wei and Liang Chi-chao , both Cantonese , fled abroad . They published newspapers and established schools for the overseas Chinese in all kinds of places , stirring up patriotic thinking . It was only then that the Overseas Chinese began to identify with their country and became enthusiastic about politics .  
By the same token , those people who hope that the government can start political discussions on this subject with the Chinese Communists as soon as possible are apt to be accused of demeaning themselves and strengthening the enemy 's hand , while those who propose ignoring the Chinese Communists and appealing directly for international support are accused of wishful thinking and blindness to reality , or of opportunistically seeking Taiwanese independence . . . .  
Such is the case with Chinpao Shan 's Tsao Ji-chang , who makes his complex very clear . " Most mainlanders have a wily nature : great at talking , loving to argue but not liking hard work ; they are very suitable for thinking up ideas and moving their mouths , but their sincerity is limited . They often put profit before right , and let the boss lose out . "  
Recently , Hollywood 's studios made some adjustments to Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid When these fairy tales were produced for the big screen so that the films would better conform with current feminist thinking . In Beauty and the Beast , departing her former meek and submissive image , the character Beauty was depicted as an intelligent , independent , and headstrong woman who liked to read .  
One example can be found in the Taiwan television serial " Empress of an Age , " where aside from portraying the Empress Wu as a strong female in the traditional mold , the writers also see fit to credit her success to the support of two capable men . Not even a TV series which exalts the most legendary female figure in Chinese history can escape the confines of maleoriented thinking .  
Furthermore , in the spirit of " If I do n't enter hell , who will ? " he has courageously infiltrated the heart of the system . Perhaps on the surface it appears that he can gain status and honored treatment . But , on the outside , he must fend off vicious attacks from right and left , and , on the inside , must constantly be thinking about how to maintain his judgement and not become confused . This is certainly no easy process !  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
When they play matchmaker for unsuspecting foreign firms , they often introduce them to inefficient enterprises . In the end not only were mainland industries not saved from their doldrums , even the foreign businesses involved in cooperative investment were dragged down into the vortex , suffering greatly . Time to sink or swim " Now the way of thinking has changed , " Zhang Zhiqun explains .  
Just as Sun Ta-chuan , secretary-general of the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples ' Cultural Association has said , many Han Chinese have begun to realize that the everyday wisdom inherent in aboriginal culture includes important human factors which have long been lost from their own lives . Such " two-way " thinking is gradually growing into a sound and mutually adaptive interethni relationship .  
Those amazing Chinese parents " All things are beneath contempt , only education is to be esteemed . " " Only if you suffer can you surpass others . " The ancient sages have left many a pithy phrase to inspire us to greater heights . They articulate the line of thinking in Chinese culture which argues that learning is the only path to respectable success .  
Moreover , her articles were rigorously structured , with clearly presented lines of thinking for readers to follow . A second special feature is that she did not avoid expressing her positions on important issues facing the country and society . Her works were filled with support for " nativism " and " Taiwan first . " This set her apart from the introspective faction of writers who shied away from touching upon larger debates of collective interest .  
One scientific theory is that in this state the right hemisphere of the brain , which controls imagination , memory , creativity , and sensibility , is active , whereas the left hemisphere of the brain , which controls analytical thought , value judgments , and logical thinking , is suppressed . Someone who is hypnotized enters a trance-like state controlled by the right hemisphere .  
For example , to get his patients to release their emotions , he uses the Buddhist tantric " methods for seeing and thinking " as well as methods making use of modern physics that involve light , heat and magnetism . He teaches patients to use deep meditation to focus their energy on the part of the body that is uncomfortable in daily life . He also uses yoga to dispel accumulated depressed energy through relaxing the body .  
It 's no longer startling to see stories in the press of students and parents thinking that the behavior of such teachers is wrong , some teachers have even been physically attacked . Now we 're hearing calls to " maintain respect for teachers " even from university campuses , where the nation 's highest - ranking intellectuals are trained . This means that the traditional respect for teachers is being widely challenged all across contemporary society .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
Speaking of his 40-year quest to recreate the wooden ox , Wang Jian comments : " I have loved mechanical toys ever since I was a child . When I learned the story of the wooden ox I began making one out of cardboard and wood . I began drawing designs at middle school , and continued thinking on the subject at university , where I read mechanical engineering . My main sources were " Making the Wooden Ox " from Zhuge Liang 's Collected Works , and the documentary records of Zu Chongzhi . "  
The idea of " mindset " should not be limited to " positive thinking , " as emphasized by Haruyama . It also should include imagination , which can far transcend the practical realities of society . Thought patterns characterized by imagination are unrestrained by ordinary standards , and do not bow down to " reality . " This is a way of thinking that emphasizes the future and creativity .  
Haruyama 's philosophy in fact is simply a more rational form of a very popular current wave of thinking in Taiwan-the individualism of Taiwan 's so-called " new youth , " who refuse to get involved in the public sphere and who extol the idea that " as long as it makes me happy , there 's nothing wrong with it .

It is necessary to make use of the existing funding channels , adjust the orientation of the input of funds and the thinking of building bases , strengthen dynamics in supporting agricultural construction projects in the western region , and focus attention on grasping the building of commodity grain , cotton and sugar-bearing crop production bases as well as dry-land crop and water-saving farming demonstration counties and pastoral area comprehensive development demonstration projects in the western region .  
In the past half a century and more , Comrade Chen Yun 's philosophical thinking has helped resolved many major party and state affairs .  This has not only won my respect and admiration , but it has also made me realize deeply that at that time I was able to understand only its " application " aspect and did not approach it from the level of world outlook and methodology .  My understanding of it was very superficial .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have all along adhered to the principle that " development is the last word , " always kept in mind Deng Xiaoping 's thinking that " poverty is not socialism , development at an overly slow speed is not socialism either ; the superiority of socialism should ultimately be embodied in the better development of productive forces " and , closely centering on the economic construction , achieved the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
The success of the exercise fully reflected the great achievements of the air force logistics system in seriously implementing Chairman Jiang Zemin 's strategic thinking on strengthening the army through science and technology , persisting in taking as their goal winning a high-tech local war , and actively launching mass science and technology training , closely centering on the focal and difficult points in logistics in actual combat .  
After watching the exercise , Chi Haotian said : The Air Force is a hi-tech service which fights decisive battles in the air but relies on ground support .  Without strong logistics support , the Air Force would be deprived of strong combat effectiveness .  Chi stressed and pointed out : Conducting scientific and technological training is a major measure for implementing Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong force through science and technology ;  
If the US Government could be introspective regarding their failure , it would not be difficult to discover that the politicizing of human rights is wishful thinking , and has already caused a lot of countries in the world , especially developing countries , to be strongly disapproving .  And it is also an obstacle to all kinds of economic development by the United Nations . This affects dialogue and cooperation about human rights between all member countries .  
By means of virtual reality , we can transform the future into the present as the direct subject of thinking and achieve the " seamless linkage " between the past , the present , and the future in the realm of thinking .  This brings the mode of thinking more in sync with the systematic , comprehensive , and multidimensional characteristics of military thinking .  
Today , with the reforms and opening to the outside , only when leading cadres at all levels possess noble values , strive to become pure people , noble people , people detached from base interests , people benefiting the people , thinking what the masses think , feeling the anxiety of the masses , suffering first , enjoying later , content to live an austere life , and having far-reaching ambitions , can they unite and lead the masses to approach common prosperity sooner .  
In upholding the new thinking of running schools with an open-minded spirit , we should make the following efforts : We should gear education of military academies toward society , dovetail it with the state 's higher education , learn from the reform experiences gained by local universities , extensively carry out cooperative exchanges , rely on the solid strength of local colleges and universities , and cultivate military officers through joint efforts made by military and civil sectors .  
This important thinking , with rich content , profound thought and prominent characteristics of the current era , being highly theoretical and practicable , is a new summary of the Party 's nature , of its essential principles and of its historic mission , is a new development in Marxist theory on Party construction and is a new requirement of the Party organizations and cadres at all levels in the new situation .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
The corrosive effects of decadent thinking and culture have particularly impeded the forming and establishment of a correct world outlook among officers and men , distorted some people 's outlook on life and concept of values as well as led to problems and deviation in moral quality and life pursuits among them .  
Around the two historic questions of how to " fight and win " and how one does " not become degenerate , " we now should emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , smash the trammels of outmoded ideas and the old way of thinking , earnestly study new situations and problems , and explore new ideas , new methods , and new ways to solve major practical problems in the armed forces in order to keep raising the level of army building .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
The General Staff , Political , and Logistics Departments and major military units held party committee and standing committee meetings on numerous occasions to study and grasp the important thinking .  The principal leaders of these departments and units were personally involved in the mobilization efforts and took the lead in discussing their personal experience and in attending lectures .  
Studying and understanding the important thinking of the Three Represents should be the key content in such study programs as Party committees central groups , theoretical learning programs for cadres ranked above regiment level and the education through Party 's lectures .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
The PLA General Political Department held a training course for the party secretaries of its directly subordinate units from 10 May to 15 June to conscientiously study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " .  The training course aimed to further improve the ideological level and the ability of leadership of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees , and to enhance the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the leading bodies of party committees .  
In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
The issues of belief and conviction involve many major issues including our guiding thought , social system , cadres ' contingent building , as well as people 's thinking that have a bearing on the rise and fall and success and failure of our party .  Faced with tough challenges in the new millenium , and at a time of comprehensively pushing forward our cause into the new century , we need a strong spiritual force even more .  
Leading cadres should take the lead in studying the " Three Represents " , should publicize and disseminate the " Three Represents " through their personal fruitful experiences , and should go deep down to the grassroots units , instructing them face to face , explaining the difficult points and unclear points , inspiring and guiding them , and assisting the Party members and broad numbers of officers and soldiers in grassroots units in their effectively studying and satisfactorily carrying out the important thinking of the " Three Represents " .  
Through education on " the importance of studying , being political minded and being honest and upright " and education on party style and discipline , we should help the broad masses of party members and cadres foster a correct world outlook and concept of life and value and firmly resist material gains and commercialization in their political life .  We should help them clarify their thinking and distinguish between right and wrong and constantly strengthen their ability to repel corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
We should combine that basis with the thinking of officers and men , carry out psychological adjustment education , provide guidance to officers and men to cultivate lofty ideals , for good mentality , for living well , and to help lay a solid ideological foundation for training " four haves " military personnel .  
The more distinct and stronger the main theme is , the more unified our thinking will be , the more closely our forces will be rallied , the more united our people will become , the more stable our society will be , the more smoothly our reforms will advance , and the greater guarantee we will provide for the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our economy .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
The core of Taiwan armed forces ' thinking of " decisive battle outside border " is : They will offer tenacious resistance on offshore islands , make timely landing raids on enemy shores , take advantage of the advanced performance of their main naval and air weapons to first impose war on the enemy , let war start on the enemy 's shore , and prevent war from reaching their own " doorstep " .  
We should take a strategic view of being responsible for the future of our military construction .  We should devote efforts to doing well the work of cultivating , using and improving college-graduate cadres .  We should change our thinking , make reasonable arrangements , and create the conditions so that they , in military construction , can make great achievements that are worthy of this great epoch .  
Treating young officers and solders in the new period , we must understand them with a high period feel and by breaking away from old thinking .  We should see from them their epochal spirit and positive factors , see more of their fine points and less of their shortcomings and see more about the innate character and less from the outside appearance .  Only in this way , can we truly carry out ideological and political work with a definite objective in view .  
The complexity of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that we are improving and developing the self-reform of the socialist system and the world is undergoing a profound change .  Against this background , people 's thinking has become lively ;  
The arduousness of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that international and domestic factors are complex and people 's thinking is lively , complex , varied , and constantly changeable from person to person , from matter to matter , and from time to time .  
Training for our army 's mechanized troops has entered a new phase because we have inspected our science-and-technology military training achievements in a " stage " of war that resembled modern war , and departed from previous " playacting " exercises that were based on wishful thinking .  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
They sought high-level and large projects , blindly scaled " heights " , and hankered for large projects and " modern methods " .  Some units focused their thinking on making achievements and exploring new spheres and neglected the mastery of existing equipment .  As a result , science-technology military training deviated from the track .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
We must study his noble character of being loyal to the party and the people , study his lofty spirit of seeking truth from facts and upholding the truth , and study his solid and strict style of work .  Under the leadership of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we must adhere to Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on foreign affairs , unflinchingly carry out the foreign policy of independence and peace , and further open up a new prospect for China 's diplomatic work .  
After the cold war ended , the U.S . military 's traditional opponent has gone out of existence .  Driven by its strategic need to assert sole hegemony over the globe with its " new cold-war thinking " and its narrow interest in expanding the increasingly shrinking survival space for military forces , the U.S . military has always been concocting a virtual opponent .  
Reform and opening up is a historical policy decision determining the fate of contemporary China . This great practice has not only greatly liberated and developed productive forces , but also greatly emancipated people 's minds , deeply transformed the mental outlook of the masses of people , and promoted the constant progress of social thinking .  
These changes will exert an extensive , profound and comprehensive influence on the military 's thinking , and challenge ideological and political education in fundamental and temporal ways .  
The military and citizens of the entire country have employed the important words of General Secretary Jiang Zemin to unify their thinking , with each blazing patriotic heart being transformed into a concrete action for supporting and sacrificing to national defense modernization .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
As long as we seek unity of thinking , have a firm grasp of the principal line of strategic economic structural adjustment , persist in doing a good job of economic structural adjustment in the course of development , and maintain the rapid development while making economic structural adjustment , we will certainly usher in a still more glorious and splendid future .  
They sufficiently respected , trusted and supported brigades and regiments in executing their rights for independently administering grassroots units , and allowed brigades and regiments to have leading roles in devoting efforts to grassroots units .  But some institutions above the level of division still adhere to traditional practices and outdated ways of thinking .  They believe that only when they promote a certain number of activities can they receive wide attention and only when they hold a certain number of meetings can they show their great concern .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
Only by following leap-forward thinking for development ; building informationalized units while informationalizing our units step by step at the same time ; and raising our country 's strategic deterrent and war deterrent will it be possible to provide reliable guarantee for fighting and winning a future hi-tech war .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .  
and opened up China 's future .  It was their great thinking , noble character , and immortal achievements that inspired us to carry forward the revolutionary cause pioneered by our predecessors and courageously forge ahead into the future .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents " pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party must become a true representative of the needs of developing China 's advanced social production forces , of the course of progressing China 's advanced culture , and of the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .  
During this centralized education , Party members and cadres in grassroots units meticulously studied the important thinking of the " three represents , " touched on and solved some problems that are incongruous with the needs of the Party 's advanced nature , improved their ideological conscientiousness , and inspired their revolutionary will to fight .  
The second generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at its core as well as the third generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core restored , upheld and advanced the ideological line of " emancipate one 's thinking , be practical and realistic " , and led the entire party and the entire Chinese people in concentrating efforts on reforms and opening to the outside world , such that China has been seeing miraculous economic and social growth .  
The resolution of key and difficult problems certainly does not lie in shouting slogans more loudly .  It lies in starting out with a recognition of reality , revolving around real problems of widespread concern to the broad masses of officers and soldiers , thinking of practical moves , taking real action , and working steadily and surely to solve the problems .  
All in all , to continuously accelerate reform and construction in the military and fulfill the sacred mission , the military must vigorously promote the spirit of emancipating their thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of closely following the development of the era and innovating courageously , the spirit of unswervingly marching forward despite difficulties , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness , and the spirit of disregarding personal fame and interests , being unselfish and dedicating oneself .  
Sun Yanling , a farmer at the outskirts of Bengbu City , Anhui , lost her life because she left her treatment of illness to " Falungong . "  According to statistics , obsessed by Li Hongzhi 's warped theories and heretical thinking , more than 1,600 people have died because of suicides or because they refused to be treated by a doctor for their illnesses ; 651 people have developed psychological problems ;  
In short , every division of the armed forces should like the Party Committee of the Air Force emancipate their thinking , update their conceptions and promote a reformative and innovative spirit by launching as many competitive policies and measures as possible so that the military will really become a " warm land " attracting the majority of China 's excellent scientific and technological specialists .  
In order to implement Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong army with science and technology and to fully mobilize enthusiasm and creativity of professional and technological cadres , with the approval of the Central Military Commission , the four general departments have jointly issued a circular on raising relevant treatment for some senior experts in our army as of this year .  
What stirred Peng Qin deeply at a later time was the moral lessons given by two former " Falungong " practitioners on the basis of their own experiences , whom the provincial reeducation-through-labor center had released before the due date .  Ever since then , Peng Qin started to calm down and do some serious thinking .  Little by little , she recalled the path that she had covered over the previous three years ;  
Not only has it been innovative in adopting new ideological concepts and modes of thinking in carrying out its domestic construction , it has also changed the isolationism of its past foreign policy , enthusiastically taking the initiative in developing relations with various countries .  
The thinking of " three represents , " with its profound meaning expressed in simple and concise language , is a new summary of the party 's nature , aim and fundamental tasks .  It is a new development of the Marxist theory of party building and a new requirement placed by the new situation on party organizations and party cadres at all levels .  It is also the root of the party , the foundation of the administration and the source of strength .  
Deputies Shi Yuxiao and Zhang Guochu held that today , facing the new task of regarding economic construction as the central task , the important thinking of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has given a highly refined interpretation in fundamentally answering the questions of how to build the party , what kind of party to build , and how to act well as the " force at the core " in leading the cause of socialist modernization in the new historical conditions .  
To continuously advance military construction and reform , fulfill the sacred mission placed on the shoulders of our military , we must carry forward the spirit of emancipating thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of keeping up with the times and courageously innovating , the spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness and the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career .  
Tang Dongcheng , known as the Defuser , has made some astounding achievements defusing bombs .  Being extremely responsible to the Party , to people and protecting the interests of others wholeheartedly is reflected in his excellence in defusing bombs .  He deserves our sincere respect and the honor of being selected as a model for practicing Chairman Jiang 's important thinking embodied in the " three represents . "  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has scientifically summed up the historical experiences of the world socialist movement and of our party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction , and creatively put forward the important thinking on " three represents , " thus answering in scientific fashion a series of major issues that we face in stepping up party building in the new situation .  
We should profoundly understand the great significance of studying , and practicing the important thinking on " three represents " from the level of " the foundation of building the party , the basis of ruling the country , and the source of strength , " vigorously step up ideological and political building , and ensure that the important thinking on " three represents " is truly implemented in building national defense and the armed forces .  
Deputy Guo Jinlong said : To implement the economic and social objectives set by the autonomous regional party committee for the coming five years , the cadres and people of all nationalities in Tibet will work hard in the six aspects : First , further break seclusion , improve service , and create a good investment soft environment with innovations in thinking and structure as the guide .  
Therefore , we must , through constant efforts , further liberalize thinking , renew ideas , expand efforts to open up to the outside , seize opportunities , and accelerate development so as to bring more visible and tangible benefits to the Tibetan people and increasingly improve the material and cultural standard of living for the people .  
Seize the opportunity created by global restructuring , speed up structural readjustment , effect the two fundamental changes , and maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  Such is the new thinking on economic development during the Tenth Five-Year Plan . It is the concrete expression of our intent to make development the keynote as well as a prominent feature of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo pointed out : The current education drive is an important move and practical step taken on the basis of positive education in " three stresses " carried out in party committees at the regimental level and grassroots units of the armed forces to further study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " , improve the quality of the ranks of party members , and strengthen party building in the armed forces .  
Therefore , our military 's attitude toward the recent international focus of topics on Aegis frigates is of a very low key , thinking the heated debate of this topic will not help Taiwan obtain the Aegis frigates .  Furthermore , the Ministry of National Defense indirectly expressed its hope that the domestic military media will lighten the report on this issue .  
The central authorities ' decision to carry out study and educational activities in rural areas throughout the country concerning the important thinking of the " three represents " is an important basic project to step up and improve the party 's leadership over rural work , to deepen rural reform , and boost rural economic and social development , as well as a strategic measure to step up the building of the work style of rural grass-roots cadres .  
Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .  
This Opinion regards Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " as the guideline , gives an eye on the reality of the party-building in the military and explicitly proposes the guiding principle , fundamental objective , major tasks and detailed requirements on extensively promoting throughout the military an educational campaign to maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
Hence , the whole process of this study and education drive must be based on arming the rural grassroots cadres with the important thinking on " three represents " ; in particular , it is essential to strengthen their concept of wholeheartedly serving the people , improve their ability to carry out agricultural restructuring and develop rural economy , strengthen their ability to do mass work well in the new situation , and enhance their consciousness of persistently " grasping things with both hands , and firmly with both hands . "  
Powell was the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff . And his thinking for directing military operations is characteristically built on clear principles of national interests , superior military forces , and minimum casualties and the explicit principle of withdrawal .  
Some analyses say that the PRC fighter intentionally struck the American craft , thinking to force the US plane to land on Chinese soil .  Some people also say that the American plane made a sudden turn toward the Jian-8 as though it were a bicycle moving forward of its own volition .  It is difficult to grasp the distances at which fighter planes pass at high speeds , where a tiny slip can mean a crash and death to the crew .  
The US military , which was the first to advance and put into practice the idea of joint operations , was also once restricted by the thinking a " unitary service " ; yet through academic debates and the run-in of a series of war practices , a fairly complete system of principles and theories on joint operations has finally taken shape , and is now undergoing constant development .  
If the Japanese young people and children , beginning from thejunior high school textbooks , learn that " the aggression was reasonable , " " thewar was creditable , " and the aggression war was a " need " and was " aimed atterminating the colonial destiny of Asia " from the history " education , " then itis undoubtedly wishful thinking that can never be realized to hope that Chinaand Japan will keep a more peaceful and friendly relationship in futurecooperation and that Asia will enjoy a long-lasting stable environment for itsdevelopment .  
According to the spirit of the central economic work conference and the Fourth Session of the Ninth National People 's Congress , the meeting analyzed the current situation , unified people 's thinking , and set forth the main tasks and key points for this year 's work .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
They should unite more closely around the party CentralCommittee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner ofDeng Xiaoping Theory , seriously implement the important thinking of " threerepresents , " strengthen the party building and improve the ideological andpolitical levels of the military , and provide a powerful spiritual motivationand reliable political guarantee for " winning in wars " and " neverdegenerating . "  
The important thinking of " three represents " has provided scientific theoretical guidance to building a contingent of army cadres , so we must put into effect this important thinking in a comprehensive way in the training and selection of cadres to guarantee that the barrels of guns are always held in the hands of the reliable persons loyal to the party .  
This thinking is a succinct summary of the correct world outlook , outlook on life , and concept on value for the communist party members , which has reflected the demands on cadres by the new situation and tasks , and embodied the unity in the criteria for political integrity and professional competence .  
Comrade Wang Wei was an outstanding representative of contemporary Chinese youths .  He epitomized the characteristics of the young generation of our time - - ambitious , eager to learn , bold in practice , always thinking about the interests of the motherland , and keen to serve the people .  He is the example whom the youths of all ethnic groups throughout the country in the new period should learn from .  
The meeting required that party committees and organization departments at all levels should further unify thinking , enhance understanding , improve the style of work , effectively guarantee the fulfillment of the assignments , seize the opportune moment when local leading bodes at various levels will be changed , and raise the work of selecting , promoting , and training young cadres to a new level .  
Zeng Qinghong pointed out : In commanding various rural work with the important thinking of " three represents , " we must devote major efforts to advancing the building of socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and the legal system and safeguarding social stability in the countryside to provide an ideological guarantee and good sociopolitical environment for rural economic and social development .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " profoundly reveals the age-oriented meaning of the Party 's advanced nature in light of this new period , provides the fundamental theoretical basis for correctly carrying forward the advanced nature of Party members , allows us to understand this nature from a new angle and raises our understanding to a higher level .  
Yu Yongbo presided at the gathering .  He demanded that the units of the entire armed forces take Comrade Wang Wei as their example , consciously practice the important thinking on " three represents " proposed by Chairman Jiang Zemin , vigorously promote the modernization of the armed forces , do a sound job in preparatory work for military struggle , comprehensively enhance our army 's capability to successfully fight a modern war , especially a partial war under hi-tech conditions , and make new contributions to defending and building the motherland .  
It urged them to learn from Wang Wei 's lofty thinking and character of selflessly dedicating himself , devoting himself to his assignment , not being concerned for personal gains and losses , and not being moved by fame and money ; and to self-consciously subject themselves to and serve the general interests of reform and construction , nurture good morality and sentiment , establish lofty goals , and maintain the steadfastness , faithfulness , and moral integrity of a revolutionary soldier .  
It is reported that running in-depth education study classes are mainly aimed at meeting the needs of giving additional knowledge to former " Falungong " practitioners who have basically been reformed through persuasion , changing their mode of thinking , and exploring a law governing ideological and political work in the new age .  
Extensively promoting the educational campaign to study and put into practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of Party members is an important task of the military 's political work for this year , which was decided in accordance with the directive of the Central Military Commission . It also is an important measure and realistic procedure for improving the quality of Party members and strengthening Party-building throughout the military .  
It is necessary to strengthen education in the party 's basic line and education on General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " so that the vast number of grass-roots judicial administrators and police officers will more firmly adopt a correct outlook on the world and on life and adopt a set of correct values , and will work faithfully in law enforcement , provide enthusiastic services for the people , and keep their own conduct upright and incorruptible .  
A correct understanding of the strategic developments and changes under the new historical conditions , a scientific strategic outlook , and , in particular , a broader and more profound strategic vision and more enterprising strategic thinking are indispensable to understanding the basic trend of strategic developments .  
The leading cadres at all levels in all localities must seriously study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " be faithful representatives of the development requirements of the advanced social productive forces and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , and fully understand the harm done by regional blockades .  
The work in all fields must aim at heightening fighting spirit , stimulating morale , unifying thinking , and rallying forces , and it must also aim at firmly grasping a correct orientation , promoting reform and development , and safeguarding social stability .  
Meanwhile , we must also notice that the burden is heavy and the road is long in cracking down on Mafia-style gang crimes .  What the ordinary people fear most is that we might carry out the struggle for the short term , passing like a gust of wind , and then give it up halfway .  Therefore , all localities and departments must unify their thinking and understanding on the central spirit , buttress confidence , strive still harder and press ahead , and unceasingly carry out the strike-hard struggle in depth .

Pay attention to intensifying the effort to analyze Western currents of political and cultural thinking , so as to reveal their reactionary nature , to make clear their decadent and harmful character , to enhance the sense of concern and the capacity to resist corruption and change , and to control armed forces ideologically and politically .  
While progressive thinking and advanced ideas are being formed and developed , various decadent ideas and cultural elements have also been taking this opportunity to achieve infiltration , with idealism , pseudo-science , and anti-Marxist currents of political thinking raising their heads and once-eradicated ugly social phenomena appearing to be resurrected ; the corrosive effects and influence on officials ' and soldiers ' minds should not be underestimated .

Due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure China 's political and social problems .  As a result , the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created .  In fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .  
He emphasized the necessity of giving prominence to key points , linking with the reality of the armed forces , closely centering around the two historical themes of " being able to win " and " not changing color " facing the PLA , thinking deeply about how to keep abreast of the new trends in the world 's military development and how to bring about development in big strides in the modernization of the armed forces , and putting forward suggestions and proposals that show real knowledge and deep insight .  
Faced with the challenge of a new century , the fiscal budget announced yesterday farsightedly called for " taking advantage of global economic integration " and " firmly grasping excellent opportunities in the hinterland to open the door to prosperity " and this has reflected new thinking and a new style in a period of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong .  
By recruiting qualified personnel from the public and reinforcing its professional contingent , the government is bound to drastically alter its way of thinking , way of doing things , and service quality and this will give a forceful impetus to Hong Kong 's robust economic recovery and help turn Hong Kong into an international commercial metropolis .  
As the Chinese military begins to pay close attention to its modernization and strives to catch up to and surpass others in every military aspect , there is a book circulating in China entitled " Chao Xian Zhan " ( " Unrestricted Warfare " ) .  It advances a tactic known as " unrestricted warfare , " and although this is neither a mature thought nor a formal line of thinking in the Chinese military , it nevertheless has evoked broad repercussions .  
If the leader of the Taiwan authorities engages in wishful thinking that he can use a vague , dilatory , and evasive style to relegate the problem to the future , and throw the problem to foreign powers and the international community , the result will be something that he can not bear to imagine .  
The separatist forces have disregarded the historical trend of China 's reunification , and pleaded with foreign forces in a vain attempt to bring about " Taiwan independence . "  This is completely a futile effort out of their wishful thinking .  
She held that " the greatest obstacle to Taiwan 's future is not just the KMT 's thinking on great reunification but , still more , the CPC 's wishful thinking to define in nationalist terms Taiwan as its province and its ambition to achieve reunification of great China , " " the CPC knows too little about Taiwan , and reunification is wishful thinking , " " the CPC is the Taiwan people 's main ultimate opponent , " and " Taiwan must absolutely not take the CPC lightly . "  
He emphasized that comrades working for the NPC must conscientiously and assiduously study Marxist theory and acquire various kinds of specialized knowledge in order to improve their ideological and theoretical quality and do their job with flying colors .  In particular , they must use Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " to guide the NPC 's work , ensuring that these are fully embodied in legislation , supervision and the decision of important matters .  
Young people are in their prime , their thinking is quick , they readily accept new things , and they have an abundance of creative spirit , but the spirit of science must be firmly established , they must work hard to dig into scientific knowledge , and they must have the far-sighted aspiration of contributing their own youth and knowledge to the motherland and the people .  
Li Lanqing said at the end : To popularize scientific knowledge across the whole society , to establish scientific thinking , to promote scientific spirit , and to publicize scientific methods suit the need for implementing the strategy of developing China through science and education , for upgrading the masses ' qualities , and for facilitating a healthy development in our socialist material and spiritual civilization construction .  The tasks also suit the need for eliminating the poison inflicted by ignorance , superstition , various pseudosciences , and antisciences ; for safeguarding social stability ;  
However , the industrial and commercial circle of Taiwan could not therefore set their minds at rest .  In their thinking , it is absolutely not a simple thing that Ch'en Shih-meng , an official for the " quasi-cabinet " and a long-term advisor to Chen Shui-bian [ Chen Shuibian ] in financial and economic issues , posed the idea of collecting " national security tax " twice in one month , the period from May to early June . The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
The circular demands that through implementing the legislation law , the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments should further standardize government legislative activities , improve the quality of government legislative work , and thus spur government legislative work to express still more comprehensively and accurately General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents , " so that government legislative work , execution of laws , and supervision of execution of laws can rise to a new level .  
Wen Jiabao called for the governments at all levels and pertinent departments in the disaster areas to firmly bear in mind the party 's fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly , deepen their understanding of the anti-drought work from the high plane of stressing political awareness , be eager to meet the needs of the masses , think about what the masses are thinking about , and do a good job of providing relief to the disaster areas with warmth and enthusiasm in a solid manner .  
The PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] General Political Department the other day issued a circular demanding that the party committees and political organs at all levels further unify ideological understanding ; strengthen organization and leadership ; earnestly guide in an all-round way the positive education on " three stresses " with Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " ; and see to it that the education will yield tangible results .  
The circular demanded : We should deepen theory study by taking the important thinking of " three represents " as a core content and should further deepen understanding of the basic theoretical view of " three stresses , " and invigorate and grasp study in a down-to-earth manner in light of the characteristics at the grass-roots level and in various forms . 
It is not the product of wishful thinking that China and the United States should work for establishing a " constructive strategic partnership . "  It is based on their common needs .  It helps the governments of the two countries to grasp the major orientation in developing bilateral relations .  
The Chinese people have generally practiced pacifism and have the thinking and natural instincts of assuming the defensive .  These are integrated with their strong traditional ideology of blood relationship and their special social crowd structure .  One of the results of this humane culture is that hegemonism which is aimed at invading other countries will be difficult to develop .  
The exposition of " three represents " has pointed out a correct orientation for our realization of the party 's general objective of construction under the new situation , and is therefore a great guideline for our efforts to comprehensively strengthen the party building ; moreover , it will surely guide our way of thinking , and will encourage us to exert ourselves to make the country prosperous and strong , to forge ahead in an innovative spirit , and to build our party into a stronger and more powerful party full of youthful spirit .  
In accordance with the requirements of Chairman Jiang 's " Two Armings " , the entire military , on the basis of conducting ideological theoretical arming , has put great efforts into strengthening modern science and technology arming , especially arming with high technology knowledge , actively transforming concepts , adjusting work thinking , and putting the focus on cultivating personnel , creating talent , and comprehensively raising the quality of officers and soldiers .  
Facing new situations and tasks , ideological and political development has shouldered heavy responsibilities .  The troops in the entire army will take Chairman Jiang 's important thinking regarding the " three represents " as the guide , constantly reforming , being brave in innovating , and industriously opening up a new page in military ideological and political work .  
Meeting participants , using Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking " Three Represents " as guidance and targeting current prominent issues in public order , studied and put forward suggestions to improve comprehensive management of the social order .  
Conscientious adherence to the requirements set forth in the " Three Represents , " earnestly doing well in various aspects of work in comprehensive management of public order , maintaining social stability , creating an excellent environment for reform and development are where the fundamental interests of the broad mass of the people lie , which is also the concentrated realization of the comprehensive management of public order 's implementation of the important thinking of the " Three Represents . "  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
7 .  The cultural , trade and economic , public security , information industry , foreign trade and economic affairs departments , customs houses , and administrations for industry and commerce at various levels must unify their thinking , increase their awareness , and further define their own functions and responsibilities .  Under the leadership of the local party committee and government , they must assume their responsibilities , closely coordinate with each other , and earnestly carry out their own administrative work and strengthen their routine supervision and management .  
The speech was one of great foresight , profound thinking , incisive exposition , and rich content , containing many new thoughts and new viewpoints .  It constitutes an important Marxist document of strategic , overall , and farsighted nature , and it has the important significance of providing guidance on strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work , on comprehensively strengthening party building , and on advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
We must strengthen our investigations and studies of the trend of social thinking as well as the characteristics and the rules of changes in thinking among young officers and soldiers .  We must strengthen our studies on major theoretical and practical issues that will have impacts on the thinking activities among officers and soldiers .  We should have an initiative in carrying out the ideological and political work .  
She hoped all cadres and people of Guizhou will further seek unity of thinking on reform and opening up , change concepts , increase understanding , maintain a good spirit , seize the historical opportunity for developing the western region , make progress on one 's own initiative , make unremitting efforts to improve oneself , and work hard in a down-to-earth manner .  
Wu Shih-wen pointed out : President Chen [ Ch'en Shui-pien ] ' s idea of " fighting a decisive offshore battle " is also an army building rationale the Nationalist forces have all along upheld , which differs in no way in spirit from such a strategic thinking as " effective deterrent , tenacious defense . "  
The thinking of a " decisive battle offshore " and any overconfident military and political provocations are no doubt nonsensical and crazy practices and a risk that invites self-destruction .  Some people in Taiwan should rein in on the brink of the precipice .  
It was learned that the age limit for various leading posts set by the party Central Committee this time is mainly to make cadres younger and more intelligent and raise the quality of the ranks of cadres .  In the mean time , it is designed to enable new cadres to receive promotion earlier and encourage leading cadres of various units to adopt new thinking in their administration .  
In recent years , the Taiwan authorities led by Lee Teng-hui carried out armaments expansions without restraint , stressing augmenting the Taiwan armed forces ' control of the air and command of the sea by relying on the geographical position of an isolated island and under the guidance of the military thinking of " active defensive and effective deterrence . "  The Air Force 's special budget for the purchase of F-16 and " Mirage-2000 " fighters alone was as high as $ 12 billion .  
Chi Haotian emphasized that we should unswervingly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army , vigorously strengthen the ideological and political building of troops , earnestly study Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , earnestly study a series of expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin , resolutely implement President Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents , " continue conducting the " three stresses " education in a profound way , enhance the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , and keep the political color of our army forever .  
However , an analysis of Taiwan 's military combat capability , especially of its naval and air forces , will readily show that the Taiwan military 's so-called " decisive battle offshore " can only be described as a dangerous and dubious wishful thinking .  
Labor models and advanced workers are the outstanding representatives of China 's working class and millions upon millions of the laboring masses .  They are the vanguards of the building of material and spiritual civilization .  Their advanced thinking and exemplary deeds fully manifest the lofty style and spirit of China 's working class .  
The Central Organization Department and the Central Propaganda Department jointly held in Beijing today a report meeting on the educational activities of " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich . "  The meeting reviewed and exchanged the experience gained in conducting the " double thinking " educational activities in the previous stage , analyzed and studied their developments , and made specific plans and arrangements for the next stage of " double thinking " educational work .  
Judging from these reports , the " double thinking " educational activities in the previous stage went on smoothly and achieved initial successes because the leaders attached importance to them and because they were integrated with the reality and were conducted in numerous forms .  
During a 16 June military review , the new leader in Taiwan put forward for the first time the strategic thinking of " fighting decisive battle outside Taiwan . " He also instructed the military to enhance its information warfare capability , develop air-to-ground missiles and other offensive weaponry , set up a special agency for the development of " space weapon system , " deploy for the first time guided missile boats to the Kinmen front , and conduct live-warhead missile launching exercise .  
Over the last several months , various localities , organized by the Central Organization Department and the Central Propaganda Department in an unified way , have thoroughly implemented the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , carried out the " double thinking " educational activities in a concentrated way , and achieved a preliminary success .  
The localities generally say that to carry out educational activities on " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich " meets the objective need of China 's economic and social development , these activities are a profound ideological emancipation and mobilization at the turn of the centuries , and they are the important contents and effective carrier of the efforts to strengthen and improve the ideological and political work under new circumstances .  
Facts show that so long as people 's thinking and understanding are enhanced , the " double thinking " education will be warmly supported by the broad cadres and masses and be generally carried out in the vast urban and rural areas .  
Through the " double thinking " education , we should guide people to think out a way to enhance our confidence , vigor , cohesion and fighting power , set a correct direction , objective and working concept for our region , department and organization , and promote coordinated economic , social and cultural development by a higher standard .  
So long as we seize the opportune time to implement the spirit of the central ideological and political work conference , seriously sum up our successful experience of the preceding stage , and earnestly overcome the weak links in our work , we will certainly be able raise the " double thinking " educational activities to a higher level .  
It has thus aroused the cadets ' sense of mission and responsibility .  In addition , it has encouraged the cadets to become new-type military personnel capable of operating high-tech equipment by promoting the thinking of " letting well-trained people wait to be equipped rather than having equipment ready but without well-trained people to operate it . "  
He expressed the hope that scientific and research personnel in general would further emancipate their thinking , intensifying reforms , enhancing their science and technology innovations in prospective , basic , and strategic areas , intensifying their efforts to do a good job of attracting , training , and employing outstanding talent , concentrating their efforts on the promotion of independent innovation , and doing an even better job in the intellectual innovation pilot project .  
He said : In his half-century revolutionary career , Comrade Su Yu performed immortal feats for the liberation of the Chinese people , and made important contributions to building a modern and regularized revolutionary army ; strengthening the national defense of the New China ; and enriching and developing Mao Zedong military thinking , leaving behind him an everlasting monument and a precious legacy .  
In their speeches , they stressed the need to unify thinking with central strategic policy decisions and to be more aware of politics , the overall situation , and responsibility .  In line with the unified arrangement of the party Central Committee and the State Council , we should conscientiously make plans , work in a down-to-earth manner , avoid practicing formalism , and realistically do a good job of guiding , protecting , and bringing into play the enthusiasm and creativeness of the broad masses of the cadres and the people .  
In order to deepen the study and carry out in a comprehensive way Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's theory on democratic legal system and General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of the " three represents , " the NPC Standing Committee held a study class for chairmen of the people 's congress standing committees at provincial level in Beijing from 25 to 28 September .  
Jia Qinglin stressed : Now , the IOC 's final voting for the Olympic hosting city is less than 10 months away .  The time is pressing while our task is heavy .  Leading cadres at all levels in Beijing Municipality should achieve unity in thinking and understanding on the basis of the spirit of the central leading comrades ' instructions .  
Remarkable changes have been noticed in the ideological thinking , discipline , and work style of the country 's police contingent ; the unifying force and the competitive effectiveness of the contingent have both been enhanced on a constant basis ; and the vast numbers of public security personnel and police officers have stood the test of severe and complicated struggles , and have made outstanding contribution to safeguarding the state security , to ensuring a sound social and political stability , and to maintaining a stable public order .  
It has focussed on the major theories and practical issues related to the preparations for military struggle , thus further defining the orientation and thinking of deepening the training of troops through science and technology .  The training of troops through science and technology represents a profound revolution in the military affairs of China 's armed forces at the end of the 20th century .  
The whole army should use as its guidance Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " as well as on strengthening the armed forces and improving their training through science and technology .  In light of the military strategic principle in the new period as well as the goal of realizing the preparations for military struggle , the whole army should continuously deepen its ideological understanding .  In addition , the whole army should ensure that it follows correct orientation during the whole process of training of troops through science and technology .  
We should fully unfold education on fighting corruption and building a clean government , wage the struggle against corruption in great depth , establish a sound supervisory and administrative system , and use correct thinking , system and mechanism to curb corrupt practices in the light of the new situation , the new characteristics and the new rules of the anti-corruption struggle under the socialist market economy .  
Leaders at all levels must unify their thinking and bring it in line with the spirit of the Central Committee , truly grasp the promotion of the reforms of the basic medical insurance system for urban workers and the medical and health system as a task of fundamental importance with a close bearing on the overall situation , see to it that people 's understanding , leadership and measures are in place and that work is carried out where it really matters .  
Therefore , conscientious study , thorough understanding , and overall implementation of the thinking and requirements of the " three represents " will be of tremendous practical and far-reaching guiding significance to comprehensively carrying forward the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , comprehensively promoting the new , great project of the party building , and comprehensively fulfilling the three major tasks in the new century .  
Xiang Huaicheng demanded : With the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , comrades engaged in fiscal work must conscientiously change their mentality by changing their thinking from that of the planned finance in the past to that of public finance . 
At present , women 's federations should particularly do a good job in conducting education in current situation and policies , education in socialist ethics , and education in Marxist materialism , atheism and scientific approach in light of the progress of reform and development and the actual thinking of women ; and guide the broad masses of women to further firm their belief in Marxism , their faith in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , their confidence in reform , opening up and modernization , and their trust in the party and the government .  
What is particularly important is that the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee concentrated the wisdom of the entire party and approved the " Proposals of the CPC Central Committee on Drawing up the 10th Five-year Plan of Economic and Social Development , " which proposed the guiding thinking , goals of endeavor , and major measures for economic and social development in the next five to 10 years , united the will of the whole party , and specified the orientation for advance .  
Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's strategic thinking characterized by its broad and long-term view , the Party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , established Shanghai 's strategic position and asked the municipality to be turned into an international economic , financial , and trade center as soon as possible .  
Shanghai 's decision-makers began to open the gate to liberalize their thinking and lost no time in coming up with a new industrial strategy to " give priority to developing the tertiary industry , readjust and transform the secondary industry , and steadily upgrade the primary industry . "  It boldly changed the several-decade-old " 2-3-1 " industrial development order to the " 3-2-1 " order .  
To implement the structural readjustment guiding policies of " give-and-take " and " do something versus do nothing , " Shanghai liberated its thinking , broadened its field of vision , and used reform to set up two highly maneuverable " mechanisms " : One is the motive mechanism that lets the inferior trades and money-losing enterprises get out of the market .  
Even though the specific behaviors of and causes of the problems of some leading bodies and leading cadres in the aspect of party spirit and party styles are not completely identical , they are all directly related to their insufficient theoretical study .  To resolve these problems , it is imperative to arm their mind with theory and base themselves upon study and improvement .  Though discussions , they have unified their thinking and understanding and taken an active part in the theoretical study .  
When carrying out education on the " three stresses , " the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee has remained in close contact with the reality of state-run enterprise reform , has enhanced its understanding , has united its thinking , and has adopted vigorous measures in the areas of adjusting structures , reforming organizations and systems , and focusing on the restructuring of large enterprises while giving free hand to small ones .  It has provided a powerful force for promoting reform of the state-run enterprises and for extricating them from their difficulties .  
After going through the " three stresses " campaign , the thinking of every locality is much more free and the spirit is much more inspired ; conspicuous problems , problems of hotspots , and problems of difficult points that all appeared in the process of reform and development have been solved ; the cohesive power and fighting strength of Party organizations have been strengthened ;  
He said , the united front work conference convened by the CPC Central Committee was a meeting in which the CPC further enhanced and deepened understanding of the important status and role of the united front , unified the thinking of the whole party , and deployed and mobilized the whole party to attach importance to united front work ; it is of great significance in the history of the united front under CPC leadership in carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the future .  
Leaders of all localities and departments must take Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " three represents " thinking as a guidance and , with their boundless love for the people and in a highly responsible spirit , go deep into the grassroots units and among the masses to carefully see by themselves what difficulties are being experienced by the people .  They should help the masses solve these difficulties and promptly discover and correct any other problems so as to maintain our social stability and ensure the development of the economy .  
Our double-support work should meet the demand of the important thinking on the " three represents , " take the development of our social productive forces and the enhancement of our troops ' combat effectiveness as our fundamental starting point and standpoint .  We should follow the important principle of treating well the relations involving our army , government and civilians from the high plane of stressing politics , so that their unity will constantly consolidate and develop and make a still greater contribution to our reform , opening up and socialist modernization .  
Schools must actively mobilize themselves , proceed on the basis of their own situations , study and formulate realistic and feasible plans for logistical socialization and reform , transform ideas , thoroughly eliminate the old way of thinking of higher education of taking on everything in society , resolutely break free from traditional logistical management models , and set up a new type of logistical safeguard system for higher education that is suited to the national situation of China .  
Experiences leading to the gratifying situation in the air force 's flight safety record are varied and can chiefly be summed up as follows .  First , all air force units always insist on applying the new period 's military strategic thinking in managing things , placing military training at the center of all work , giving priority to flight training arrangements , and well maintaining continuity in flight and in training course .  Second is persistence in subjecting units to tough and strict training .  
We must fully understand the great guiding significance of the important " three represents " thinking to promoting good party style and ethical integrity and to deepening the anti-corruption struggle .  We must work according to the " three represents " requirements , conceive , plan and do the work of combating corruption and encouraging ethical integrity by even higher standards , further raise the level of our ideological understanding and work guidance , constantly further the work of promoting good party style and ethical integrity , and score even greater success in it .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " was precisely put forward from the high ground of the future and destiny of the party and state on the basis of a sober understanding and accurate grasp of the domestic and international situation , the historical tasks shouldered by the party and the reality of party building , as well as on the basis of a thorough analysis and profound summary of the positive and negative experiences of the building of proletarian political parties , especially the building of our own party .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents " shows in a concentrated way the character , purpose and fundamental tasks of our party .  It is the basis for our party building , the foundation of our holding office , and the source of our strength .  The party organizations at all levels of the central government organs and the vast numbers of party members should thoroughly comprehend the theoretical contents and practical requirements of this important thinking , and conscientiously apply it in guiding their own thinking and action .  
China is a vast country with a population of over 1.2 billion people , and broadcasting has close ties with the thinking , work and life of the masses .  The role of broadcasting can not be overlooked or replaced in the urban and rural areas , especially in the remote agricultural and pastoral areas .  Broadcasting has a great promise and a great future .  
The meeting stressed : The central authorities ' decision that county and city departments and village cadres across the country must carry out the education program of studying the important thinking concerning the " three represents . "  This is an important policy decision for improving grassroots cadres ' competence and increasing the coherence and militancy of grassroots party organizations in the rural areas under the new situation .  It is also an important move for strengthening and improving the party 's leadership over rural affairs and promoting rural areas ' economic development and social progress .  
Wu Yi , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and state councilor , sent a letter to the conference and delivered a written speech .  She asked all customs offices in the country to take the important thinking of " three represents " as guidance , administer customs in a strict manner , deepen reform , and turn China 's customs into scientific , civilized , honest , efficient and modernized customs .  
Li Tieying pointed out in his speech , at the historic moment of the turn of the century , standing at the plane of historical materialism , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " has made a new and scientific summation of our party 's nature , purpose , and tasks , and embodied the innovative spirit of making efforts to open up new realms in Marxism geared to the 21st century .  
We must vigorously propagate and popularize scientific knowledge , scientific thinking , and scientific methods ; guide the masses of cadres in building scientific , civilized , and healthy social trends and fine lifestyles ; and constantly meet the growing cultural needs of the masses of peasants , thereby promoting the two civilizations in the rural area .  
Now , Chen Shui-bian has made the three-step proposal of " from economic and trade integration to cultural integration and further to political integration " which sublates the bipolar thinking between reunification and independence and attempts to lay a foundation of mutual-benefit for cross-strait relations and build a new framework of interaction for long-term peace .  This is a pragmatic thinking conducive to maintaining stability on the Taiwan Straits .  
The participants held that the eight proposals put forward in President Jiang Zemin 's important speech on developing cross-strait relations and pushing the motherland 's peaceful reunification represent the application and development in the new situation of Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's basic thinking on " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems , " and is a programmatic document and guiding idea for settling the Taiwan problem in the current stage .  
The party committees at all levels should fully understand the momentous and far-reaching significance of the current " study and education " activities , further integrate their thinking with the major policy decisions of the central authorities , use the idea of " three represents " to lead and assume overall responsibility for the agricultural and rural work , strengthen leadership , organize the work carefully , seek actual results , and have a good and firm grasp of the " study and education " activities conscientiously .  
The dissemination of scientific knowledge , scientific thinking , and scientific spirit will be a long-term and arduous task .  This state of affairs is out of step with the great cause of national revitalization that the Chinese nation is undertaking , so we must make concerted efforts to create a positive environment that is conducive to the healthy development of the awareness of innovation .  We should seize the great opportunity of implementing the 10th Five-Year Plan ;  
Luo Gan said : Over the past year , the procuratorial organs throughout the country conscientiously studied and worked hard to practice General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " continued to set strict demands on their work and the performance of their law enforcement duties , and obviously enhanced the level of fairness in law enforcement and improved the social image of the procuratorial personnel . 
The Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee held a forum today to study Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " running the country with virtue . "  According to their personal experiences and the characteristics of their respective work , some experts and scholars , comrades who had long been engaged in ideological and political work , and responsible officials of relevant departments in the capital talked glowingly about what they had gained from studying this important thinking .  
At a national conference of propaganda department directors held earlier this year , General Secretary Jiang Zemin clearly pointed out that in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , we must adhere to the important thinking on " governing the country according to law " and that on " running the country with virtue " simultaneously .  This has evoked tremendous repercussions among the people throughout the country .  
Those attending today 's forum unanimously held : Putting forward this important thinking is of profound theoretical and practical significance , and it is a scientific thesis reached on the basis of summing up foreign and domestic experiences in governing countries as well as an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory of states ; it is also an important overall strategy for running the country put forward at a time when our country is entering a new stage of economic and social development .  
In a written speech , Luo Guojie , professor at the Chinese People 's University , said : This thinking is an important theoretical development of socialist politics , ethics , and law , and it is bound to practically produce a positive influence on social stability and moral practice in our country and to greatly accelerate our drive for socialist modernization .  
He held : In carrying out moral construction , we must persistently guide ourselves with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the important concept of the " three represents " and firmly grasp various important links influencing the formation of people 's thinking and moral ideas ; in addition , we must make and implement concrete guiding plans and integrate the requirements of the basic moral ideas into relevant laws , regulations , and specific policies and into various social controls .  
A national forum for the members of the first batch of supervision and inspection groups concerning study and education activity of the important thinking of the " three represents " in rural areas has just concluded today .  This reporter has learned from the forum that upon the approval of central leading comrades , the first batch of six supervision and inspection groups , which are respectively headed by provincial-level veteran comrades , will soon leave for 12 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities to supervise and inspect the progress of the study and education activity there .  
Under the strong leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , take the important thinking on " three represents " as a guideline , keep firm confidence and soaring spirits , do down-to-earth work , get united to make progress , and strive to achieve our country 's grand objectives of reform , opening up , and modernization in the new century .  
Using high technologies , starting from on high to deal with China in the outer space to attract China 's attention , making it concentrate its entire financial , material and human resources , as the former Soviet Union did , on an arms race in the outer space .  Then , cutting the ground from under China 's foot , completely do China in .  Such kind of calculations based on wishful thinking , to be sure , is also very laughable .  
Based on the new situation at home and abroad , the tasks of the party , and the reality of party building , Comrade Jiang Zemin set forth his important thinking of " three represents . "  This has provided our party and state with a powerful ideological weapon for further understanding , improving , and developing themselves in the 21st century , which is imbued with challenges and hopes .  
During the past year , the NPC and its standing committee , in line with the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents , " earnestly performed the lofty responsibility entrusted to it by the Constitution and laws and made new progress in conducting legislative and supervisory work , and it carried out highly effective work and produced outstanding results in the endeavor to establish a rudimentary socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics and implement the basic plan of running the country according to law and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
Let us rally more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , meet the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents " in an all-round way , enhance our vigor and vitality , forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit , work in a down-to-earth manner , and exert ourselves in the struggle to achieve the goal of the 10th Five-year Plan and build an affluent , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
They should seriously implement the important " three represents " thinking , devote more efforts to political construction , and unswervingly arm their minds with Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the series of important theses by President Jiang so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation , consolidate the spiritual pillar , and build a strong mental defense line .  
Safeguarding the authority of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is our most cardinal political principle and discipline and represents the basic interests of the state , the nation , and the broad masses of people .  All officers and men of the PLA must have a highly unified thinking , maintain a very firm attitude , and act on their own initiative .  
Speaking on building stronger contingents of procuratorial personnel and improving their competency and law enforcing efficiency , Han Zhubin said : The National Procuratorial College , during the course of studying and implementing the important " three represents " thinking and working hard to improve the political awareness and professional competency of procuratorial personnel , trained more than 200 procuratorial officers before they were promoted to serve as chief procurators .  By the end of the year , local procuratorates also had trained one-third of their procuratorial officers on a rotational basis .  
Zhang Deguang said : Over more than 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the building of a democratic legal system has been strengthened constantly in our country , which has promoted the establishment of a socialist market economic system .  The thinking of governing the country by law has won support from the people .  
While talking about all these work results , the NPC deputies and CPPCC members also pointed out : We must pay close attention to the problem of an unbalanced growth among different areas during the course of the country 's economic development , and must help minority nationality areas broaden their way of thinking on the issue of developing their economy .  During the process of implementing the gist of the central authorities concerning the large-scale development of the country 's western region , we must lay special stress on achieving tangible results .  
Second , we must help minority nationality areas in the country 's western region change their traditional way of thinking on the issue of economic development , adopt the principle of " establishing finite targets , and making advances in some fields while retreating from others , " make a full use of the advantages of the country 's western region in having a biological diversity and a nationality diversity , and build up an industrial structure and systems that enjoy distinguishing local features .  
Promoting comprehensive economic and social development , properly building the material and spiritual civilizations , making efforts to promote the coordinated development of the urban and rural areas and of different regions , keeping economic development , population , resources , and the environment in line , and bringing about sustainable economic and social development are the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , are important expression of our party 's " three represents " thinking , and are also the direction for the process of socialist modernization which we must firmly grasp .  
We should follow the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory , earnestly study Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " conscientiously implement the spirit of the fifth plenary session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , further enhance the quality and effectiveness of the motion handling work through the joint efforts of the entire committee members , the CPPCC participant units , the CPPCC routine functional organs , and the motion recipient units , thus play a more positive role in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
should firmly and unremittingly tackle problems like impure thinking or erroneous styles among personnel concerned ; and should attach great importance to professional training for judges or procurators at the grassroots level by ensuring the greatest support for them in this regard , and by choosing and assigning the best teachers for them as well .  In order to heighten overall quality of judges or procurators , we must work hard for several years to come .  
To develop and invigorate a place , the key lies in whether or not the leading body can set an example for the rank-and-file and have a good ideological style , a correct line of thinking , and a correct direction .  The building of the ranks of public servants is of vital importance to establishing a good image for the government .  
The session called on the people of all ethnic groups in the country to rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , uphold the party 's basic line , use the important " three represents " thinking as a guidance , explore ways to advance , do solid work , and strive with one mind to implement the 10th Five-Year Plan and build China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
What is different from the previous plans is that the 10th Five-Year Plan regards raising the living standard of the broad masses as a basic point of departure .  It embodies the alignment of national planning with the people 's livelihood and is a plan that fully reflects General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents . "  
It holds fast to the crux of China 's modernization drive at the beginning of the new century and fully embodies the global views and strategic thinking of the party central committee .  Hence , it is the basic guiding principle which we must understand and take advantage of in the future economic and social development of China .  
Zeng Qinghong stressed : We must push forward in depth the study and education activity on the important thinking of " three represents " in rural areas , strive to meet the prescribed targets in real terms , and further make people 's ideological understanding on the activity conform to the requirements of the central authorities .  
The Republican-led government can not blindly imitate the China policies of the Clinton administration , nor can it go back to the doctrine of " strategic partnership . "  In the US , where politics is deeply partisan , such a shift is not without justification , but in reality the new US administration will not move in the direction of the other extreme , which would mean applying Cold War thinking to an emergent China and a wholesale repudiation of the positive results gained by the China policies of the previous administration .  
This decision is completely consistent with Bush 's line of thinking that we would do " whatever it took to defend Taiwan . " No wonder that Luo-de , former U.S . ambassador to China and assistant secretary of state for Asian-Pacific affairs during the Clinton administration believe that undoubtedly the Bush administration , which has assumed office for less than 100 days , is changing the established policy pursued by the previous administrations on the Taiwan issue .  
" As textbook is one of the resources to support teaching , its content should be impartial and factually correct to facilitate training of independent thinking and analytical skills amongst students .  " Thus , in December 1995 , basic principles and examples from a number of subjects were given to textbook publishers associations on textbook revision .  Those basic principles included ' revision should be kept to the minimum and complete revision of textbooks should be avoided ' .  
* To be a person who has deep love of our mother country and is committed to the development of the mainland as well as Hong Kong ; * To be biliterate and trilingual ; * To be a person with immense and extensive knowledge , independent thinking , creativity and enthusiasm ; and * To be a teacher who is caring and eager to serve our community and a person with lofty ideal and high moral standards , who is ready to shoulder the onus in the education of our younger generation . "  
To ride the tide of the New Economy , young people can no longer rely solely on their university diplomas for job security .  Apart from professional knowledge and communication skills , they need to possess vision , alterness , independent thinking and a proactive attitude .  Only when equipped with these qualities will they be able to see the wider picture of the changing social and economic environment and keep pace with the advancement in the new century .  
We need a workforce who have a strong sense of purpose ; who are knowledgeable and competent in the work they do ; capable of independent and critical thinking ; sensitive and responsive to change ; positive and resilient in the face of setbacks ; and creative in problem-solving .  
As for the longer-term challenges , Mr Tung said that central to our policy thinking and activities was how we could as a society best make the transition to a knowledge economy from our current starting point in the shortest time possible , ride the waves of progress of China with the greatest success and least economic and human dislocations , and adapt ourselves to the era of globalised competition and in the end come up with an economy that can perform brilliantly in the most demanding and competitive situations .  
( a ) An individual 's vulnerability to the development of emotional problems is affected by a variety of biological , psychological and socioeconomic factors , such as coexisting physical illness , a negative way of thinking in face of adversities or lack of social support .  
Speaking at the workshops is an experienced teacher in teaching children with special educational needs , Mrs Colette Wong , who has her training in specific learning difficulties at the Hornsby International Dyslexia Centre in London . At the workshops , Mrs Wong will share with participating teachers her practical experience and the teaching strategies to help students with specific learning difficulties in the areas of speech sound awareness , word recognition , reading strategies , information processing , memory skills and creative thinking .  
We need to develop a committed workforce of nurses who are capable of analytical thinking , and are ready to deliver high quality service based on updated professional knowledge and skills .  
Organised by the Curriculum Development Institute ( CDI ) of the Education Department , the Knowledge Fair covered such main themes as development of critical thinking and creativity through learning activities , assessment for learning to improve learning and teaching , and school-based curriculum development .  The four key tasks , namely project learning , reading to learn , moral and civic education , and information technology for interactive learning were also included .  
Ladies and gentlemen , I have enormous faith in our future .  That confidence is not based on wishful thinking .  It 's based on what I have just outlined - a clear understanding of our positioning , and a whole range of initiatives coming on stream over the next few years .  
" We have attached great importance to the moral and healthy development of our students .  Through a variety of learning activities , students are provided with amble opportunities to develop positive values and attitudes , healthy lifestyles and critical thinking skills to handle the problems arising from their daily encounters and social issues , " an EMB spokesman said .  
The former approach , used by athletes , falls under the psychological heading of image therapy . Requiring no physical activity to reach its goal , the method might be considered a type of positive thinking exercise . Pleasant experiences are reinforced , and negative stimuli are reduced to a bare minimum .  
Environmental thinking has entered our everyday lives . Housing advertisements , besides noting floor space and kitchen appliances as they did five or six years ago , are now apt to mention the residential environment as well - - " quiet neighborhood , " " green yard , " " swimming pool , " and so forth .  
Prosperity in economic development is foreseeable , but in addition to that , greater creativity and independence must be encouraged in education , greater receptivity to different ideas must be cultivated in thinking , and in culture , we must break free of following the obsolete trails of the West and search for a new direction in which to restore national consciousness .  
The Taiwan Photographic Society , whose motto was realism with a local color , and the Photographic Society of China , whose rallying cry was salon pictorialism , represented the two main streams of photography on Taiwan during the 1960s and 70s . Because of differences in viewpoint , language , and thinking , the two groups moved in different circles of activity and engaged in different spheres of endeavor .  
The result has been a change from unitary to pluralistic values , from closed ways of thinking to open ones , from moral and ethical considerations as a prime determinant of human relations to utilitarian and materialistic interests , from a simple and impoverished way of life to more prosperous and complex lifestyles .  
There have been evident achievements over the last thirty years enabling traditional thought to compete on good terms with the current of practical thinking , which gives hope that it will be able to become the leading current in the future .  
His words illustrate the type of thinking that lay behind the art of embroidery in ancient times . The use of celestial bodies and aspects of nature as designs for clothing reflects the harmony and fusion of man and nature . The flowery fowl is the brightly colored pheasant , the aquatic grasses express cleanliness , fire stands for illumination , and rice represents nourishment . Together the patterns are a symbol of the moral ideal of government , of concern over the destiny of mankind and compassion for the people .  
Given the influence of the thinking that ' man and the heavens each reflect the other , ' Chinese astronomical observation could never escape superstition , " explains Hwang Yi-nung , associate professor of History at Tsing Hwa University . When official astronomers witnessed an unusual celestial event , they would attach some forced political meaning to it , and rarely explored for the objective truth .  
In a less active sense , I hope that administrative personnel can be streamlined , that their level of quality can be raised , and that they can be more clean and honest . That is my thinking .  
Manufactured " through a meticulous and laborious process , sacrificial hogs still do not avoid the fate of being slaughtered , but they are used in a ceremonial rite before being divided up among the people involved and served in a big banquet shared with the gods . That is the aesthetic concept of " one-time use , " a concept that is quite prevalent in the thinking of today 's consumers ! (  
Under political party competition , society has the right to ask that the parties and the candidates they put forward have a high degree of ' political responsibility ' and meet the competitive ethics of party politics , " says Kao Hui-yu , a reporter for the United Daily News . Similarly , candidates need to promote a sense of public responsibility in order to change voters ' thinking from passive mobilization into active participation .  
Orchid Island is located about 49 nautical miles east of the city of Taitung . With education relatively late and travel inconvenient , much traditional culture and thinking is preserved .  
As part of this way of thinking , Chinese people strive to maintain a balance within the individual between the forces of yin and yang ( the dual principles of male and female , or positive and negative ) , which have influenced the concepts of hot and cold in Chinese food and medicine .  
Sharon Liu ( owner of the Colorful Farmer Co . , 35 , divorced , with two children ) I 've always been pretty traditional in my thinking . I was a typical " bride-to-be student " in junior college . I always thought that a woman 's place was in the home , and I wanted to be a good wife and parent just like my mother , so after I married I quit my job and concentrated on being a housewife .  
The problem is that our civil servants have not yet comprehended this shift , and are still stuck in the thinking and methods of the 1950 ' s . They just think about playing the leading role and telling others what they should do and ca n't do , which product to develop - - these are not official topics , so there are always conflicts with private entrepreneurs . In fact in many things the people are more capable than officials .  
Looking further ahead , " in fact , education for the gifted should n't be a monopoly of the elite , " teacher Lin Chih-chung says . " Everyone has the right to being trained in nonrigid thinking . It 's just that the system of big classes and the pressure to pass exams here have stifled most people 's potential and made gifted children such conspicuous exceptions . "  
What they shared in common was in showing new problems brought about by social development , such as conflicts between development and traditional ways of thinking or the adverse health effects of pollution and the fast pace of contemporary life brought about by industrialization . I feel the articles have a lot of reference value , because these situations are ones that the mainland is encountering or is going to encounter in the course of opening up .  
Though studying this or that ever since I was a child , I maintained a playful attitude and was always looking for something to throw myself into with all my heart , " Tsai recalls . After a teacher discovered that he had natural talent for the high jump in junior high school , he began to compete . At one time he had the junior high school record in the event , and he was crowned district champion . " And so I started thinking my life would be in track and field , " he says .  
From their talk , Tsai Jung-pin discovered that she had a good head on her shoulders . This clear thinking added to her slender body and agile movements gave her the potential of a smart athlete . She was a very polishable piece of rough jade , and Tsai was interested in putting her under his wing .  
It was not long before they came to accept this as natural - - if you wanted to get ahead then you had to actively take part in the League , national mass study organizations and social work . Moreover , there could be no questioning of communist thinking ; otherwise one would be seen as a rebel and expelled from the League , making further study impossible .  
But if cars can pass through on a new cross-island highway , people will just drive through , passing Yuli in an instant . " It 's like when the southern cross-island highway was built , " he says . " At first everyone at the eastern starting point of Haituan was vigorously in favor of opening the road , thinking that people would be able to get to Taitung in only an hour , but since then the city has been in gradual decline . "  
Under a situation that was too much even for the Cantonese character , renowned for its defiant tendency , the natives could only cause relatively minor disturbances for the British military , and the " shame of changing masters " became deeply embedded in their hearts . Yet the threads of nationalist thinking had not yet come together in the minds of the people .  
Last year , Diamonds in the Rough helped 10,000 graduates of junior high schools all over the province , each through individual guidance . The guidance counselor - - usually the child 's ninth grade counselor - - regularly telephones them each week and visits their homes or the places they study or work , listening to their heartfelt concerns , correcting their thinking and giving them information on finding jobs or continuing their schooling . How long does counseling have to go on before a case is considered closed ?  
I 'd get tired of thinking about it , and I was always frustrated . " Being interviewed at home , Lu is talking a bit fast and in a somewhat disorganized manner , but she is not at all the inarticulate dumb broad she is on the tube .  
But unless some major revisions are made to this promising star of tomorrow - - so you can fold it like an umbrella and store it away when not in use - - the electric car will provide no solution for traffic jams and parking hassles . Going to work electronically : Therefore , some people are casting aside the model of thinking wherein motion necessarily involves people , vehicles and roads to look for a substitute for vehicles .  
Associate professor Chung Wei-wen of National Chengchi University 's Graduate School of Journalism agrees with this judgement . Yet he still wants to wake up potential overseas students to the fact that knowledge is not a passive thing . When you go abroad , you can see the environment in all its pluralism and complexity , but if you do not have the ability to make acute observations and just hold on to your fixed frame of thinking , then it is like returning empty handed from a mountain of treasures .  
Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate . " But , that would probably be very hard , and I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to get a positive response from the farmers . "  
Different in thinking but not in status : Wildlife protection groups around the world today generally come in two kinds : One takes radical action to support the total prohibition of trade in endangered species ; the other believes that wildlife protection can not be accomplished in a single step and tries to study and gain an understanding of local conditions and works with local agencies or scholars in order to carry out long-term , systematic protection .  
Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide . He argues that in the two hundred years since the industrial revolution , the large-scale use of non-recyclable materials by mankind has allowed modern people to enjoy the same standard of living as an ancient emperor attended by 200 servants .  
A bird in the bush worth two in the hand : Hsu Cheng , director of the registration department at the National Palace Museum , says that flower and bird painting started growing from thinking about nature in the Tang dynasty , and after a rapid blossoming in the period of the Five Dynasties took to the path of realism , seeking to imitate nature in its mode of representation . With such realism requiring high artistic skills , perfect technique became the objective sought after by artists .  
Taoist doctrine was originally developed from the thinking of the Taoist masters . These masters actually preached passive inaction and following nature , but Taoist doctrine turned this basic naturalism into a different kind of reasoning which affirmed that various " natural " methods , such as alchemy and controlled breathing , could actually resist the limitations of nature and extend life without limitation .  
Fan Kang-lung , a young sculptor who has become well-known for carving eagles , says that humans always see eagles alone , never in groups . " Eagles are so often just a black speck high up in the sky , you can never get very close to them . They 're alone , distant and hazy , unwilling to be caught up in the troubles of everyday life , thinking that others can not understand their passionate , burning life . ' '  
At the end of the Ching dynasty , with the failure of the 100 Days Reform , the reformist royalist protectors Kang Yu-wei and Liang Chi-chao , both Cantonese , fled abroad . They published newspapers and established schools for the overseas Chinese in all kinds of places , stirring up patriotic thinking . It was only then that the Overseas Chinese began to identify with their country and became enthusiastic about politics .  
By the same token , those people who hope that the government can start political discussions on this subject with the Chinese Communists as soon as possible are apt to be accused of demeaning themselves and strengthening the enemy 's hand , while those who propose ignoring the Chinese Communists and appealing directly for international support are accused of wishful thinking and blindness to reality , or of opportunistically seeking Taiwanese independence . . . .  
Such is the case with Chinpao Shan 's Tsao Ji-chang , who makes his complex very clear . " Most mainlanders have a wily nature : great at talking , loving to argue but not liking hard work ; they are very suitable for thinking up ideas and moving their mouths , but their sincerity is limited . They often put profit before right , and let the boss lose out . "  
Recently , Hollywood 's studios made some adjustments to Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid When these fairy tales were produced for the big screen so that the films would better conform with current feminist thinking . In Beauty and the Beast , departing her former meek and submissive image , the character Beauty was depicted as an intelligent , independent , and headstrong woman who liked to read .  
One example can be found in the Taiwan television serial " Empress of an Age , " where aside from portraying the Empress Wu as a strong female in the traditional mold , the writers also see fit to credit her success to the support of two capable men . Not even a TV series which exalts the most legendary female figure in Chinese history can escape the confines of maleoriented thinking .  
Furthermore , in the spirit of " If I do n't enter hell , who will ? " he has courageously infiltrated the heart of the system . Perhaps on the surface it appears that he can gain status and honored treatment . But , on the outside , he must fend off vicious attacks from right and left , and , on the inside , must constantly be thinking about how to maintain his judgement and not become confused . This is certainly no easy process !  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
When they play matchmaker for unsuspecting foreign firms , they often introduce them to inefficient enterprises . In the end not only were mainland industries not saved from their doldrums , even the foreign businesses involved in cooperative investment were dragged down into the vortex , suffering greatly . Time to sink or swim " Now the way of thinking has changed , " Zhang Zhiqun explains .  
Just as Sun Ta-chuan , secretary-general of the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples ' Cultural Association has said , many Han Chinese have begun to realize that the everyday wisdom inherent in aboriginal culture includes important human factors which have long been lost from their own lives . Such " two-way " thinking is gradually growing into a sound and mutually adaptive interethni relationship .  
Those amazing Chinese parents " All things are beneath contempt , only education is to be esteemed . " " Only if you suffer can you surpass others . " The ancient sages have left many a pithy phrase to inspire us to greater heights . They articulate the line of thinking in Chinese culture which argues that learning is the only path to respectable success .  
Moreover , her articles were rigorously structured , with clearly presented lines of thinking for readers to follow . A second special feature is that she did not avoid expressing her positions on important issues facing the country and society . Her works were filled with support for " nativism " and " Taiwan first . " This set her apart from the introspective faction of writers who shied away from touching upon larger debates of collective interest .  
One scientific theory is that in this state the right hemisphere of the brain , which controls imagination , memory , creativity , and sensibility , is active , whereas the left hemisphere of the brain , which controls analytical thought , value judgments , and logical thinking , is suppressed . Someone who is hypnotized enters a trance-like state controlled by the right hemisphere .  
For example , to get his patients to release their emotions , he uses the Buddhist tantric " methods for seeing and thinking " as well as methods making use of modern physics that involve light , heat and magnetism . He teaches patients to use deep meditation to focus their energy on the part of the body that is uncomfortable in daily life . He also uses yoga to dispel accumulated depressed energy through relaxing the body .  
It 's no longer startling to see stories in the press of students and parents thinking that the behavior of such teachers is wrong , some teachers have even been physically attacked . Now we 're hearing calls to " maintain respect for teachers " even from university campuses , where the nation 's highest - ranking intellectuals are trained . This means that the traditional respect for teachers is being widely challenged all across contemporary society .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
Speaking of his 40-year quest to recreate the wooden ox , Wang Jian comments : " I have loved mechanical toys ever since I was a child . When I learned the story of the wooden ox I began making one out of cardboard and wood . I began drawing designs at middle school , and continued thinking on the subject at university , where I read mechanical engineering . My main sources were " Making the Wooden Ox " from Zhuge Liang 's Collected Works , and the documentary records of Zu Chongzhi . "  
The idea of " mindset " should not be limited to " positive thinking , " as emphasized by Haruyama . It also should include imagination , which can far transcend the practical realities of society . Thought patterns characterized by imagination are unrestrained by ordinary standards , and do not bow down to " reality . " This is a way of thinking that emphasizes the future and creativity .  
Haruyama 's philosophy in fact is simply a more rational form of a very popular current wave of thinking in Taiwan-the individualism of Taiwan 's so-called " new youth , " who refuse to get involved in the public sphere and who extol the idea that " as long as it makes me happy , there 's nothing wrong with it . "  
They had a low level of culture and knowledge , thinking only to gain the maximum they could in the minimum amount of time . In his book 100 Years Ago , the author John Warner writes that they were ' conservative , vulgar , lacking creative abilities in literature , science , or art . ' Members of the British middle class who failed at home , they came to Hong Kong determined to either get rich or go bust . "  
In traditional thinking , the bearing and raising of children is a woman 's natural occupation . Most mothers give their all in caring for their husbands and raising their children . Even women who are gradually moving out of the house and into the working world do everything they can to meet the demands of both house and job .  
This recognition returned me again to thinking about that tension experienced by the expatriate between the nagging desire to retreat back to one 's own country and the dogged intention to stay where one is . And it suggested some common ground between the fear and fascination I see written on the face of the two-year-old who comes upon me in the mall and my own fascination with the specter , every day repeated , on sidewalks all around me filled with " foreign " Asian faces .  
" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
In his thinking , the peasants have no month of rest and the life of the fields is one of exhausting hard labor . Yet he also saw the pleasure of rural life , when the peasants have finished work and " the children who were picking melons laugh and wash their feet at the water 's edge as the sun goes down , telling outrageous stories before the evening wind picks up . " This was a simple kind of leisure that the sophisticated literati were unable to appreciate .  
What university ? Beijing was the capital , and had a very conservative atmosphere . In the five-and-a-half years during which Tsai Yuan-pei was in charge of Beida , he changed it from a place reeking of bureaucratism to a center of lively , progressive thinking .  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
Of course , there is much in these " new age " books that looks ridiculous , that is mere wishful thinking , or that is just opinion . But they make apparent the great desire of human beings to seek truth , goodness , and knowledge . People have always been dissatisfied with , dubious about , or willing to challenge actual experience , and have sought a better world .  
" Having aboriginal peoples making their own videos involves the problem of interpretation , " says documentary maker Li Tao-ming . In the past , outsiders often arrived with preconceived dichotomies like " mainstream vs . non-mainstream , or privileged vs . disadvantaged . They saw themselves as being in charge of the documentary effort , of being at a higher level than the subjects . This type of thinking must be smashed .  
In 1997 , after the new curricula for elementary schools had been fully implemented , Chung Ching , an assistant professor of math education at National Taipei Teachers ' College wrote in a report he made on " The Transformation of the Culture of Math Class in the Lower Grades " that those students who have been educated under the new curricula are much more " able to voice their opinions , ask questions , work with others and learn from others ' way of thinking " than earlier students who had received traditional educations .  
He reminisces , thinking back to some of the measures that led to Taiwan 's current level of development . All of these policies , whether the all-out effort to develop the local IC industry , the establishment of the " one-stop shopping " science-based industrial parks , the importation of the concept of venture capitalism or the incentives to high-tech investment that the government provided , were hammered out in discussions between government strategists and Chinese who had studied and worked overseas .  
The simultaneous transfer of two high officials sparked a chain reaction of changes at the upper levels of the MOJ . The original cause was a political controversy sparked by an investigative report on allegations that Cheng had committed a sex crime . But the incident calls for broader thinking about issues that are becoming public as a result of democratization in Taiwan .  
Judging from the ROC national defense report , in which strategic thinking is guided by " no seeking of war but no fear of war , " it would have been be essential to respond flexibly ( i.e . at a parallel level ) to Communist China . Under such circumstances , there could have been rapid escalation to a military conflict .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
After the repeal of martial law , the provincial authority in charge of public security turned Green Island into a " reeducation center " for reforming criminals whose thinking needed changing or whose political views were problematic .  
" In traditional Chinese thinking there were human rights , there just was n't the term for them , " says Chai Sung-lin , chairman of the Chinese Human Rights Association . Apart from the support for human rights expressed in pre-Qin thought , when Liu Bang ruled at the end of the Qin , he and the elders mandated in law that those who killed would die themselves , and those who injured and robbed would be punished . " This provided a legal basis for protecting people 's rights to life and property . "  
For being and nonbeing give rise to each other , difficulty and ease complete each other , long and short reveal each other . . . . " This too displays Laozi 's characteristic way of thinking : everything in the manifest world comes in relative and complementary pairs , and human value judgements are mostly born of relativity .  
After years of research on " split-brain " epileptics ( epileptics whose corpus collosum-a neural structure linking the two sides of the brain-has been cut to limit seizures to one side of their brain ) , Sperry discovered that the left brain is responsible for language , logical thinking and analysis . The right brain , on the other hand , seems to be involved with images , imagination and intuition .  
In the 1980s , in a China undergoing reform and liberalization and stressing intellectual liberation and the May Fourth spirit of enlightenment , eminent mainland scholar Wang Yuanhua responded to an overseas scholars ' assertion that the radical thinking of May Fourth Movement figures was expressed in " all-round rejection of tradition " with the following words : " What the May Fourth Movement was up against was a feudalism which had been the ruling ideology for thousands of years . . . . Hence to rebel against it required a much greater effort . "
