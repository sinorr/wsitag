Social figures and mass media have questioned whether its deeds really suit its proclaimed nature and purpose when it registered the organization .  It is absolutely forbidden for any organization or individual to attempt to transform Hong Kong into a center for " Falungong " activities , to use Hong Kong as an anti-China base , to sabotage " one country , two systems , " or to sabotage Hong Kong 's social stability and prosperity .  Such attempts will be futile .

brought democracy into full play , kept to the mass line , and extensively solicited opinions before promulgating the drafts of important local laws and regulations .  Local people 's congresses with legislative power and their standing committees carried out anticipatory legislation in matters beyond the NPC and its standing committee 's exclusive legislative powers and where laws or administrative laws and regulations had yet to be drawn up , accumulating experience for the state to draw up corresponding laws .  
At the same time , the CPPCC must also strengthen ties with the party 's discipline inspection organs , state power organs , administrative supervisory organs , and judicial organs , cooperate with supervision by the media and other forms of mass supervision , and work in concert with all sides to promote the active , steady , sound , and effective progress of the CPPCC 's democratic supervision .  
Earlier , in 1995 , former US President Clinton announced that economic sanctions would be imposed against Iran , thereby restricting all trade and investment with companies in the US and abroad .  Iran 's supposed hampering of the Middle East peace process , support of international terrorism , and a probe into weapons of mass destruction were the pretext for the decision .  
Mr Ip said , " Hong Kong is ideally located to meet this objective , because of the critical mass already here , our strengths in shipping finance and P &amp; amp ; I Club , the cluster of local shipowners , and maritime administration based on the UK model , and more so , an extremely business friendly environment and Government , not to mention Hong Kong 's position as the gateway to Mainland China , one of the largest maritime countries in the world with considerable potential for expansion . " 
We have one of the best ports , airports and mass transit systems in the world .  We have some of the world 's most efficient and cost-effective communication systems and one of the highest concentration of mobile telephones .  We have invested one-fifth of our annual budget in education to ensure the supply of high quality manpower needed for our continuous economic growth .  We have a rich and diversified cultural heritage , a bilingual open society and a free port .  
At times when our Sun is active , tremendous explosions known as flares and coronal mass ejections can hurl billions of tonnes of matter into space in one stroke .  These cataclysmic events can trigger magnetic storms on Earth , resulting in poor radio communications or disrupted power grids .  Potential hazards to astronauts or satellites in space can be even more serious .  
The Report also states : " The people of Hong Kong continued to enjoy a tradition of free speech and free press . . .  A wide and diverse range of opinions , including those critical of the Hong Kong and PRC Governments , are routinely aired in the mass media and public fora . "

Having a critical mass of articulate and robust practitioners with good analytical ability and alive to both local and international developments would enable Hong Kong to capitalise on the opportunities offered by globalisation and to further our position as an international financial centre .  
" The new arrangement aims to attract Mainland students who had completed their bachelor degree or higher level studies in Hong Kong in 1990 or afterwards to re-enter here for employment .  The ultimate aim is to build up a critical mass of quality personnel so as to enhance the competitiveness of local companies in the knowledge-based global economy with a view to facilitating the economic development of Hong Kong , " she added .  
To ensure that there is no blockage of free flow of advanced technology for legitimate commercial and research use while at the same time to prevent Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , it is necessary for Hong Kong to maintain a comprehensive and stringent control over the import and export of strategic commodities .  
Mr Leung also pointed out that a critical mass of middle class consumers had been formed in the PRD as well as in the Yangtze River Delta and other coastal cities following a breakneck development in China .

In the rapidly changing industrial society of today , where values are constantly changing , youths are especially ready and willing to accept all kinds of fresh things and events . With the addition of the all-pervasive modern mass media , it is only natural that young people should have concepts and ways of doing things which are different from those of their elders in the preceding generation .  
According to Wang Ming-yang , a lecturer in industrial engineering at National Tsing Hua University , the problem lies in mass production . In a traditional society , where products were made by hand , clothing and everyday items could be custom designed to fit the individual .  
As soon as an unspoiled area with beautiful scenery is discovered , it is played up at once by the tourist industry and the mass media . Next , waves of visitors and vendors descend on it in droves . And with them come artificial walkways , concrete tables and chairs , paved roads , and parking lots .  
The technology involved in making optical fiber cables is rather developed and can be employed commercially on a mass production basis , but scientists are still hard at work day and night working to create a highly advanced technology for the future . (  
These included : The government should increase cultural and educational investment , establish a complete social welfare system and robust rule of law system , and strengthen public trust and public authority . The mass media should educate society and improve social habits , and should avoid exaggerating stories .  
A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
Its stumbling reform measures have given rise to such adverse side effects as graft , corruption , and soaring prices at the same time as they whetted the ardent hopes of the people for complete reform , resulting in the mass movements in Tienanmen Square . - - The bloody suppression in Tienanmen Square not only exposed the true nature of the Communists ' tyrannous regime , it also pointed up the internal contradictions among the political ruling class .  
A plan for the long-term development of Taiwan 's infrastructure has been outlined as follows : To solve the problem of the over-concentration of population in the cities , a mass rapid-transit system has been drawn up for six major urban zones : Taipei , Taoyuan , Hsinchu , Taichung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung . The heart of each city serves as the focal center for a complex trans-portation network which will embrace all the suburban and outlying areas surrounding the city .  
In the past few years , because of other major infrastructure projects like the mass transit system , the second northern express , and the inland line , because many corporations had bought up the factory land early on for low prices , overnight the value of their assets became many times the capital investment .  
For example , Tang dynasty IOUs , contracts and accounts of interest rates provided economic historians with important evidence . All kinds of censuses , land records and documents of civic associations brought to light the pattern of land transfers and civil activities . Yet the mass of Buddhist sutras and ancient literature was even more important for instilling new life into literary , historical and philosophical research . Tunhuang studies had begun .  
No clear plan was set out for upgrading Taichung to a metropolis , nor for opening Taichung Harbor to direct cross-strait shipping ; the high-speed railway was diverted to a coastal route via new towns far from Taichung city ; the third international airport was planned for southern Taiwan ; no increases in numbers of universities and colleges were envisaged under the plan ; and the mass transit system urgently needed to solve Taichung 's transportation problems would n't be ready until the year 2020 ! "  
It was not long before they came to accept this as natural - - if you wanted to get ahead then you had to actively take part in the League , national mass study organizations and social work . Moreover , there could be no questioning of communist thinking ; otherwise one would be seen as a rebel and expelled from the League , making further study impossible .  
When the 27,000 residents of Shuili Rural Township heard that the Chichi line would be dismantled as soon as their fleet new highway was finished , they launched a mass petition drive and formed the Chichi Line Preservation Committee , pooling local tourist resources and holding special activities to attract outside visitors .  
Altogether , there are probably no more than ten similar local drama troupes . Participants mostly have a sense that cultural development between the cities and the rural areas is too imbalanced : In Taipei arts groups are concentrated together and there are abundant performing arts . But elsewhere , after the powerful assault of the mass media , now everyone is bolted in front of the TV watching the same old TV personalities and plots that have nothing to do with their daily lives . Where have those dramas that reflect local life gone to ? "  
Usually found in the temperate zone , most of them were brought from abroad by migratory birds like the quillwort and the Sparganium fallax . Their taking root in the subtropical environment of Taiwan has greatly startled international botanists . Among them are plants found at their southern most geographical limit : The Nuphar shimadai is especially noteworthy because it belongs to temperate zone family of water plants found mostly in North America and the northern parts of the Eurasian land mass .  
Despite having been established for only a short time , in the last two " preparatory " years the bicycle R &amp; D center has already come up with sixteen applications for special patents to provide to manufacturers for mass production . Moreover , an even more important breakthrough has been creation of equipment for precise measuring of the mutual tolerance of the bicycle frame and the other parts ( in the past they could only make rough guesses ) , which saves the enterprises the trouble of muddling through for themselves .  
Liu Yu-shan , secretory-general of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , notes that right now the projects in which the Europeans , Americans , and Japanese are most interested are the high-tech ones . The main ones can be categorized as transportation ( the mass rapid transit system and the high-speed railroad ) , energy ( the fourth nuclear power and electrical generators ) , environmental protection ( incinerators ) , and the modernization of the postal and telecommunications networks .  
Researchers have endeavored to find the reasons why grey mullet production has been unstable in recent years . One important discovery is that although the cold water mass from the mainland heads south to Taiwan , if it is n't sustained , which is to say if it does n't come far enough south , then it wo n't be strong enough to get into that push-pull dynamic with the Kuroshio Current , so that the fish will not form into schools . "  
Because the ozone layer can absorb ultraviolet light from sunlight and block out most of the radiation harmful to life on earth , as the protective function of this layer is weakened , the incidence of diseases related to unltraviolet rays , such as skin cancer or cataracts , rises dramatically ; the immune systems of animals become repressed ; plant growth stagnates ; and it even leads to a drop in agricultural production and mass deaths in aquatic life .  
The faces of Buddhist Statues are mass produced in plastic ; the frames for final resting places are carved by machines and are ragged ; and course paper is used for the ceremonial spirit house , " says Master Hsu , angry about the superficiality of the living . As for whether the place where the deceased reside in the afterlife will leak water or collapse , that is of course part of the gap between this and the other world , and there is nothing anyone can do about it .  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers . Even for those left behind , traditional Hakka values are fading in young people because of increased education , the impact of the mass media , and multifarious interactions with other ethnic groups .  
Before the 1970s , ceramic art in Taiwan could only truly be considered a ceramics industry , and was still developing in terms of mass production . Not only was the pottery glazed with few colors , the rate of failure was high , and progress in design was halted at the stage of fake antique flower vases or exported decorative ceramic dolls .  
A dialogue between modernism and nativismLooking from the perspective of musical history , local Taiwanese music with its mass support and elitist experimental modern music must extend upwards or downwards respectively , into the third level of the musical pyramid , before they can intermingle to produce a " local music " which is capable of really expressing the feelings and aspirations of Taiwan 's people , but which can also be played on an international stage and be shared with other nations .  
If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious . The mass media is continually emphasizing that good academic work is not enough , and that a complete education should give equal emphasis to ethics , physical education , group consciousness , and fine arts as well . Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
It took only half the anticipated amount of time to get from initial design to mass production , greatly increasing efficiency . When this plane came onto the market , many people remained skeptical , and there was quite a controversy when some defects came to light after formal flying had begun . However , it turned out that the cause was a loose door , and there was no threat to flight safety .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits . Thus , if VR core technology and peripheral equipment can be developed in time , not only will this spur industrial upgrading in Taiwan , it can reduce current high production costs through mass production .  
But because traffic is a more thorny problem in that part of the city , the site currently most favored by the city government is in the vicinity of the Sungshan tobacco factory in Nankang , a suburban area of northeast Taipei . This is further from the city center , a highway already goes by there , and a mass transit system station will soon be completed there . The city government argues that these will be of some help in moving large numbers of people .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
Lien Te-sen became famous for his work " MRT , " in which he rendered the character xing ( �� ) , meaning " motion , " in several disconnected pieces , and in the center drew the character gui ( �t ) , meaning " turtle , " in ancient seal script , thus mocking the progress of Taipei 's traffic and mass rapid transit system .  
Given that everyone is exposed to the mass media today , it is hard to ensure that the views and statements that senior citizens express about the past have not been guided by the current context . " It is very possible that , given a certain atmosphere in society , the interviewee knows very well what the interviewer is aiming at , and just tells him or her what they want to hear , " cautions Wang Ming-ko , an associate researcher at the Institute of History and Philology at the Academia Sinica .  
This summer , in the wake of Typhoon Herb , which brought 30-year record rainfall , the water level in both reservoirs rose past the warning mark , and both had to discharge excess water . Ten days later , when Taipei County councillors flew by helicopter to inspect water resource areas , the surface of the Shihmen Reservoir was a seething mass of brown water . But by stark contrast , the waters of the Feitsui Reservoir were clear and green .  
Many people , regardless of how they feel about classical music , recognize that raising the " quality " of the nation is something that begins within people themselves . We must now simply wait to see what sort of reactions will be stirred by this encounter between the mass medium of radio , and the refined realm of classical music .  
Currently , the problem is that " there are no rules of the game . Just looking at circulation tricks to expand or maintain sales , apart from giving discounts , giving papers away for free is also common , " suggests mass communications scholar Hsu Chia-shih . There is no mutual trust in the newspaper industry , and there is no objective standard to determine " number of newspapers sold . " That is why they are so chilly toward the ABC .  
Leaving aside the earliest relations between man and elephant , it was beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries , when Europeans first penetrated the continent , that the African elephant began to face mass slaughter . After three centuries of killing , the elephant population was devastated . In Capetown , South Africa , for example , when the government established the national park in 1931 , there were only 11 elephants , compared to the historical peak when at least 100,000 elephants roamed the grassy plain .  
However , many artists are unwilling to let this 800-year-old Chinese folk tradition wither and die . In 1985 the Council for Cultural Planning and Development began an annual competition to select the best New Year 's prints . Each year many creative submissions combining tradition and contemporary styles are received , reflecting today 's actual mass culture .  
For the mass of ordinary people , who are impatient and full of worldly desires , the idea of heaven as an essentially illusory mental state achieved by self-cultivation is abstruse and complex , and the continuous , unrelenting effort required to enter such a state is both hard to understand and hard to achieve . Thus it is understandable that a " heaven " in which religious concepts are simplified and popularized is preferred by proselytizers .  
People have long been aware of the educational and recreational functions of museums . But now the global trend is toward moving the focus of museums away from the elite to the general public , and relating them more closely to the lives of the people who live nearby . From elite to mass  
Having realized the meaning of " through learning you increase [ the mass of your knowledge ] day by day ; but by following the Way you diminish [ your sophistry ] day by day , " Ma Shu-li tells his students that today , with everything oriented towards technical development , understanding of life and the mind and soul has not advanced commensurately , so that when faced with social issues most people do not know how to approach them intellectually .  
ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry . It is a constant motivating force for democratic political development . In the future , the ROC will continue to practically implement and fully realize such essential components of civilization as democracy , freedom and human rights , striving in concert with others to achieve the goal of global press freedom .  
Looking at the larger environment , in recent years , the global financial crisis and cross-strait tensions have caused economic turbulence , and firms have closed factories and laid off personnel . The situation has been especially serious in the mass media . In all areas of media , including TV , radio , newspapers , and magazines , the market is saturated , and few people are leaving their jobs .  
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high-speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport . There will now be a legal basis for the high-speed railway to raise more capital . Also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the Chang Yi financial group can become reality .  
Taking as a precedent his approach to the Mass Rapid Transit System when he was mayor of Taipei , Chen says that during the mayoral elections he opposed the embryonic mass transit system , but he did not tear it down just to fulfill a campaign promise . Instead , he organized a group of experts from Taiwan and overseas to investigate the system , and , he says , resolved the problems by improving the MRTS .  
This cultural illness is particularly serious in United States . American girls begin to be extremely concerned about their appearance from high school on , and many people are constantly depressed about their weight . Though the situation is not so serious in Taiwan , the mass media puts out a virtually unvarying message that beauty equals success . It is difficult for young people to resist the message implied in teenage beauty pageants , love-at-first-sight stories pairing up beautiful girls and handsome guys , and the images of pop superstars .  
Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality . Living on borrowed time and borrowed culture , caught between the ersatz pleasures of the West and the call of historical destiny . . . . "  
Fish noodles are a special type of noodle particular to China 's southeast coastal region . They are made from four parts cornstarch and six parts eel , drum , and other high-grade fish . The mass is then rolled , pressed , cut , and dried in the sun .  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
Take Citicorp , for example . Although it has a good image , offers comprehensive financial services , and is creative with its management methods , it has been frustrated to find that its business has remained limited to foreign firms and members of the economic elite . It has continued to be unsuccessful in entering the mass market .  
Among other things , the draft Political Party Law stipulates that in the future all political parties will be prohibited from operating or investing in profit-making enterprises or non-print mass media , and they must periodically report their financial holdings .

The incident was sparked when police stopped a pair of students from NTU and Taipei Teachers ' College for riding double on a bicycle . When the students proved uncooperative , the police beat and detained them , setting off a chain of events that eventually led to mass arrests by the military police .  
True , these books may sell far less than the dazzling numbers pulled in by the best-sellers , but look at it another way . In terms of the total amount published , this steady , solid flow of books coming in from the mainland is already making serious incursions into the literary mass market .  
Thereafter , activists were absorbed into the mainstream political forces , and on both the political stage and in the business community they have played increasingly important roles . In these roles they have been given mixed reviews , being seen as " bold and idealistic " but also as naive " Boy Scouts . " The sixth and seventh generations-those aged 18-30 or so today , and thus the core group of interest to us here-are those of the age of mass university attendance .  
Intending to prevent a recurrence of Bunun resistance and because it was difficult to keep the garrison roads in good repair in the deep mountain areas , the Japanese government went a step further and forced a mass displacement of the Bunun down the mountain to the lower reaches of the Lakulaku River on the Huatung Valley plain . Through contact with the Han Chinese and the Amis people living there , the unique characteristics of Bunun mountain culture were gradually lost .  
Due to Taiwan 's unique geographical position and diverse alpine terrain , as well as the numerous avenues for the immigration of new species-including transport by ocean currents , settlement by migratory birds , the mass migration of species during the ice age when Taiwan and the Chinese mainland were connected-the high level of biodiversity on the island greatly exceeds that of any other place on Earth .  
He explained that the meeting of transient cold weather and warm and damp air mass , which is comparatively active this winter , has brought about the two snowfalls , which are bound to bring down the temperature in the Beijing area  
In flagrant defiance of international humanitarian law , crimes such as " ethnic cleansing " , mass rapes , torture and deliberate bombing of civilian targets continue to be committed against the innocent Bosnian people .  
Because of the physical nature of such material , the uncontrolled movement of nuclear material , in conjunction with the interests of organized crime , creates favourable conditions for the production of the socalled personal weapons of mass destruction .  
A Member of the United Nations family has fallen victim to a blatant and cruel war of conquest , accompanied by genocide , rape , religious " cleansing " and mass expulsions , the consequence of which is a horrible new kind of Serboapartheid .  
Deeply preoccupied by the increasingly heavy burden being imposed , particularly upon developing countries with limited resources of their own and upon the international community as a whole , by these sudden mass exoduses and displacements of population ,  
If the existence of the numerous mass graves situated at or near identified detention facilities were to be confirmed , such confirmation would be relevant to the inquiry into " ethnic cleansing " ( see paras .  129150 ) .  
The changed pattern of adult morbidity is reflected in the increased number of patients suffering from noncontagious mass chronic diseases but also in the renewed incidence of contagious diseases .  
Second , there is the question as to how specific intent to commit an act of genocide ( where an accused is alleged to have killed a single human being ) is to be distinguished from an act of ordinary murder or the killing of several from mass murder . 
For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds , the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including , where applicable , the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights . "  
It follows that the existence of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights in a country does not as such constitute a sufficient ground for determining that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture upon his return to that country ; additional grounds must exist that indicate that the individual concerned would be personally at risk .  
We are confident that a Middle East zone free of nuclear and weapons of mass destruction would enhance the peace process and lead to a situation wherein enormous financial resources would be saved and channelled towards the economic prosperity and social development of the peoples of the region .  
Our people find it astonishing that in an era of such developed mass communication , which leaves no distance between different corners of the globe , the apparently insurmountable difficulties in particular , the actual causes of the continuing imposed war are not understood .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
Globalization , an all-inclusive term conceived in the interests of the major transnational corporations , is now devouring national entities , sovereignty and independence beyond any limit or reason , bringing in its wake a global invasion of destitution , population growth , mass migration and environmental degradation , which can not be avoided by even the most powerful of this world .  
The arrogant approach and attitude of the Government of the United States of America towards the international community , and the unsuccessful attempts of the American foreign policy establishment to exploit issues of global concern , such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , to advance an extraneous and illegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed dangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral measures .  
Another main reason for this failure is that the policies of major arms-producing countries designed to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons are always short-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at securing the destructive power of their own weaponry and their own military dominance .  
These obligations include achieving complete nuclear disarmament , expanding the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , strengthening the role and enhancing the authority of the IAEA as the only international body competent to oversee the good-faith discharge of Member States ' responsibilities under the Treaty , ensuring the universality of the NPT as an urgent priority , and establishing the Middle East as a zone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
It is hard , however , to speak about either a successful and broad application of the educational potential of sport or sporting achievements in a country where the mass aspect of sport one of its fundamental principles has been violated as a result of aggression by the neighbouring Republic of Armenia .  
My Government also considers that all the steps and measures taken by the Israeli occupation authorities with the aim of altering the legal status and demographic character of the Palestinian and Arab occupied territories , particularly with regard to Al-Quds , are null and void and constitute a serious breach of international law .  Peace , security , stability and development in the Middle East require the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the region , including nuclear weapons .  
However , severe problems of unemployment , poverty and income distribution have grown worse in many places , contributing to political instability , mass migration , environmental stress , and ethnic conflict .  
Besides the fact that it continues to be the most universal and fundamental instrument for the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons , its extension demonstrated the international community 's common desire to reject all weapons of mass destruction .  
Surely it is more than mere symbolism that the very first resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its first session , on 24 January 1946 , was devoted to limiting the use of atomic energy to peaceful purposes , and to eliminating from national arsenals atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction .  
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
In short , the practical achievement of that purpose in the present international context entails preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , further strengthening existing conventions in this field , pursuing the process of nuclear disarmament , limiting and reducing existing conventional arsenals and establishing confidence - and security-building measures .  
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
There is no doubt that the international agreements and instruments that have been concluded to date and have become an integral part of international law have had a far-reaching effect in limiting the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction and have been instrumental in shaping international expectations in this area .  
Calls upon all States in the Middle East to take practical steps in appropriate forums aimed at making progress towards , inter alia , the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear , chemical and biological , and their delivery systems , and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective .  
In conclusion , Nigeria would like to see the First Committee at this historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly motivated by the desire for cooperation in finding genuine and lasting solutions to those problems that continue to confront us in the area of disarmament in the remaining part of this twentieth century , in order to bequeath to the next generation in the twenty-first century a world which is indeed free of these weapons of mass destruction . 
Secondly , the elimination of nuclear weapons , whether immediate or gradual , would certainly lead to the attainment of a world free of nuclear weapons and eventually of all weapons of mass destruction and would facilitate complete and general disarmament which , in turn , would ease tensions in the world at large and help redirect financial and other resources to economic and social development .  
Despite the achievements of the first half of the Decade in reducing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and also in limiting conventional weapons , the road towards the noble objective of the Third Disarmament Decade remains a long and winding one .  
In this so-called new era in which bipolar confrontation no longer exists , it is especially regrettable that the international community should be unable to arrive at a firm commitment on nuclear disarmament and on the complete elimination of these weapons of mass destruction , which continue to endanger the very survival of the human race .  
Serious violations of human rights and the mass exodus of a considerable portion of the Haitian population for political or economic reasons called for prompt and resolute action on the part of the international community , the United Nations and the Organization of American States .  
In general , it was noted that the main factors constraining the development of sustainable national capacities include ( a ) the absence of an enabling public sector environment ; ( b ) the lack of a critical mass of suitably trained and motivated counterparts ; ( c ) high turnover ; and ( d ) the non-fulfilment of national budgetary and in-kind commitments .  
There was a need to continue the search for more effective measures to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of which posed a threat to peace and international security , especially given the growing number of regional and internal conflicts .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
Supported by a relatively strong foundation in science and technology and a critical mass of skilled human resources in the field of biological sciences , many countries , especially those in Central and Eastern Europe , can , with appropriate and timely support from the international community , move forward rapidly in biotechnology development and its safe applications .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
The most drastic examples of abuse of the members of the Albanian national minority are placing of children in the front rows of separatist demonstrations , spreading rumour about alleged mass poisoning of Albanian children and the forcibly preventing the young generation from acquiring compulsory elementary education and other levels of education in their mother tongue for which Serbia and Yugoslavia have provided all necessary material , financial and personnel conditions .  
The investigation of the complaint would require questioning suspects , victims and witnesses , collecting documentary and other forensic evidence , ensuring that appropriate chains of custody of evidence are maintained , conducting searches , conducting mass grave exhumations where necessary , undertaking local inquiries and coordinating with various national authorities and other investigation agencies .  
It is estimated that an amount of $ 100,000 would be required for human rights education and public information in Guatemala to educate and keep the public civic organizations and the mass media , both national and international , informed of the Mission 's activities and findings .  
Further areas of concern related to biological weapons , new types of weapons of mass destruction , radiological weapons , limitation and reduction of conventional weapons and international arms transfers , the prevention of an arms race in outer space , curbing the naval arms race , naval armaments and disarmament , and reduction of military budgets .  
Systematic violation of human rights and freedoms : mass arrests , abductions and murders , pent-up political trials , forcible mobilizations , evictions and ethnic cleansing , plunder , disrespect of religious freedoms , not acknowledging of national and religious institutions of the Bosniac-Moslems .  
Despite an almost total information blockade and the restriction of the movement of representatives of international organizations by the Croatian side under various pretexts , foreign media have managed to inform the world public about some of the atrocities and the systematic drive of the Croatian military and civilian authorities to erase the traces of these atrocities by burning the dead , burying them in unmarked mass graves or by washing the streets and roads to remove the evidence .  
These included : empowerment of women as an overall concept ; mass media ; statistics and indicators on gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development : water , waste management and sanitation ; renewable energy ; and issues related to different groups of female population such as the ageing , displaced ; refugees and migrants .  50 .  The Board decided that INSTRAW should introduce the following in its new programme , among other subjects :  
In many developing countries there is an apparent lack of a " critical mass " of qualified managers , technicians , and skilled workers needed to support basic levels of public sector activity .  
It is India 's considered view that before the Security Council embarks on any action to formally give itself a " role in the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction " , all substantive , legal and institutional issues , including the role of specific treaty bodies , must be addressed and resolved through an open and transparent debate among the full membership of the United Nations .  
A regional project in southern Africa is providing training to managers and field workers in interpersonal communication skills and the use of low-cost audiovisual materials .  Rural radio remains the most effective mass medium to reach large numbers of rural audiences and FAO is continuing its efforts to strengthen rural radio services , especially in Africa .  
Weak economic and accounting data systems , poor tender procedures , secrecy of budget documents and deficient mass media were identified as the main explanatory factors .  
By the horrifying indiscriminate mass artillery and missile bombardment of predominantly civilian targets in all the towns of Serb Krajina , Croatia unambiguously demonstrated that one of its main goals , apart from imposing its sovereignty over Krajina , was to inflict heavy losses on the civilian population and by so doing incite a mass exodus of Serbs in order to create an ethnically pure Croat state .  
While the number of those killed , beaten , detained and sexually assaulted remains unknown , consistent accounts by displaced persons and United Nations personnel lead to a strong presumption that Bosnian Serb soldiers committed substantial violations of international humanitarian law following the fall of Srebrenica , including mass arbitrary detention of civilian men and boys , and summary executions .  
The question must be raised : what possible moral authority do NATO and the United Nations have to pursue a relentless campaign of mass bombardment of the Republic of Srpska , causing unprecedented material damage and numerous civilian casualties ?  
Massive violations of human rights , especially in the form of genocide , " ethnic cleansing " as a strategy of war and its consequences , rape , including systematic rape of women in war situations , creating mass exodus of refugees and displaced persons , are abhorrent practices that are strongly condemned and must be immediately stopped , while perpetrators of such crimes must be punished .  
The mass media must also be mobilized with the support of non-governmental organizations , at the level of both States and regional organizations , in order to ensure the periodic dissemination of human rights information .  In addition , greater efforts must be made by the mass media to avoid propagating racist prejudice and stereotypes and to help the general public to form responsible critical opinions on the increasingly tragic events which tend to be trivialized in some circles .  
For this purpose , the central bank should promote the establishment , on a volunteer basis , of a critical mass of primary dealers who must satisfy certain minimum criteria ( such as observing minimum capital standards ) to possess the financial capacity to support the government securities market , and encourage competition .  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
His delegation was therefore pleased that the Commission had decided to refer to the Drafting Committee only the articles concerned with aggression , genocide , systematic or mass violations of human rights , and exceptionally serious war crimes ; that decision demonstrated that the Commission was directing its work towards a realistic , rather than a political concept of crimes against the peace and security of mankind .  
If the level of women 's representation of between 30 and 35 per cent and above is considered to form a critical mass , the Secretariat can be considered to have achieved that status in such occupational groups as political affairs , legal affairs , public information , administration , social affairs , economic affairs , human resources and human rights .  
The Croatian aggression resulted in major and forcible demographic displacement in the areas under the protection of the United Nations forces , i.e . , in mass resettlement and exodus of the Serbian population , violation of human rights , burning and destruction of their property including the Orthodox places of worship and Serbian cultural and historical monuments .  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
Teams of experts provided by the Netherlands , Norway , Spain , Switzerland and the United States of America undertook special investigations into acts of genocide , including a comprehensive survey by forensic experts of massacre and mass grave sites , interviews of surviving victims and witnesses , and the collection and preservation of documentary and other tangible evidence .  
Along with the rest of the international community , her Government had been appalled by the callous treatment of vulnerable groups in that area and continued to be concerned about the fate of missing persons within the territory of the former Yugoslavia and the indications that mass executions might have taken place .  
Thanks to free enterprise , a number of popular daily and weekly newspapers enjoyed mass circulation and dozens of private radio stations and some independent television companies were now in operation .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
In India , programmes to guarantee employment to the rural poor and unemployed youth , meet the nutritional , educational and health needs of women and promote their empowerment , and mass literacy programmes were central to the realization of situation-specific strategies .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
In view of the obvious link between human rights violations , the mass displacement of persons and the emergence of threats to international peace and security , Russia agreed with UNHCR that human rights monitoring must be one of the preventive measures included in plans for United Nations peace-keeping activities and in negotiations on peaceful settlement of disputes , and that safeguarding human rights was closely linked to the protection of refugees .

gravely concerned at reports , including by the Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
Democracy , sustainable development , social justice , environmental protection and the promotion of global peace and security were goals which could not be achieved unless disputes were settled by peaceful means and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was stopped .  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
this regard , we have read with grave concern the latest report of the Secretary-General , further confirming earlier reports that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most , all in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
adds a dramatic picture of new , appalling violations of humanitarian law that have taken place more recently in the Banja Luka region : a large-scale resumption of ethnic cleansing ; new cases of persons unaccounted for ; and chilling evidence , discovered in Sanski Most , of mass executions .  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
Supreme Council discussed Iraq 's implementation of Security Council resolutions relating to its aggression against Kuwait and expressed its deep concern that the Iraqi Government was continuing to fail to implement in full some fundamental aspects of its international obligations under those resolutions and its dubious conduct with regard to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , which constituted a violation of the terms of the cease-fire laid down in resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant United Nations resolutions .  
The destruction , massacres and immeasurable suffering in Lebanon reported by the mass media , which show human bodies that have been cut up and mutilated , is unequivocal proof of the barbaric nature of the aggression taking place at the hands of the Israelis .  
Other pressing issues include the population explosion , environmental degradation , the water shortage , desertification , the food deficit , the growing gap between the North and the South , the regional arms race , the threat posed by nuclear weapons , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , development concerns , barriers to economic and trade cooperation , the removal of restrictions on free trade and , last but not least , human rights .  
Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities of stemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction , bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building capabilities , advancing sustainable economic and social development , and reinforcing our joint commitment to international law and human rights ? 
The increased number and growing sophistication of lethal nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons of mass destruction and the further development of their intercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat of annihilation for many countries and peoples , especially when some of the countries which possess them lack even minimal credibility .  
While actively supporting the Commission , the Sultanate of Oman would point out that such efforts alone can not guarantee equitable security in the region if they are not paired with other effective and practical measures to eliminate weapons of mass destruction there and to promote comprehensive and unconditional acceptance of international monitoring and inspection of all activities related to this matter .  
At a time when most third-world countries are facing enormous challenges that hamper their advance towards greater progress and prosperity , and while our planet is facing environmental challenges that threaten the future of all life on Earth , considerable resources are being devoted to the production , refinement and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction of all kinds , while official development assistance continues to decline .  
Firmly and consistently committed to the course of democratic development pursued by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan , Mr . Emomali Rakhmonov , the Government of my country promotes the involvement of the broad mass of the population in social , political and economic reform processes through such mechanisms as referendums , national elections to representative bodies , renovation of the judicial system and every possible encouragement of openness .  
We believe that , with the treaties and bilateral agreements concluded , and the ongoing negotiations among the nuclear-weapon States , and also with the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year , the international community is now reaffirming its commitment to global disarmament and renewing the hopes for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
In spite of obstructions and misinformation campaigns , the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to articulate and pursue initiatives and measures aimed at fostering greater regional confidence ; enhancing respect for principles of international law ; bringing about transparency in armaments and reduction of military spending ; creating zones free from weapons of mass destruction ; strengthening peace and security through persistent endeavours to encourage and facilitate understanding and conciliation ; and consolidating economic cooperation .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
The ideal way of achieving this objective is not by applying arbitrary measures in the form of cutbacks , mass dismissals or redeployment , but by applying the guidelines of the General Assembly on personnel issues consistently , while observing and bolstering the principle that the Secretariat must be accountable in a strict and transparent fashion for the execution of the mandates entrusted to it by the Organization 's only universal organ that is , the General Assembly .  
Given the progress made to date , we can not forget that we must move towards prohibiting and completely eliminating this kind of weapon , because of its mass , indiscriminate and devastating effects , its long-term threat , its tragic human consequences and its widespread hindrance of the productive use of broad areas , particularly affecting those most in need and seriously jeopardizing the living conditions of many peoples .  
The systematic efforts to annihilate 20-million Iraqis were contrary to all international instruments , which must lead the international community to consider economic sanctions as an internationally prohibited weapon of mass destruction , since the application of sanctions against Iraq had caused significantly more victims than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima , which was ironic in the extreme given the degree of interest currently evinced in human rights . 
The Final Declaration of the summit of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , meeting in Cartagena last year , expressed the Movement 's support for the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament as being an opportunity to review , from a perspective more in tune with the current international situation , the most critical aspects of disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in favour of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and of the control and reduction of conventional weapons .  
He deplored the continuing flagrant mass violations of human rights taking place throughout the world , and concluded that the protection and promotion of human rights was a long and exacting task which required the undivided attention and vigilance of all members of the international community , from United Nations bodies and national Governments to non-governmental organizations and individuals .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
Politicians must be involved in its formulation ; politically compelling arguments for forest conservation and sustainable forestry development must be found ; and a critical mass of well-informed and motivated key decision makers committed to the plan or programme must be created .  
Genocide , aggression , systematic or mass violations of human rights , exceptionally serious war crimes , international terrorism and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs were covered in the draft ; those crimes represented the most serious breaches of the peace and security of mankind .  
Experience has served to design a comprehensive project for the dissemination of and education in human and indigenous rights , through integrated mass public information campaigns that use media and messages tailored to the population 's socio-economic and cultural context and give particular importance to the multi-ethnic nature of Guatemala .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and the university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Also gravely concerned at reports , including by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
In this context , we hope that Iraq will create the conditions and climate necessary for achieving this objective , through full cooperation with the Special Commission established to supervise the elimination of all Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , and through the provision , at the earliest possible date , of complete , comprehensive and final information on all elements of its proscribed programmes .  
The technical and professional posts remaining in the Department for Development Support and Management Services were to constitute the minimal critical mass needed to provide substantive support to overall planning and management activities in mineral resources in line with the mandate of the Department .  
In addition , the documents were prepared on the following subjects : protection aspects of UNHCR activities on behalf of internally displaced persons ; comprehensive and regional approaches to refugee problems ; recommendations of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) / UNHCR Symposium on Refugees and forced Population Displacements in Africa ; and the scope of international protection in mass influx ; as well as a note on current UNHCR activities on behalf of stateless persons .  
A mass of detailed research in recent years has revealed a rich fabric of support networks and mutual or community-based initiatives to deal with everyday problems of economic survival and social functioning .  
To promote awareness in Africa and in the international community of the nature of the critical economic and social situation in Africa , and of the domestic and international efforts required for recovery and development , through wide dissemination of the periodical African Recovery to the general public and to target groups such as parliamentarians , non-governmental organizations , trade unions and academic institutions , as well as through outreach to the African and international mass media ;  
In this connection , the Council pledges its continued political and material support for the efforts of the United Nations Special Commission entrusted with the elimination of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction and invites the international community to participate actively in supporting the Commission 's efforts in every way possible in order to enable it to achieve its objective of placing the security and stability of the region on a firm foundation .  
The limits to be defined in the submission from a coastal State with a continental shelf that extends beyond 200 nautical miles are to be based on distances measured with respect to " the foot of the continental slope " near the edge of the submerged prolongation of its land mass .  
The sediment thickness rule provides States the opportunity to optimize the extent of the outer continental shelf boundary and is intended to define the effective seaward limit of the sedimentary wedge derived from the land mass .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
Improvements over the existing systems include higher spatial and spectral resolutions in both the visible and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum , more frequent imaging , air mass analysis and more timely data dissemination .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
In addition , comprehensive media support , based on permanent cooperation with the mass media ( national radio and television services , regional radio services , press ) has been developed and gradually strengthened by :  
Israel 's refusal to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , when it possesses enormous numbers of nuclear weapons , is developing other weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery and refuses to place its facilities under international supervision and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards , not only flouts the wishes of the international community but also constitutes a grave and persistent threat to the security and the future of the peoples of the region and , consequently , to international peace and security .  
The Plan of Action has five objectives : the assessment of needs and formulation of strategies ; building and strengthening human rights education programmes at the international , regional , national and local levels ; developing and coordinating the development of human rights education materials ; strengthening the role of the mass media ; and promoting the global dissemination of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development , whose establishment had been one of the most important results of the Rio Conference , played a vital role in mobilizing a political commitment to safeguard the environment and was promoting sustainable consumption patterns , a particularly relevant issue in view of the threat to the environment posed by the culture of mass consumption fostered by the market mechanisms that were being introduced into the developing world .  
Concerning the use of national human resources , he said that the national staff of UNDP were among its most valuable resources ; in many of the field offices , the only international staff members were the resident representatives and their deputies , while all the others were nationals , who were generally experienced in the work of UNDP programmes and projects , familiar with the culture and language , and frequently had worked for the Government , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the mass media . 
In recent years , owing to fragmentation of States into newly independent countries , the twin problems of forced relocation of populations and mass expulsions , including the so-called " ethnic cleansing " operations , have resulted in the involuntary displacement of millions of people as well as considerable suffering and loss of life and property .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
The limited mass , volume , stability and optics of microsatellites could not compete with traditional large-scale missions such as the Land Remote Sensing Satellite ( LANDSAT ) , Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) and the European remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) ; however , for medium resolution and meteorological-scale imaging , the KITSAT and POSAT satellites had demonstrated a comparable facility but at a tiny fraction of the cost .  
Being aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Thus , the main lesson learned to date indicates that , while promoting new small enterprises may have helped to create a thriving SME sector , it has not so far created a sufficient mass of vigorous and innovative medium-sized enterprises capable of becoming a driving force for a healthy market economy .  
A five-year plan had been prepared for the Afro-Colombian population to give impetus to the organization of their communities , through the strengthening of advisory committees at the departmental , regional and district levels and the undertaking of research projects , and particularly one aimed at compiling basic statistical data on that population group and another aimed at preparing a map of socio-cultural zones and regions with majority black populations .  The five-year plan also provided for dissemination activities in coordination with the mass media .  
It laid down guidelines for concerted action by Governments and the United Nations system to take effective measures to eliminate contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination and encouraged the mass media to promote ideas of tolerance and understanding .

Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Appropriate institutions of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , workers ' and employers ' organizations , labour unions , the mass media , religious organizations , community organizations , the family , independent information , resource and training centres and others , for the purpose of incorporating human rights education into non-formal programmes , should be encouraged and assisted in developing and delivering such non-formal programmes , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes .  
Accordingly , in light of the international strategic importance of the Gulf region , the Council renewed its call to the international community and the relevant international organizations to make active efforts to transform that region into a zone free of weapons of mass destruction .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
A culture of peace will contribute to international cooperation for economic and social development and sustained economic growth in the developing countries of our world and permit the billions of dollars spent each year on armaments of death and mass destruction to be directed towards eradicating poverty , facilitating human development and making our world a better place to live in for all , developed and developing countries alike .  
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .  
We are concerned at the constant threat to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States coming from Afghanistan ; the flow of narcotics and contraband weapons ; reports that reach us about gross violations of humanitarian law by the warring factions , including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war ; the blockade by the Taliban of the central regions of Afghanistan populated by the Hazara people , and the continuing large-scale violations of human rights , particularly the rights of women and children .  
As we can see , these hidden weapons of mass destruction continue to cause irreversible damage in Central America , even though the Esquipulas process to achieve final peace in the region has already achieved its objective , putting an end to the armed conflict in Guatemala , and even though it is now seven and five years , respectively , since the civil wars ended in Nicaragua and El Salvador . The cruelty of these weapons is overwhelming . 
We therefore appeal from this rostrum for merging our efforts at the Government and organizational level , both inter-State and voluntary , to galvanize our will and generate our energies , both official and at the mass level , in order to provide material and technical resources to implement practical and well-considered programmes to achieve this end .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
The non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction requires of the international community a comprehensive approach that will take into account the horizontal , vertical and qualitative aspects of non-proliferation as well as the exchange , for peaceful purposes , of technology , information , equipment and materials related to those weapons , including the establishment of control mechanisms for possible dual usage .  
The disarmament and international security agenda for the future can be comprehensively addressed with regard to both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons through the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
In considering the allocation of resources to disarmament , the United Nations should not only take into account the priority which this necessitates and the high emphasis given to it by the entire international community ; it should also be focused on the work that is already being done and still needs to be done by the international community on the future agenda to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction and to halt the proliferation of conventional weapons beyond the legitimate requirements of self-defence .  
The highest priority for the international community , therefore , should continue to remain the ultimate and complete elimination of nuclear weapons as was laid down in the Final Document of SSOD I . The agenda should also include measures on the elimination of the other weapons of mass destruction , in particular chemical and biological weapons , through the full implementation of relevant disarmament treaties . 
While urbanization and economic growth are linked and are regarded as dominant features of national economic development , rapid urbanization will pose enormous challenges for the urban social and physical environment , particularly in terms of the widespread poverty that results from mass unemployment .  
While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
At the same time the Commission further defined the mandate of the expert by requesting him to coordinate his efforts with other international actors in the field , to prepare a comprehensive plan concerning the excavation of mass graves and the exhumation of mortal remains , and to assume responsibility for securing appropriate support , including financial assistance , for these tasks .  
PHR is a Boston-based non _ governmental organization of forensic anthropologists , archaeologists , pathologists and other health professionals that seeks to use medical and scientific knowledge to protect human rights and promote accountability for violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular by investigating mass graves to identify victims of extrajudicial executions .  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
UNTAES is requested to continue its support in this respect .  In particular , all suspected mass grave sites need to be guarded and demined , and the forensic experts need to be provided with full personal security and protection while exhuming mortal remains in the field .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines including engineers .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
This should include appropriate delegation of authority , enhancement of the capacity of the staff through training and the provision of a stable resource base to ensure the continuous presence of an institutional critical mass .  A first step in that direction would be for Headquarters to provide urgent assistance by assigning to Nairobi for one month a senior administrator with proven experience in the establishment and functioning of United Nations common services outputs ( SP-96-001-19 ) .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Recognizing that the missing are - with very few , if any , exceptions - deceased , the local authorities , my Office and other members of the international community have focused efforts on the exhumation of mass graves and the clearing of unburied mortal remains .  
Recognizes that institutions responsible for sustaining the rule of law play an important role in removing the causes of mass exoduses and , in this context , calls on the High Commissioner to continue his efforts , at the request of the Governments concerned , to reinforce national legal , judicial and administrative capacity , including training opportunities through technical cooperation programmes in countries of origin as well as host countries , particularly developing countries ;  
Recognizes that the causes of mass exoduses are often of a structural nature and are directly linked to the prevailing unjust and inequitable international political and economic order , and notes in this regard that the study of purely national aspects alone will not reveal the real roots of the problem ;  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
The international community of States ( the United Nations , OSCE , CIS and the European Parliament ) , in condemning the policy of " ethnic cleansing " in the form of mass extermination and forcible expulsion of the predominantly Georgian population of Abkhazia , has affirmed the unacceptability of refusing to allow them to return to Abkhazia and of forcibly changing the demographic composition of Abkhazia , Georgia . 
The telephone numbers and addresses of those responsible shall be provided to the population through the mass media to be used by citizens in critical situations ; on receiving the signal , those responsible must arrive at the place of the incident accompanied by an expert doctor , a lawyer and the persons involved .  
While there are many similarities between the practice of forced evictions and internal displacement , population transfer , mass expulsions , mass exodus , ethnic cleansing and other practices involving the coerced and involuntary movement of people from their homes , lands and communities , forced evictions constitute a distinct practice under international law .  
Urges all States to be guided in their national policies by the need to curb the testing , the production and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering ;  
Decides to authorize Ms . Ferero Ucros to prepare , without financial implications , a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering .  
A reign of terror has been let loose , characterized by extrajudicial executions , indiscriminate killings , random and mass arrests for political reasons , forced relocation of the population , gang rapes of women and systematic efforts to obliterate the ethnic , social and cultural identity of the Kashmiri people .  
It seems to us that the CD , with its accumulated experience of complex disarmament negotiations on weapons of mass destruction , is the ideal forum in which to carry forward discussions on the technical and legal questions which must be confronted if we are to achieve the elimination of nuclear weapons .  
It was regrettable that racial hatred , intolerance , ethnic persecution and unchecked political ambitions were continuing to cause conflicts leading to such mass movements .  
The replaced Taliban forces north of Kabul , however , are being brought daily to Kunduz civilian airport for further acts of genocide in northern Afghanistan , of which the ethnically oriented carnage and the burial in a mass grave on 14 September 1997 of more than 100 civilians in the village of Qizil-Abad , in northern Balkh province , as reported by the Reuters correspondent Alistair Lyon , is a testimony . 
These measures are intrinsically linked to the just and lasting resolution of conflicts , the peaceful settlement of disputes , concrete and effective measures of disarmament through the accession of all the States of the region to the multinational agreements on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction ( the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Chemical Weapons Convention , the Biological Weapons Convention , etc . ) , and to the placement of all nuclear installations under international control .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
The gap in socio-economic development between the countries of the south and north of the region is widening , there remains in the area a critical mass of combustible material the Middle East conflict and the as yet unsettled Cyprus problem , and there is a high level of saturation with weapons , accompanied by the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
The main objectives of the Institute are : to raise public awareness for human rights ; to further educate civil servants , teachers , lawyers on human rights ; to strengthen human rights education in the Cyprus educational system at all levels ; to strengthen the capacity of the mass media for human rights education by appropriate means ; to promote the active engagement of national non-governmental organizations in the realization of the goals of the Decade ; and to establish a human rights library in order to enhance public awareness .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and longer lasting , combining inter-State and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions and , in some cases , natural disasters .  
One of the key provisions in this context is article 17 , under which States parties recognize the important function performed by the mass media and shall ensure that the child has access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources , especially those aimed at the promotion of his or her social , spiritual and moral well-being and physical and mental health .  
It is therefore our common task and responsibility to seize this historic opportunity , provided by the present international environment , to work together for the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and for the regulation and control of other conventional tools of killing .  
The study might also include ( a ) knowledge about human rights among the general population , as well as potential target groups ; ( b ) social , political and economic conditions relevant to human rights education ; ( c ) human rights educational access for marginalized groups ; and ( d ) treatment of human rights issues by the mass media ( including television , radio , newspapers and popular magazines ) .  
At its fiftieth session , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 182 of 22 December 1995 , entitled Human rights and mass exoduses , in which it , inter alia , acknowledged that mass exoduses of populations were caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation .  
United Nations treaty bodies , special rapporteurs , representatives and independent experts have regularly provided valuable information on specific human rights problems having the potential of generating mass exoduses or preventing their resolution , together with recommendations for corrective measures .  
An effective human rights regime , secured by institutions that support the rule of law , including an independent judicial system accessible to all and an accountable public administration , is also of paramount importance for the creation of a stable society and thus conducive to consolidating peace and preventing the recurrence of mass exodus .  
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
While these developments are not in themselves sufficient to dispel our anxieties about the safety of our planet from the threat of weapons of mass destruction , we should seize the moment and take concrete steps to consolidate the limited gains that have been realized , and move to resolve the outstanding disagreements which have stalled initiatives to find lasting solutions to fundamental disarmament issues .  
One of the main tasks of the conference could be to draw up , in cooperation with other interested international organizations , a United Nations strategy for the regulation of migratory flows and the prevention of mass forced population displacement at the global level .  
As Member States will recall , this paper became a basis for General Assembly resolution 48 / 87 , by which the Assembly , among other things , further adopted a thematic approach to cluster items into 10 broad topics : nuclear weapons ; other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; confidence-building measures , including transparency in armaments ; outer space disarmament aspects ; disarmament machinery ; other disarmament measures ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Other national legislation relevant to the regime governing the right to freedom of opinion and expression includes article 7 of the Civil Code concerning defamation , providing that upon decision of a court , the mass medium concerned and the officials or citizens responsible shall make compensation in the degree set by the court for moral ( non-property ) injury caused to a citizen as a result of the dissemination by the mass media of inaccurate information damaging to his honour , dignity or business reputation .  
We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
Our commitment to the setting up of such a court stems from the fact that this court would be a landmark development in the creation of a balanced and effective system aimed at ensuring that international crimes , especially mass violations of basic fundamental human rights , do not remain unpunished .  
The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination . 
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .  
It was a positive contribution by the Court to the realization of the goal of total elimination of nuclear weapons , which must be pursued by the international community if we are to eliminate the possibility of this planet , and all the people on it , being annihilated by these horrendous weapons of mass destruction .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
In addition to these illegal Israeli settlement activities , numerous reports and documents of the United Nations provide ample description of the systematic inhumane practices of the Zionist regime , including arbitrary mass arrests , detention and shooting of Palestinians , sealing or demolition of homes and internal closure of the territories .  
In its resolution 1996 / 51 , the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ third session an update of the report of the Secretary-General on human rights and mass exoduses ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 42 ) , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to that resolution , as well as all relevant information on the human rights situations creating or affecting refugees and displaced persons .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled " Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights " , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
The Government considered that the use of force , foreign occupation or domination , and unilateral economic coercion or international sanctions to resolve conflicts , halt violations of human rights and promote democracy , were factors in creating refugees and mass exoduses .  
Furthermore , it was noted that unbalanced international political relations were often an important factor in the occurrence of mass exoduses through the threat to use force or interference in a country 's internal affairs , as was happening in the case of Iraq , where direct or indirect interference by the United States of America and some of its allies was creating tension , encouraging some of the population to leave , particularly for neighbouring countries .  
While several Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in their replies emphasized the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to the problems of mass exoduses , as well as the need to pay special attention to the continuum of emergency to development assistance , others provided information on more specific programmes or on current developments in their respective countries .  
The Note outlined several elements indispensable in protection-based comprehensive approaches to avoiding mass displacement , such as upholding the international rule of law , including relevant human rights and refugee law principles , which should be seen as positive and enabling components of any comprehensive approach .  
The United Nations Department for Public Information ( DPI ) highlighted the important role of public information in raising awareness of the question of human rights and mass exodus , highlighting activities such as the production of print material , films , radio and television programmes and radio documentaries , as well as collaborating with NGOs and coordinating inter-agency promotional activities .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
The Government of Ukraine pointed out that it considered it vital to expand the efforts for preventive measures with a view to identifying and forestalling the main causes of mass exoduses and the emergence of new refugee and migrant populations , including the establishment of efficient rapid response and early _ warning mechanisms to deal with crisis situations .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , HCHR / CHR has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .  
The major activities included the completion of a full environmental test campaign ( thermal vacuum , vibration , RF , and mass properties measurements ) on the Canadian MSAT M1 satellite ( successfully launched on 20 April 1996 ) , and the initiation of environmental testing on the various components ( motor modules , joints , latching end effectors , and the mobile base system ) for Canada 's contribution to the international Space Station Project , the Mobile Servicing System .  
The first was the signing at Cairo of the African Nuclear _ Weapon _ Free Zone Treaty as a testimony to the developing countries ' commitment to the cause of nuclear disarmament worldwide and also as a positive and encouraging step which should be followed soon by the negotiation of the establishment of another zone in the Middle East in conformity with the relevant United Nations General Assembly resolutions and as a step towards the implementation of President Mubarak 's proposal concerning the establishment of a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .  
Pursuant to my letter to you dated 19 January 1997 concerning the forcible transfer and deportation of the civilian population of the districts north of Kabul ( S / 1997 / 54 , annex ) , I inform you with deep sorrow that the inhuman practice of mass deportation of ethnic Tajik residing in the districts north of Kabul is being continued by the Taliban mercenaries .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
My Government is fully confident that , provided there is political will , tangible action addressing conventional weapons would not be beyond the scope either of the ability or the competence of a forum that has to its credit the successful negotiation of bans on whole categories of weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons .  
Van der Stoel 's allegations concerning mass arrests in northern Iraq are pure fabrications , since everyone is aware of that region 's special status and the consequences of the abnormal situation in which it finds itself , being outside the scope of the State administration due to foreign military intervention and the establishment of air exclusion zones .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
The country does not have the technical , physical or human resources to manufacture weapons of mass destruction , since its principal concern is to promote its economic development plan and to mitigate the adverse impact that the coercive measures imposed on our people have had on all aspects of life .  
I am convinced that integrating support for policy formulation , analytical and normative functions and relevant technical cooperation activities will serve to reinforce the necessary critical mass available at Headquarters for this indispensable aspect of the work of the Organization and the overall effectiveness of the Secretariat .  
He was convinced that integrating substantive support for policy formulation , analytical and normative functions , and relevant technical cooperation activities would serve to reinforce the necessary critical mass available at Headquarters for that indispensable aspect of the Organization 's work and the overall effectiveness of the Secretariat .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
The approach represents the satellite as a combination of individual elements and positions these to provide maximum protection to the satellite components .  [ 29 ] The PLATFORM model uses a novel element termed SHIELD [ 30 ] which uses genetic algorithms to determine the optimal configuration of a spacecraft based on the encountered environment and design constraints such as thermal and mass balancing .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
The Ministerial Council reaffirmed its absolute and unwavering belief in Iraq 's obligation to comply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular those pertaining to the release of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and detainees ; cooperate fully with the Special Commission in its investigation of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction ; return all public and private property to Kuwait ; continue to comply fully with the compensation mechanism ; and refrain from all hostile or provocative acts directed against Kuwait and neighbouring States , pursuant to resolution 949 ( 1994 ) .  
For sustained economic growth and sustainable development , a critical mass is necessary not only in physical infrastructure but also in an educated and skilled workforce .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
Decides to authorize the inclusion of this question in the preliminary document concerning a study in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , to be submitted to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The Middle East region represents a case in point , where the qualitative imbalance in terms of armaments is so striking and where transparency and confidence can only come about if approached in a balanced and comprehensive way .  Applying transparency in the Middle East region to seven categories of conventional weapons , while ignoring more advanced , more sophisticated or more lethal armaments , such as weapons of mass destruction , is an approach that is neither balanced nor comprehensive .  
Side by side with measures to introduce new information technologies , for example using the Internet and CD-ROMs to offer comprehensive information about the United Nations and its work to a wider audience , it was essential to continue supporting and using various traditional mass media such as printed matter , radio and television , bearing in mind the diversity and different level of development of countries around the world .  
Scientific , technical and cultural progress and the information revolution of the past decade had made the mass media an important instrument and a true reflection of current international realities in places , especially in developing countries , undergoing civil wars and conflicts .  
The threats posed by weapons of mass destruction are far from being extinguished , and the consequences of miscalculation or deliberate acts can be horrific , as we know from the terrorist activities of a cult group armed with nerve gas in Japan , biological and toxin weapons in Iraq and persistent reports and risks of nuclear smuggling .  
In subsequent statements , particularly , those entitled " political development policies " of the executive branches , emphasis was again placed on respecting human dignity and integrity ; ensuring civil rights and freedom ; defending public trials and the right to a lawyer ; fostering an independent mass media ; and fostering the principles of pluralism and diversity .  
They facilitate the spread of an economic model based on the principles of a market economy , while mass advertising and the global media help shape human aspirations and perceptions of social values .  
Furthermore , UNHCR emphasized that an essential condition for the prevention of involuntary mass movements is adequate political will on the part of the States directly concerned , and by the international community as a whole .  
Looking back at its record over the last 30 years , the Conference has developed an impressive set of international legal instruments that addresses in a comprehensive manner the security challenges posed by weapons of mass destruction .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
The challenge now is to combine this complex policy and organizational mix at the local , national and international levels into a critical mass that can lead to significant changes in human behaviour .  
The evaluations show that a major factor for achieving positive results is the availability of a critical mass of financial resources in order for the national programmes that the United Nations system is supporting to be effective .  
Threats to international peace and security have been posed not only by weapons of mass destruction but also by the excessive build-up of conventional weapons beyond a level considered legitimate for the purpose of self-defence .  
The reported mass killing of civilians by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds has continued since 8 August 1998 and has now found a serious and tragic dimension in Bamyan , a city largely populated by Shiite Muslims .  
The reported mass killing of civilians by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds has continued since 8 August 1998 and has now found a serious and tragic dimension in Bamyan , a city largely populated by Shiite Muslims .  
One of the key factors driving this dramatic growth in electronic commerce among the industrialized economies has been the achievement of a critical mass of online users .  
While welcoming also the notable progress made on instruments regarding weapons of mass destruction , Mali is deeply concerned about conventional weapons , which remain an area so far unexplored and not subject to international norms .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
While welcoming the Departments efforts and noting its enormous advances in the electronic information field , his delegation believed it necessary to point out that , because of the manifold economic and financial problems faced by countries with economies in transition , the traditional mass media were still the principal sources of information there .  
Strongly condemns summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings , enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , and calls upon the Government of Iraq to provide an accounting for the clean-out of prisons where there is credible evidence of mass summary executions ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial and arbitrary executions , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , forced relocation and denial of freedom of expression , assembly , association and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
By the Governments decision , the National Council for Womens Affairs , headed by a Cabinet member , the Minister for Health and Social Welfare , was established at the end of 1996 , and its operational by-laws were accordingly adopted . the Council is made up of MPs , officials of ministries concerned , representatives of womens non-governmental organizations , voluntary movements , mass organizations , owners of private companies , business and cooperative entities . 
In view of the fact that the two types of weapons of mass destruction of biological and chemical weapons have been comprehensively prohibited , there is no reason why nuclear weapons , which are of greater destructive force , should not be comprehensively banned and thoroughly destroyed .  
The programme budget for the biennium 19961997 , as approved by the General Assembly , stated that the efforts of the international community were still focused on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear ones , but were becoming increasingly concerned with the growth and proliferation of various types of conventional weapons ( A / 50 / 6 / Rev . 1,3 para .  2.81 ) .  The programme budget for the biennium 19981999 maintains the same approach .  
They pointed specifically to additional tasks and duties in the area of practical disarmament in the conventional field , the implementation of arms agreements regarding weapons of mass destruction , the facilitating of regional agreements and confidence-building measures and the current and future tasks associated with the implementation of international agreements on anti-personnel landmines ( A / 52 / 282 , para .  4 ) .  
Demands an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities which has led to further ethnic cleansing in the region , the genocide of Kosovars , their forced mass exodus and the destruction of their property with the aim of preventing their return , and also demands the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo ;  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
An important and recent concern has been the impact of transnational informational technology and mass media on peoples perceptions and expectations , in terms of their leading to or aggravating a conflict between expectations and realities , and between values and social roles , induced by the contrast between the cultures of rich countries and the pattern of opportunity in less well off societies .  
The Russian Federation and the Republic of Tajikistan shall contribute in every way possible to the preservation of the spiritual and cultural affinities of the two countries , deepen mutual ties in the fields of culture , science , public health services , education and information , promote the establishment of direct ties between organizations and people active in the areas of culture and art , and between research centres , educational institutions and the mass media .  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
They are guaranteed the right to establish and use their own mass media , cultural , educational , language and religious institutions , and to establish and foster unhindered relations and maintain peaceful contacts with co-nationals outside the Yugoslav borders , as well as the right to participate at the national , regional and local levels .  
Gravely concerned by such recent outrages as the murder of three human rights defenders and mass abduction from an aircraft , for which guerrilla groups were responsible , it calls on the guerrilla groups to respect norms of international humanitarian law , especially to refrain from killings and all attacks on the civilian population , indiscriminate massacres , hostage _ taking and the widespread use of anti _ personnel landmines , and to fulfil their own pledges not to recruit children .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .

The readiness demonstrated by the Arab States to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free from all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective in accordance with paragraph 5 of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East as well as paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) should not go unnoticed .  
In its resolution 1997 / 36 , of 28 August 1997 , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities authorized Ms . Clemencia Forero Ucros to prepare a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , for submission to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
The crisis in Kosovo has resulted in the mass forced displacement and deportation of hundreds of thousands of civilians , wholesale destruction of property and means of livelihood , wanton lawlessness and violence , thousands of documented killings , countless as-yet undocumented deaths , and immeasurable human suffering .  
Following the end of cold war , the United Nations has been called upon to take up new challenges and tasks as a result of the growing threat from the existence of large stockpiles of nuclear weapons , proposals for ballistic missile defences and the weaponization of outer space , the lack of progress in the field of disarmament , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the development and use of advanced and sophisticated conventional arms ;  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
It further asserts that it is mindful of the harmful environmental impact of weapons of mass destruction and that it has constantly urged that the environment should be protected , that it should not be damaged and that its effective contribution to the achievement of sustainable development should not be impaired .  
In fact , GPS services are expected to complete the transition from a stand-alone device system to a standard feature integrated into a variety of multifunctional products such as wireless personal communication devices , leading to a drastic reduction in prices . mass consumer market with an average selling price per receiving unit of about $ 100 . 264 bis . 
Ensure that United Nations missions aimed at peace-making , peacekeeping and peace-building include a mass media component that can disseminate information about international humanitarian law and human rights law , including peace education and children 's protection , while also giving objective information about the activities of the United Nations , and encourage authorized regional missions to include such a capacity .  
Recognizing that , owing to exceptional circumstances , Iraq was the subject of a unique sanctions regime established under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the Board nevertheless stressed the importance of ridding Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction ; of Iraqs full compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions ; and the grave regional and international consequences of Iraqs persistent non-compliance .  
The European Union has expressed support for the creation of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East , and emphasized the importance of additional protocols to safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency as an effective measure to prevent nuclear proliferation and foster mutual confidence .  
If not , the Security Council will impress upon the world public that the United States Government has abused the United Nations name to protect KLA terrorists , to cover up mass human rights violations and make possible the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and Metohija , thus creating a state which is both illegal and untenable .  
We can not but sound the alarm regarding information on new gross violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including reports of mass shootings , arrests and forcible relocations of hundreds of thousands of peaceful inhabitants of Afghanistan .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
She also condemned the grave human rights violations suffered by Serbs , Roma and others , expressing deep concern over the mass exodus of 150,000 Serbs from Kosovo , who join more than half a-million Serb refugees in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina enduring deprivation and an uncertain future in Serbia .  
The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) acts with its partners in the international community to assist in meeting the operational challenges of migration , advance understanding of migration issues , encourage social and economic development through migration , and uphold the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  IOM is involved in all phases of mass exoduses , providing technical and operational expertise in such areas as transportation , health , and other services for migrants .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
We know what these causes of conflict are : the huge gap between the living standards and incomes of different classes and nations ; the exponential increase in mass migration from poor to rich countries ; cultural difference and the conflicts and fanaticism it triggers ; criminal acts for the sake of glorifying or even creating a nation .  
So it is that the objective of collective security of States , associated with the new horizons opened up at the end of the cold war and serious progress towards general and complete disarmament which should involve first and foremost weapons of mass destruction will be expressed in the new terms of physical well-being and quality of life for citizens .  
Questions have arisen as to whether such exclusive arrangements with limited membership have been truly effective in achieving their stated purpose of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime , especially with regard to scientific and technological applications connected with advanced weapons as well as weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,

Any consideration of the Iraq sanctions regime should not be artificially forced or hurried if we are to achieve the twin goals of alleviating the grave humanitarian situation in Iraq and ensuring Iraqi compliance with the requirements in respect of its alleged remaining weapons of mass destruction .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for those laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
However , to these categories there ought to be added a fourth : man-conceived disasters , including genocide , mass deportations , the use of death camps , ethnic cleansing , enforced or involuntary disappearances and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
At the 8 th meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee , the representative of the Russian Federation stated that the growing ability of terrorist groups to acquire sophisticated technologies and weapons of mass destruction made international terrorism a most serious problem calling for effective and concerted action by the international community .  
Meanwhile , short - and medium-term measures include confidence-building at the regional and global levels , transparency in the field of armaments , a steady reduction of military expenditures , the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the interim .  
We see , on the one hand , astounding developments in many fields of human endeavour and , on the other , national and international conflicts , resulting in mass destruction of human life and infrastructure as well as the almost irreversible compromising of the ecological system .  
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
At the same time , it is astonishing that a regime that has a dark record of developing , producing and stockpiling many inhumane kinds of weapons of mass destruction ventures to accuse a country that is among those in the Middle East that have joined the most basic international instruments in effect in the field of disarmament .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .

Of course , they would love to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction , stockpiles of fissile material and above all , many fewer conventional weapons , to enable them to live a peaceful life.Are we anywhere near these objectives and aspirations ?  
While obviously limited in payload mass , volume and power , but with very real and attractive advantages in terms of cost and response time , microsatellites complemented traditional large satellites by providing an alternative gap-filler for affordable quick-response or exploratory missions with both civil and military objectives .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
The experience is that these soft forms of tourism can be just as destructive as mass tourism , if they are not planned , developed and managed in a sustainable manner , so as to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the natural environment or the local sociocultural fabric , and that the local community is involved in all development and management phases .  
In resolution 34-175 , entitled Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
Yet practical results have been dismal as regard substantive measures directed toward the eventual and total elimination of nuclear weapons , which constitute the most destructive of such weapons of mass destruction .  
Taking into account the progress already made in international and subregional cooperation and coordination to make the most effective use of existing facilities , it should be noted that the major constraints for small island developing States are not so much the lack of scientific knowledge and technology as the shortage of financial and human resources more specifically , the lack of a critical mass of qualified scientists and associated institutions .  
If we truly want the Conference on Disarmament to live up to its responsibilities as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament and international security , let us focus our work here on halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons.Let us start today the negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty !  
Egypt regrets that all the efforts made to expand the scope of the United Nations Register have not yet yielded the required results since the Register remains limited to the annual notification of transfers of seven categories of conventional arms and continues to disregard other sophisticated and lethal types of conventional arms as well as weapons of mass destruction and advanced technologies with military applications .  
While respecting Algerias stages of political , economic , sociological and cultural development and acknowledging that popular support is necessary for any reform relating to womens rights , the Committee encourages the Government , non-governmental organizations , intellectuals and the mass media to do everything possible by means of publicity and public awareness campaigns to encourage more enlightened attitudes and accelerate womens emancipation .  
In order to foster coordination between the State and civil society , numerous mass events focusing on the issue of womens political and social participation and involving over 22 , 000 women ( parliaments , town meetings and social dialogues ) were held between 1995 and 1998 . These gave rise to permanent forums such as the womens regional round tables .  
Scientific and technological breakthroughs , growing interdependence , impressive development of standards of behaviour at the international level , and the emergence of a global consensus to prevent war and curb the perils of armaments and , particularly , weapons of mass destruction are indeed significant achievements of the twentieth century .  
It is no longer acceptable or even practical to divide the international community into two distinct groupings : one living behind the walls of fortresses of alliances and weapons of mass destruction , while the security concerns of others are completely neglected as they are depicted as the source of possible threat and worthy of containment and deprivation . 
Any integral pallet base forming part of a large packaging or any detachable pallet shall be suitable for mechanical handling with the large packaging filled to its maximum permissible gross mass .  
Any integral pallet base forming part of a large packaging or any detachable pallet shall be suitable for mechanical handling with the large packaging filled to its maximum permissible gross mass .  
Lithium content means the mass of lithium in the anode of a lithium metal or lithium alloy cell , which for a primary cell is measured when the cell is in an undischarged state and for a rechargeable cell is measured when the cell is fully charged , except that in the case of a lithium-ion cell the lithium content is measured in terms of equivalent lithium content , which in grams is calculated to be 0.3 times the rated capacity in ampere-hours .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for these laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo , affecting ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo personnel and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
The two sides consider that the creation , in violation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 , of a national anti-ballistic-missile defence system by one of the States which signed that Treaty will have a destructive effect on strategic stability and on the entire structure of key international agreements relating to disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery , and will mar prospects for achieving further progress in these directions .  
In the broad spectrum of other challenges , such as global epidemics , regional conflicts , nationalist hatred , religious violence and terrorism , one of the very real dangers to human survival still emanates from the existence of weapons of mass destruction .  
In the Declaration , we also expressed our intention to carry out all the efforts required to ensure the Treatys full and universal implementation in order to promote the final objective , a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
This is a mass organization , whose main functions are to help take care of the material and spiritual life of older persons and to engage them in the political , social and cultural activities of the local community .  
The independent expert reported to the Commission at its previous session on the preliminary assessment by a team of forensic experts sent by OHCHR of mass graves in the vicinity of Hargeisa , in northwest Somalia ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 103 / Add . 1 ) .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
While weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons , continue to be of primary concern , the international community has expressed increasing concern about the proliferation of conventional weapons , especially small arms and light weapons .  
It is generally recognized that the modern world is still characterized by the persistence of armed conflicts , which continue to cause human losses and mass violations of human rights , as well as economic , social and cultural devastation .  
Our national and regional security is best enhanced through the development of an international security system and through the removal of the threat to peace posed by weapons of mass destruction and the excessive accumulation of conventional weapons .  
Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .  
The consequences of war , acts of genocide , armed conflicts , family violence , international terrorism , organized crime , and trafficking in humans and drugs , as well as weapons of mass destruction and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , have devastating consequences for children and a profound impact on their lives and their communities .  
The Declaration emphasizes the important role of international cooperation for , and the valuable work of individuals , groups and associations in contributing to , the effective elimination of all violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of peoples and individuals , including in relation to mass , flagrant or systematic violations of human rights .  
Governments , relevant United Nations agencies , Bretton Woods institutions and civil society organizations ( including unions , the private sector , mass media and universities ) should all be actively involved in identifying the most effective ways to achieve sustainable social outcomes for children .  
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .  
The reply describes emergency humanitarian assistance for the displaced population ; direct emergency humanitarian assistance for cases of mass displacement ; non-food aid for mass displacements ; individual and family humanitarian assistance ; and a scheme of independently-managed humanitarian assistance which is not confined to emergency humanitarian support but involves major investments to help restore the social and economic stability of the displaced population .  
The Ministerial Council welcomed the historic outcome of the referendum on the Charter of National Action in Bahrain , which expressed national cohesion as well as popular support for and mass approval of all the worthy measures and policies of His Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa , Amir of Bahrain , thus bolstering the process of modernization and development and the building of a bright future for the State of Bahrain and the advancement of its citizens .  
Mr . President , I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Egypts total commitment to work earnestly and diligently towards the achievement of the objectives of general and complete disarmament , which require maintenance of the minimum defence requirements and the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , in accordance with the priorities adopted by the international community at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
Urge the United Nations , other appropriate international and regional organizations and States to redress the marginalization of Africas contribution to world history and civilization by developing and implementing a specific and comprehensive programme of research , education and mass communication to widely disseminate the truth about Africas seminal and valuable contribution to humanity ;  
The parliamentarians of the Republic of Belarus appeal to State parliaments and Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , business , financial , scientific and religious circles , social movements and funds , representatives of the mass media , their compatriots and all peoples of goodwill not to forget that the people of Belarus have been living in an environmental disaster area for many decades and need active assistance from the world community . 
The international community , during the course of last year and still in the year 2001 , witnessed how the Pakistan military junta played host to public mass gatherings of terrorist networks of the region and the extremist religious groups of Pakistan on its soil , who clearly and explicitly proclaimed their agenda and expressed intentions for expanding their realm of influence in the region through setting up extremist and radical regimes in countries of the region .  
Its main purpose is to move ahead and explore other priority areas touched upon in the earlier documents prepared by the Special Rapporteur , namely the problem of definition and of the actors involved in the exercise or use of terrorist activity , the development of new forms of terrorism and the probability of mass destruction terrorism and , finally , a number of issues associated with the consequences of terrorism for human rights .  
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
We firmly believe that the Final Document of the General Assemblys special session devoted to disarmament in 1978 rightly stated that the main priority should be granted to nuclear disarmament and weapons of mass destruction , and , afterward , conventional weapons .  
While warm thanks were due to the Government of Germany for its growing understanding of the needs of the UNFCCC secretariat and to the City of Bonn for its unfailing hospitality , he believed that the over-all United Nations presence in Bonn had not yet reached the critical mass of activity that would provide an attractive base for career development and allow United Nations institutions to recruit , motivate and retain competent staff .  
Where gaps or deficiencies are identified or confirmed during the exercise , UNDP will seek answers to the question of how to establish new practices that will serve to establish the critical mass of information required for future reports and to carry out a rigorous , comprehensive evaluative assessment of UNDP performance .  
Applying transparency in the Middle East region to seven categories of conventional weapons while ignoring more advanced , more sophisticated or more lethal armaments , such as weapons of mass destruction and , in particular , nuclear weapons , is an approach that is neither balanced nor comprehensive .  
At its fifty-seventh session , in April 2001 , the Commission on Human Rights adopted , without a vote , resolution 2001 / 13 on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan , in which it strongly condemned the mass killings and systematic human rights violations against civilians and persons deprived of their liberty , for reasons related to the armed conflict , resulting in the massive , forced displacement of the civilian population .  
Everyone is aware of the critical role of the mass media in shaping public opinion on any question , be it domestic or international , and of its major responsibility to observe impartiality and complete objectivity in covering events such as those that took place in the United States recently .  
Therefore , besides the legal instruments prohibiting weapons of mass destruction , it is vitally important today for the international community to promote closer cooperation to upgrade the physical protection of nuclear material , combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and enhance the protection and control of nuclear facilities against acts of terrorism and sabotage .  
Although weapons of mass destruction are the most threatening of weapons to our societies , in circumstances of civil war and armed conflicts small arms and light weapons have proved to be equally deadly and brutal .  
In the new millennium , other priorities include eliminating the so-called tactical nuclear weapons ; banning fissile materials for weapons purposes ; arresting the acquisition of advanced weapons of mass destruction ; maintaining the credibility of the non-proliferation regime ; and concluding an international convention against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear-weapon States .  
For more than 50 years now , we have struggled to find ways to achieve that measure of global political coherence required to survive the grave risks posed by weapons of mass destruction , thermonuclear bombs foremost among them , whose blasts are thousands of times more powerful than those of 11 September arsenals that could lead to human extinction .  
In the view of my Government , it is especially necessary to undertake effective and substantial multilateral efforts , to consolidate existing instruments against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to set up universally verifiable and transparent arms control and disarmament regimes . 
Moreover , the international community must take action to bolster existing mechanisms and instruments and to set out a specific timetable for the successive stages of general disarmament and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction nuclear , chemical and biological in particular .  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
The United Arab Emirates , which joined the NPT , the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) and the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) , in order to reinforce its international position , believes that establishing zones free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is the key to establishing balances in international and regional strategic relations .  
It further urged the United Nations to redress the marginalization of Africas contribution to world history and civilization by developing and implementing a specific and comprehensive programme of research , education and mass communication to disseminate widely a balanced and objective presentation of Africas seminal and valuable contribution to humanity .  
Notwithstanding the fresh hopes for a safer environment brought about by the end of the cold war , the world has experienced a proliferation of regional conflicts and armed hostilities , and has witnessed a trend towards the spread and destabilizing accumulation of sophisticated weapons systems , including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
I should like once again to refer to the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , which called upon the international community to take steps against nuclear proliferation and to renounce weapons of mass destruction , including those held for deterrent purposes .  
Our close cooperation becomes urgent when it is realized that a small group of terrorists can actually possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical ones , and destroy large areas of the world and millions of innocent people with wilful abandon , senselessly and indiscriminately .  
The provision relates to special conservation , treatment and safe storage of organic and non-organic material gathered by the Investigations Division as evidence from mass grave sites , buried possessions and decrepit archival facilities .  
Enhance mass media to spread information about sustainable development issues , specifically ideas for how to make a positive change from the personal to the international scale , and to become an educational tool through channels such as interconnected radio , television and the Internet ;

Social figures and mass media have questioned whether its deeds really suit its proclaimed nature and purpose when it registered the organization .  It is absolutely forbidden for any organization or individual to attempt to transform Hong Kong into a center for " Falungong " activities , to use Hong Kong as an anti-China base , to sabotage " one country , two systems , " or to sabotage Hong Kong 's social stability and prosperity .

Local people 's congresses with legislative power and their standing committees carried out anticipatory legislation in matters beyond the NPC and its standing committee 's exclusive legislative powers and where laws or administrative laws and regulations had yet to be drawn up , accumulating experience for the state to draw up corresponding laws .  
At the same time , the CPPCC must also strengthen ties with the party 's discipline inspection organs , state power organs , administrative supervisory organs , and judicial organs , cooperate with supervision by the media and other forms of mass supervision , and work in concert with all sides to promote the active , steady , sound , and effective progress of the CPPCC 's democratic supervision .

We have a rich and diversified cultural heritage , a bilingual open society and a free port .  
At times when our Sun is active , tremendous explosions known as flares and coronal mass ejections can hurl billions of tonnes of matter into space in one stroke .  These cataclysmic events can trigger magnetic storms on Earth , resulting in poor radio communications or disrupted power grids .  Potential hazards to astronauts or satellites in space can be even more serious .  
The Report also states : " The people of Hong Kong continued to enjoy a tradition of free speech and free press . . .  A wide and diverse range of opinions , including those critical of the Hong Kong and PRC Governments , are routinely aired in the mass media and public fora . "

Its stumbling reform measures have given rise to such adverse side effects as graft , corruption , and soaring prices at the same time as they whetted the ardent hopes of the people for complete reform , resulting in the mass movements in Tienanmen Square . - - The bloody suppression in Tienanmen Square not only exposed the true nature of the Communists ' tyrannous regime , it also pointed up the internal contradictions among the political ruling class .  
A plan for the long-term development of Taiwan 's infrastructure has been outlined as follows : To solve the problem of the over-concentration of population in the cities , a mass rapid-transit system has been drawn up for six major urban zones : Taipei , Taoyuan , Hsinchu , Taichung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung . The heart of each city serves as the focal center for a complex trans-portation network which will embrace all the suburban and outlying areas surrounding the city .  
In the past few years , because of other major infrastructure projects like the mass transit system , the second northern express , and the inland line , because many corporations had bought up the factory land early on for low prices , overnight the value of their assets became many times the capital investment .  
For example , Tang dynasty IOUs , contracts and accounts of interest rates provided economic historians with important evidence . All kinds of censuses , land records and documents of civic associations brought to light the pattern of land transfers and civil activities . Yet the mass of Buddhist sutras and ancient literature was even more important for instilling new life into literary , historical and philosophical research . Tunhuang studies had begun .  
No clear plan was set out for upgrading Taichung to a metropolis , nor for opening Taichung Harbor to direct cross-strait shipping ; the high-speed railway was diverted to a coastal route via new towns far from Taichung city ; the third international airport was planned for southern Taiwan ; no increases in numbers of universities and colleges were envisaged under the plan ; and the mass transit system urgently needed to solve Taichung 's transportation problems would n't be ready until the year 2020 ! "  
It was not long before they came to accept this as natural - - if you wanted to get ahead then you had to actively take part in the League , national mass study organizations and social work .

Altogether , there are probably no more than ten similar local drama troupes . Participants mostly have a sense that cultural development between the cities and the rural areas is too imbalanced : In Taipei arts groups are concentrated together and there are abundant performing arts . But elsewhere , after the powerful assault of the mass media , now everyone is bolted in front of the TV watching the same old TV personalities and plots that have nothing to do with their daily lives . Where have those dramas that reflect local life gone to ? "  
Usually found in the temperate zone , most of them were brought from abroad by migratory birds like the quillwort and the Sparganium fallax . Their taking root in the subtropical environment of Taiwan has greatly startled international botanists . Among them are plants found at their southern most geographical limit : The Nuphar shimadai is especially noteworthy because it belongs to temperate zone family of water plants found mostly in North America and the northern parts of the Eurasian land mass .  
Despite having been established for only a short time , in the last two " preparatory " years the bicycle R &amp; D center has already come up with sixteen applications for special patents to provide to manufacturers for mass production . Moreover , an even more important breakthrough has been creation of equipment for precise measuring of the mutual tolerance of the bicycle frame and the other parts ( in the past they could only make rough guesses ) , which saves the enterprises the trouble of muddling through for themselves .  
Liu Yu-shan , secretory-general of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , notes that right now the projects in which the Europeans , Americans , and Japanese are most interested are the high-tech ones . The main ones can be categorized as transportation ( the mass rapid transit system and the high-speed railroad ) , energy ( the fourth nuclear power and electrical generators ) , environmental protection ( incinerators ) , and the modernization of the postal and telecommunications networks .  
Researchers have endeavored to find the reasons why grey mullet production has been unstable in recent years . One important discovery is that although the cold water mass from the mainland heads south to Taiwan , if it is n't sustained , which is to say if it does n't come far enough south , then it wo n't be strong enough to get into that push-pull dynamic with the Kuroshio Current , so that the fish will not form into schools . "  
Because the ozone layer can absorb ultraviolet light from sunlight and block out most of the radiation harmful to life on earth , as the protective function of this layer is weakened , the incidence of diseases related to unltraviolet rays , such as skin cancer or cataracts , rises dramatically ; the immune systems of animals become repressed ; plant growth stagnates ; and it even leads to a drop in agricultural production and mass deaths in aquatic life .  
The faces of Buddhist Statues are mass produced in plastic ; the frames for final resting places are carved by machines and are ragged ; and course paper is used for the ceremonial spirit house , " says Master Hsu , angry about the superficiality of the living . As for whether the place where the deceased reside in the afterlife will leak water or collapse , that is of course part of the gap between this and the other world , and there is nothing anyone can do about it .  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers .

A dialogue between modernism and nativismLooking from the perspective of musical history , local Taiwanese music with its mass support and elitist experimental modern music must extend upwards or downwards respectively , into the third level of the musical pyramid , before they can intermingle to produce a " local music " which is capable of really expressing the feelings and aspirations of Taiwan 's people , but which can also be played on an international stage and be shared with other nations .  
If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious .

Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
It took only half the anticipated amount of time to get from initial design to mass production , greatly increasing efficiency .

However , it turned out that the cause was a loose door , and there was no threat to flight safety .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits . Thus , if VR core technology and peripheral equipment can be developed in time , not only will this spur industrial upgrading in Taiwan , it can reduce current high production costs through mass production .  
But because traffic is a more thorny problem in that part of the city , the site currently most favored by the city government is in the vicinity of the Sungshan tobacco factory in Nankang , a suburban area of northeast Taipei . This is further from the city center , a highway already goes by there , and a mass transit system station will soon be completed there . The city government argues that these will be of some help in moving large numbers of people .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
Lien Te-sen became famous for his work " MRT , " in which he rendered the character xing ( �� ) , meaning " motion , " in several disconnected pieces , and in the center drew the character gui ( �t ) , meaning " turtle , " in ancient seal script , thus mocking the progress of Taipei 's traffic and mass rapid transit system .  
Given that everyone is exposed to the mass media today , it is hard to ensure that the views and statements that senior citizens express about the past have not been guided by the current context . " It is very possible that , given a certain atmosphere in society , the interviewee knows very well what the interviewer is aiming at , and just tells him or her what they want to hear , " cautions Wang Ming-ko , an associate researcher at the Institute of History and Philology at the Academia Sinica .  
This summer , in the wake of Typhoon Herb , which brought 30-year record rainfall , the water level in both reservoirs rose past the warning mark , and both had to discharge excess water .

We must now simply wait to see what sort of reactions will be stirred by this encounter between the mass medium of radio , and the refined realm of classical music .  
Currently , the problem is that " there are no rules of the game . Just looking at circulation tricks to expand or maintain sales , apart from giving discounts , giving papers away for free is also common , " suggests mass communications scholar Hsu Chia-shih . There is no mutual trust in the newspaper industry , and there is no objective standard to determine " number of newspapers sold . " That is why they are so chilly toward the ABC .  
Leaving aside the earliest relations between man and elephant , it was beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries , when Europeans first penetrated the continent , that the African elephant began to face mass slaughter . After three centuries of killing , the elephant population was devastated . In Capetown , South Africa , for example , when the government established the national park in 1931 , there were only 11 elephants , compared to the historical peak when at least 100,000 elephants roamed the grassy plain .  
However , many artists are unwilling to let this 800-year-old Chinese folk tradition wither and die . In 1985 the Council for Cultural Planning and Development began an annual competition to select the best New Year 's prints . Each year many creative submissions combining tradition and contemporary styles are received , reflecting today 's actual mass culture .  
For the mass of ordinary people , who are impatient and full of worldly desires , the idea of heaven as an essentially illusory mental state achieved by self-cultivation is abstruse and complex , and the continuous , unrelenting effort required to enter such a state is both hard to understand and hard to achieve . Thus it is understandable that a " heaven " in which religious concepts are simplified and popularized is preferred by proselytizers .  
People have long been aware of the educational and recreational functions of museums . But now the global trend is toward moving the focus of museums away from the elite to the general public , and relating them more closely to the lives of the people who live nearby . From elite to mass

Taking as a precedent his approach to the Mass Rapid Transit System when he was mayor of Taipei , Chen says that during the mayoral elections he opposed the embryonic mass transit system , but he did not tear it down just to fulfill a campaign promise . Instead , he organized a group of experts from Taiwan and overseas to investigate the system , and , he says , resolved the problems by improving the MRTS .  
This cultural illness is particularly serious in United States . American girls begin to be extremely concerned about their appearance from high school on , and many people are constantly depressed about their weight . Though the situation is not so serious in Taiwan , the mass media puts out a virtually unvarying message that beauty equals success . It is difficult for young people to resist the message implied in teenage beauty pageants , love-at-first-sight stories pairing up beautiful girls and handsome guys , and the images of pop superstars .  
Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality . Living on borrowed time and borrowed culture , caught between the ersatz pleasures of the West and the call of historical destiny . . . . "

Thereafter , activists were absorbed into the mainstream political forces , and on both the political stage and in the business community they have played increasingly important roles . In these roles they have been given mixed reviews , being seen as " bold and idealistic " but also as naive " Boy Scouts . " The sixth and seventh generations-those aged 18-30 or so today , and thus the core group of interest to us here-are those of the age of mass university attendance .  
Intending to prevent a recurrence of Bunun resistance and because it was difficult to keep the garrison roads in good repair in the deep mountain areas , the Japanese government went a step further and forced a mass displacement of the Bunun down the mountain to the lower reaches of the Lakulaku River on the Huatung Valley plain . Through contact with the Han Chinese and the Amis people living there , the unique characteristics of Bunun mountain culture were gradually lost .  
Due to Taiwan 's unique geographical position and diverse alpine terrain , as well as the numerous avenues for the immigration of new species-including transport by ocean currents , settlement by migratory birds , the mass migration of species during the ice age when Taiwan and the Chinese mainland were connected-the high level of biodiversity on the island greatly exceeds that of any other place on Earth .

For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds , the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including , where applicable , the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights . "  
It follows that the existence of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights in a country does not as such constitute a sufficient ground for determining that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture upon his return to that country ; additional grounds must exist that indicate that the individual concerned would be personally at risk .  
We are confident that a Middle East zone free of nuclear and weapons of mass destruction would enhance the peace process and lead to a situation wherein enormous financial resources would be saved and channelled towards the economic prosperity and social development of the peoples of the region .  
Our people find it astonishing that in an era of such developed mass communication , which leaves no distance between different corners of the globe , the apparently insurmountable difficulties in particular , the actual causes of the continuing imposed war are not understood .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
Globalization , an all-inclusive term conceived in the interests of the major transnational corporations , is now devouring national entities , sovereignty and independence beyond any limit or reason , bringing in its wake a global invasion of destitution , population growth , mass migration and environmental degradation , which can not be avoided by even the most powerful of this world .  
The arrogant approach and attitude of the Government of the United States of America towards the international community , and the unsuccessful attempts of the American foreign policy establishment to exploit issues of global concern , such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , to advance an extraneous and illegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed dangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral measures .  
Another main reason for this failure is that the policies of major arms-producing countries designed to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons are always short-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at securing the destructive power of their own weaponry and their own military dominance .  
These obligations include achieving complete nuclear disarmament , expanding the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , strengthening the role and enhancing the authority of the IAEA as the only international body competent to oversee the good-faith discharge of Member States ' responsibilities under the Treaty , ensuring the universality of the NPT as an urgent priority , and establishing the Middle East as a zone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
It is hard , however , to speak about either a successful and broad application of the educational potential of sport or sporting achievements in a country where the mass aspect of sport one of its fundamental principles has been violated as a result of aggression by the neighbouring Republic of Armenia .  
My Government also considers that all the steps and measures taken by the Israeli occupation authorities with the aim of altering the legal status and demographic character of the Palestinian and Arab occupied territories , particularly with regard to Al-Quds , are null and void and constitute a serious breach of international law .  Peace , security , stability and development in the Middle East require the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the region , including nuclear weapons .  
However , severe problems of unemployment , poverty and income distribution have grown worse in many places , contributing to political instability , mass migration , environmental stress , and ethnic conflict .  
Besides the fact that it continues to be the most universal and fundamental instrument for the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons , its extension demonstrated the international community 's common desire to reject all weapons of mass destruction .  
Surely it is more than mere symbolism that the very first resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its first session , on 24 January 1946 , was devoted to limiting the use of atomic energy to peaceful purposes , and to eliminating from national arsenals atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction .  
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
In short , the practical achievement of that purpose in the present international context entails preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , further strengthening existing conventions in this field , pursuing the process of nuclear disarmament , limiting and reducing existing conventional arsenals and establishing confidence - and security-building measures .  
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
There is no doubt that the international agreements and instruments that have been concluded to date and have become an integral part of international law have had a far-reaching effect in limiting the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction and have been instrumental in shaping international expectations in this area .  
Calls upon all States in the Middle East to take practical steps in appropriate forums aimed at making progress towards , inter alia , the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear , chemical and biological , and their delivery systems , and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective .  
In conclusion , Nigeria would like to see the First Committee at this historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly motivated by the desire for cooperation in finding genuine and lasting solutions to those problems that continue to confront us in the area of disarmament in the remaining part of this twentieth century , in order to bequeath to the next generation in the twenty-first century a world which is indeed free of these weapons of mass destruction . 
Secondly , the elimination of nuclear weapons , whether immediate or gradual , would certainly lead to the attainment of a world free of nuclear weapons and eventually of all weapons of mass destruction and would facilitate complete and general disarmament which , in turn , would ease tensions in the world at large and help redirect financial and other resources to economic and social development .  
Despite the achievements of the first half of the Decade in reducing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and also in limiting conventional weapons , the road towards the noble objective of the Third Disarmament Decade remains a long and winding one .  
In this so-called new era in which bipolar confrontation no longer exists , it is especially regrettable that the international community should be unable to arrive at a firm commitment on nuclear disarmament and on the complete elimination of these weapons of mass destruction , which continue to endanger the very survival of the human race .  
Serious violations of human rights and the mass exodus of a considerable portion of the Haitian population for political or economic reasons called for prompt and resolute action on the part of the international community , the United Nations and the Organization of American States .  
In general , it was noted that the main factors constraining the development of sustainable national capacities include ( a ) the absence of an enabling public sector environment ; ( b ) the lack of a critical mass of suitably trained and motivated counterparts ; ( c ) high turnover ; and ( d ) the non-fulfilment of national budgetary and in-kind commitments .  
There was a need to continue the search for more effective measures to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of which posed a threat to peace and international security , especially given the growing number of regional and internal conflicts .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
Supported by a relatively strong foundation in science and technology and a critical mass of skilled human resources in the field of biological sciences , many countries , especially those in Central and Eastern Europe , can , with appropriate and timely support from the international community , move forward rapidly in biotechnology development and its safe applications .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
The most drastic examples of abuse of the members of the Albanian national minority are placing of children in the front rows of separatist demonstrations , spreading rumour about alleged mass poisoning of Albanian children and the forcibly preventing the young generation from acquiring compulsory elementary education and other levels of education in their mother tongue for which Serbia and Yugoslavia have provided all necessary material , financial and personnel conditions .  
The investigation of the complaint would require questioning suspects , victims and witnesses , collecting documentary and other forensic evidence , ensuring that appropriate chains of custody of evidence are maintained , conducting searches , conducting mass grave exhumations where necessary , undertaking local inquiries and coordinating with various national authorities and other investigation agencies .  
It is estimated that an amount of $ 100,000 would be required for human rights education and public information in Guatemala to educate and keep the public civic organizations and the mass media , both national and international , informed of the Mission 's activities and findings .  
Further areas of concern related to biological weapons , new types of weapons of mass destruction , radiological weapons , limitation and reduction of conventional weapons and international arms transfers , the prevention of an arms race in outer space , curbing the naval arms race , naval armaments and disarmament , and reduction of military budgets .  
Systematic violation of human rights and freedoms : mass arrests , abductions and murders , pent-up political trials , forcible mobilizations , evictions and ethnic cleansing , plunder , disrespect of religious freedoms , not acknowledging of national and religious institutions of the Bosniac-Moslems .  
Despite an almost total information blockade and the restriction of the movement of representatives of international organizations by the Croatian side under various pretexts , foreign media have managed to inform the world public about some of the atrocities and the systematic drive of the Croatian military and civilian authorities to erase the traces of these atrocities by burning the dead , burying them in unmarked mass graves or by washing the streets and roads to remove the evidence .  
These included : empowerment of women as an overall concept ; mass media ; statistics and indicators on gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development : water , waste management and sanitation ; renewable energy ; and issues related to different groups of female population such as the ageing , displaced ; refugees and migrants .  50 .  The Board decided that INSTRAW should introduce the following in its new programme , among other subjects :  
In many developing countries there is an apparent lack of a " critical mass " of qualified managers , technicians , and skilled workers needed to support basic levels of public sector activity .  
It is India 's considered view that before the Security Council embarks on any action to formally give itself a " role in the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction " , all substantive , legal and institutional issues , including the role of specific treaty bodies , must be addressed and resolved through an open and transparent debate among the full membership of the United Nations .  
A regional project in southern Africa is providing training to managers and field workers in interpersonal communication skills and the use of low-cost audiovisual materials .  Rural radio remains the most effective mass medium to reach large numbers of rural audiences and FAO is continuing its efforts to strengthen rural radio services , especially in Africa .  
Weak economic and accounting data systems , poor tender procedures , secrecy of budget documents and deficient mass media were identified as the main explanatory factors .  
By the horrifying indiscriminate mass artillery and missile bombardment of predominantly civilian targets in all the towns of Serb Krajina , Croatia unambiguously demonstrated that one of its main goals , apart from imposing its sovereignty over Krajina , was to inflict heavy losses on the civilian population and by so doing incite a mass exodus of Serbs in order to create an ethnically pure Croat state .  
While the number of those killed , beaten , detained and sexually assaulted remains unknown , consistent accounts by displaced persons and United Nations personnel lead to a strong presumption that Bosnian Serb soldiers committed substantial violations of international humanitarian law following the fall of Srebrenica , including mass arbitrary detention of civilian men and boys , and summary executions .  
The question must be raised : what possible moral authority do NATO and the United Nations have to pursue a relentless campaign of mass bombardment of the Republic of Srpska , causing unprecedented material damage and numerous civilian casualties ?  
Massive violations of human rights , especially in the form of genocide , " ethnic cleansing " as a strategy of war and its consequences , rape , including systematic rape of women in war situations , creating mass exodus of refugees and displaced persons , are abhorrent practices that are strongly condemned and must be immediately stopped , while perpetrators of such crimes must be punished .  
The mass media must also be mobilized with the support of non-governmental organizations , at the level of both States and regional organizations , in order to ensure the periodic dissemination of human rights information .  In addition , greater efforts must be made by the mass media to avoid propagating racist prejudice and stereotypes and to help the general public to form responsible critical opinions on the increasingly tragic events which tend to be trivialized in some circles .  
For this purpose , the central bank should promote the establishment , on a volunteer basis , of a critical mass of primary dealers who must satisfy certain minimum criteria ( such as observing minimum capital standards ) to possess the financial capacity to support the government securities market , and encourage competition .  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
His delegation was therefore pleased that the Commission had decided to refer to the Drafting Committee only the articles concerned with aggression , genocide , systematic or mass violations of human rights , and exceptionally serious war crimes ; that decision demonstrated that the Commission was directing its work towards a realistic , rather than a political concept of crimes against the peace and security of mankind .  
If the level of women 's representation of between 30 and 35 per cent and above is considered to form a critical mass , the Secretariat can be considered to have achieved that status in such occupational groups as political affairs , legal affairs , public information , administration , social affairs , economic affairs , human resources and human rights .  
The Croatian aggression resulted in major and forcible demographic displacement in the areas under the protection of the United Nations forces , i.e . , in mass resettlement and exodus of the Serbian population , violation of human rights , burning and destruction of their property including the Orthodox places of worship and Serbian cultural and historical monuments .  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
Teams of experts provided by the Netherlands , Norway , Spain , Switzerland and the United States of America undertook special investigations into acts of genocide , including a comprehensive survey by forensic experts of massacre and mass grave sites , interviews of surviving victims and witnesses , and the collection and preservation of documentary and other tangible evidence .  
Along with the rest of the international community , her Government had been appalled by the callous treatment of vulnerable groups in that area and continued to be concerned about the fate of missing persons within the territory of the former Yugoslavia and the indications that mass executions might have taken place .  
Thanks to free enterprise , a number of popular daily and weekly newspapers enjoyed mass circulation and dozens of private radio stations and some independent television companies were now in operation .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
In India , programmes to guarantee employment to the rural poor and unemployed youth , meet the nutritional , educational and health needs of women and promote their empowerment , and mass literacy programmes were central to the realization of situation-specific strategies .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
In view of the obvious link between human rights violations , the mass displacement of persons and the emergence of threats to international peace and security , Russia agreed with UNHCR that human rights monitoring must be one of the preventive measures included in plans for United Nations peace-keeping activities and in negotiations on peaceful settlement of disputes , and that safeguarding human rights was closely linked to the protection of refugees .

gravely concerned at reports , including by the Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
Democracy , sustainable development , social justice , environmental protection and the promotion of global peace and security were goals which could not be achieved unless disputes were settled by peaceful means and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was stopped .  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
this regard , we have read with grave concern the latest report of the Secretary-General , further confirming earlier reports that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most , all in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
adds a dramatic picture of new , appalling violations of humanitarian law that have taken place more recently in the Banja Luka region : a large-scale resumption of ethnic cleansing ; new cases of persons unaccounted for ; and chilling evidence , discovered in Sanski Most , of mass executions .  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
Supreme Council discussed Iraq 's implementation of Security Council resolutions relating to its aggression against Kuwait and expressed its deep concern that the Iraqi Government was continuing to fail to implement in full some fundamental aspects of its international obligations under those resolutions and its dubious conduct with regard to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , which constituted a violation of the terms of the cease-fire laid down in resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant United Nations resolutions .  
The destruction , massacres and immeasurable suffering in Lebanon reported by the mass media , which show human bodies that have been cut up and mutilated , is unequivocal proof of the barbaric nature of the aggression taking place at the hands of the Israelis .  
Other pressing issues include the population explosion , environmental degradation , the water shortage , desertification , the food deficit , the growing gap between the North and the South , the regional arms race , the threat posed by nuclear weapons , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , development concerns , barriers to economic and trade cooperation , the removal of restrictions on free trade and , last but not least , human rights .  
Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities of stemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction , bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building capabilities , advancing sustainable economic and social development , and reinforcing our joint commitment to international law and human rights ? 
The increased number and growing sophistication of lethal nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons of mass destruction and the further development of their intercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat of annihilation for many countries and peoples , especially when some of the countries which possess them lack even minimal credibility .  
While actively supporting the Commission , the Sultanate of Oman would point out that such efforts alone can not guarantee equitable security in the region if they are not paired with other effective and practical measures to eliminate weapons of mass destruction there and to promote comprehensive and unconditional acceptance of international monitoring and inspection of all activities related to this matter .  
At a time when most third-world countries are facing enormous challenges that hamper their advance towards greater progress and prosperity , and while our planet is facing environmental challenges that threaten the future of all life on Earth , considerable resources are being devoted to the production , refinement and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction of all kinds , while official development assistance continues to decline .  
Firmly and consistently committed to the course of democratic development pursued by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan , Mr . Emomali Rakhmonov , the Government of my country promotes the involvement of the broad mass of the population in social , political and economic reform processes through such mechanisms as referendums , national elections to representative bodies , renovation of the judicial system and every possible encouragement of openness .  
We believe that , with the treaties and bilateral agreements concluded , and the ongoing negotiations among the nuclear-weapon States , and also with the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year , the international community is now reaffirming its commitment to global disarmament and renewing the hopes for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
In spite of obstructions and misinformation campaigns , the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to articulate and pursue initiatives and measures aimed at fostering greater regional confidence ; enhancing respect for principles of international law ; bringing about transparency in armaments and reduction of military spending ; creating zones free from weapons of mass destruction ; strengthening peace and security through persistent endeavours to encourage and facilitate understanding and conciliation ; and consolidating economic cooperation .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
The ideal way of achieving this objective is not by applying arbitrary measures in the form of cutbacks , mass dismissals or redeployment , but by applying the guidelines of the General Assembly on personnel issues consistently , while observing and bolstering the principle that the Secretariat must be accountable in a strict and transparent fashion for the execution of the mandates entrusted to it by the Organization 's only universal organ that is , the General Assembly .  
Given the progress made to date , we can not forget that we must move towards prohibiting and completely eliminating this kind of weapon , because of its mass , indiscriminate and devastating effects , its long-term threat , its tragic human consequences and its widespread hindrance of the productive use of broad areas , particularly affecting those most in need and seriously jeopardizing the living conditions of many peoples .  
The systematic efforts to annihilate 20-million Iraqis were contrary to all international instruments , which must lead the international community to consider economic sanctions as an internationally prohibited weapon of mass destruction , since the application of sanctions against Iraq had caused significantly more victims than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima , which was ironic in the extreme given the degree of interest currently evinced in human rights . 
The Final Declaration of the summit of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , meeting in Cartagena last year , expressed the Movement 's support for the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament as being an opportunity to review , from a perspective more in tune with the current international situation , the most critical aspects of disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in favour of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and of the control and reduction of conventional weapons .  
He deplored the continuing flagrant mass violations of human rights taking place throughout the world , and concluded that the protection and promotion of human rights was a long and exacting task which required the undivided attention and vigilance of all members of the international community , from United Nations bodies and national Governments to non-governmental organizations and individuals .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
Politicians must be involved in its formulation ; politically compelling arguments for forest conservation and sustainable forestry development must be found ; and a critical mass of well-informed and motivated key decision makers committed to the plan or programme must be created .  
Genocide , aggression , systematic or mass violations of human rights , exceptionally serious war crimes , international terrorism and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs were covered in the draft ; those crimes represented the most serious breaches of the peace and security of mankind .  
Experience has served to design a comprehensive project for the dissemination of and education in human and indigenous rights , through integrated mass public information campaigns that use media and messages tailored to the population 's socio-economic and cultural context and give particular importance to the multi-ethnic nature of Guatemala .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and the university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Also gravely concerned at reports , including by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
In this context , we hope that Iraq will create the conditions and climate necessary for achieving this objective , through full cooperation with the Special Commission established to supervise the elimination of all Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , and through the provision , at the earliest possible date , of complete , comprehensive and final information on all elements of its proscribed programmes .  
The technical and professional posts remaining in the Department for Development Support and Management Services were to constitute the minimal critical mass needed to provide substantive support to overall planning and management activities in mineral resources in line with the mandate of the Department .  
In addition , the documents were prepared on the following subjects : protection aspects of UNHCR activities on behalf of internally displaced persons ; comprehensive and regional approaches to refugee problems ; recommendations of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) / UNHCR Symposium on Refugees and forced Population Displacements in Africa ; and the scope of international protection in mass influx ; as well as a note on current UNHCR activities on behalf of stateless persons .  
A mass of detailed research in recent years has revealed a rich fabric of support networks and mutual or community-based initiatives to deal with everyday problems of economic survival and social functioning .  
To promote awareness in Africa and in the international community of the nature of the critical economic and social situation in Africa , and of the domestic and international efforts required for recovery and development , through wide dissemination of the periodical African Recovery to the general public and to target groups such as parliamentarians , non-governmental organizations , trade unions and academic institutions , as well as through outreach to the African and international mass media ;  
In this connection , the Council pledges its continued political and material support for the efforts of the United Nations Special Commission entrusted with the elimination of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction and invites the international community to participate actively in supporting the Commission 's efforts in every way possible in order to enable it to achieve its objective of placing the security and stability of the region on a firm foundation .  
The limits to be defined in the submission from a coastal State with a continental shelf that extends beyond 200 nautical miles are to be based on distances measured with respect to " the foot of the continental slope " near the edge of the submerged prolongation of its land mass .  
The sediment thickness rule provides States the opportunity to optimize the extent of the outer continental shelf boundary and is intended to define the effective seaward limit of the sedimentary wedge derived from the land mass .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
Improvements over the existing systems include higher spatial and spectral resolutions in both the visible and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum , more frequent imaging , air mass analysis and more timely data dissemination .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
In addition , comprehensive media support , based on permanent cooperation with the mass media ( national radio and television services , regional radio services , press ) has been developed and gradually strengthened by :  
Israel 's refusal to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , when it possesses enormous numbers of nuclear weapons , is developing other weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery and refuses to place its facilities under international supervision and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards , not only flouts the wishes of the international community but also constitutes a grave and persistent threat to the security and the future of the peoples of the region and , consequently , to international peace and security .  
The Plan of Action has five objectives : the assessment of needs and formulation of strategies ; building and strengthening human rights education programmes at the international , regional , national and local levels ; developing and coordinating the development of human rights education materials ; strengthening the role of the mass media ; and promoting the global dissemination of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development , whose establishment had been one of the most important results of the Rio Conference , played a vital role in mobilizing a political commitment to safeguard the environment and was promoting sustainable consumption patterns , a particularly relevant issue in view of the threat to the environment posed by the culture of mass consumption fostered by the market mechanisms that were being introduced into the developing world .  
Concerning the use of national human resources , he said that the national staff of UNDP were among its most valuable resources ; in many of the field offices , the only international staff members were the resident representatives and their deputies , while all the others were nationals , who were generally experienced in the work of UNDP programmes and projects , familiar with the culture and language , and frequently had worked for the Government , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the mass media . 
In recent years , owing to fragmentation of States into newly independent countries , the twin problems of forced relocation of populations and mass expulsions , including the so-called " ethnic cleansing " operations , have resulted in the involuntary displacement of millions of people as well as considerable suffering and loss of life and property .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
The limited mass , volume , stability and optics of microsatellites could not compete with traditional large-scale missions such as the Land Remote Sensing Satellite ( LANDSAT ) , Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) and the European remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) ; however , for medium resolution and meteorological-scale imaging , the KITSAT and POSAT satellites had demonstrated a comparable facility but at a tiny fraction of the cost .  
Being aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Thus , the main lesson learned to date indicates that , while promoting new small enterprises may have helped to create a thriving SME sector , it has not so far created a sufficient mass of vigorous and innovative medium-sized enterprises capable of becoming a driving force for a healthy market economy .  
A five-year plan had been prepared for the Afro-Colombian population to give impetus to the organization of their communities , through the strengthening of advisory committees at the departmental , regional and district levels and the undertaking of research projects , and particularly one aimed at compiling basic statistical data on that population group and another aimed at preparing a map of socio-cultural zones and regions with majority black populations .  The five-year plan also provided for dissemination activities in coordination with the mass media .  
It laid down guidelines for concerted action by Governments and the United Nations system to take effective measures to eliminate contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination and encouraged the mass media to promote ideas of tolerance and understanding .

Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Appropriate institutions of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , workers ' and employers ' organizations , labour unions , the mass media , religious organizations , community organizations , the family , independent information , resource and training centres and others , for the purpose of incorporating human rights education into non-formal programmes , should be encouraged and assisted in developing and delivering such non-formal programmes , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes .  
Accordingly , in light of the international strategic importance of the Gulf region , the Council renewed its call to the international community and the relevant international organizations to make active efforts to transform that region into a zone free of weapons of mass destruction .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
A culture of peace will contribute to international cooperation for economic and social development and sustained economic growth in the developing countries of our world and permit the billions of dollars spent each year on armaments of death and mass destruction to be directed towards eradicating poverty , facilitating human development and making our world a better place to live in for all , developed and developing countries alike .  
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .  
We are concerned at the constant threat to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States coming from Afghanistan ; the flow of narcotics and contraband weapons ; reports that reach us about gross violations of humanitarian law by the warring factions , including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war ; the blockade by the Taliban of the central regions of Afghanistan populated by the Hazara people , and the continuing large-scale violations of human rights , particularly the rights of women and children .  
As we can see , these hidden weapons of mass destruction continue to cause irreversible damage in Central America , even though the Esquipulas process to achieve final peace in the region has already achieved its objective , putting an end to the armed conflict in Guatemala , and even though it is now seven and five years , respectively , since the civil wars ended in Nicaragua and El Salvador . The cruelty of these weapons is overwhelming . 
We therefore appeal from this rostrum for merging our efforts at the Government and organizational level , both inter-State and voluntary , to galvanize our will and generate our energies , both official and at the mass level , in order to provide material and technical resources to implement practical and well-considered programmes to achieve this end .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
The non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction requires of the international community a comprehensive approach that will take into account the horizontal , vertical and qualitative aspects of non-proliferation as well as the exchange , for peaceful purposes , of technology , information , equipment and materials related to those weapons , including the establishment of control mechanisms for possible dual usage .  
The disarmament and international security agenda for the future can be comprehensively addressed with regard to both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons through the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
In considering the allocation of resources to disarmament , the United Nations should not only take into account the priority which this necessitates and the high emphasis given to it by the entire international community ; it should also be focused on the work that is already being done and still needs to be done by the international community on the future agenda to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction and to halt the proliferation of conventional weapons beyond the legitimate requirements of self-defence .  
The highest priority for the international community , therefore , should continue to remain the ultimate and complete elimination of nuclear weapons as was laid down in the Final Document of SSOD I . The agenda should also include measures on the elimination of the other weapons of mass destruction , in particular chemical and biological weapons , through the full implementation of relevant disarmament treaties . 
While urbanization and economic growth are linked and are regarded as dominant features of national economic development , rapid urbanization will pose enormous challenges for the urban social and physical environment , particularly in terms of the widespread poverty that results from mass unemployment .  
While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
At the same time the Commission further defined the mandate of the expert by requesting him to coordinate his efforts with other international actors in the field , to prepare a comprehensive plan concerning the excavation of mass graves and the exhumation of mortal remains , and to assume responsibility for securing appropriate support , including financial assistance , for these tasks .  
PHR is a Boston-based non _ governmental organization of forensic anthropologists , archaeologists , pathologists and other health professionals that seeks to use medical and scientific knowledge to protect human rights and promote accountability for violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular by investigating mass graves to identify victims of extrajudicial executions .  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
UNTAES is requested to continue its support in this respect .  In particular , all suspected mass grave sites need to be guarded and demined , and the forensic experts need to be provided with full personal security and protection while exhuming mortal remains in the field .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines including engineers .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
This should include appropriate delegation of authority , enhancement of the capacity of the staff through training and the provision of a stable resource base to ensure the continuous presence of an institutional critical mass .  A first step in that direction would be for Headquarters to provide urgent assistance by assigning to Nairobi for one month a senior administrator with proven experience in the establishment and functioning of United Nations common services outputs ( SP-96-001-19 ) .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Recognizing that the missing are - with very few , if any , exceptions - deceased , the local authorities , my Office and other members of the international community have focused efforts on the exhumation of mass graves and the clearing of unburied mortal remains .  
Recognizes that institutions responsible for sustaining the rule of law play an important role in removing the causes of mass exoduses and , in this context , calls on the High Commissioner to continue his efforts , at the request of the Governments concerned , to reinforce national legal , judicial and administrative capacity , including training opportunities through technical cooperation programmes in countries of origin as well as host countries , particularly developing countries ;  
Recognizes that the causes of mass exoduses are often of a structural nature and are directly linked to the prevailing unjust and inequitable international political and economic order , and notes in this regard that the study of purely national aspects alone will not reveal the real roots of the problem ;  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
The international community of States ( the United Nations , OSCE , CIS and the European Parliament ) , in condemning the policy of " ethnic cleansing " in the form of mass extermination and forcible expulsion of the predominantly Georgian population of Abkhazia , has affirmed the unacceptability of refusing to allow them to return to Abkhazia and of forcibly changing the demographic composition of Abkhazia , Georgia . 
The telephone numbers and addresses of those responsible shall be provided to the population through the mass media to be used by citizens in critical situations ; on receiving the signal , those responsible must arrive at the place of the incident accompanied by an expert doctor , a lawyer and the persons involved .  
While there are many similarities between the practice of forced evictions and internal displacement , population transfer , mass expulsions , mass exodus , ethnic cleansing and other practices involving the coerced and involuntary movement of people from their homes , lands and communities , forced evictions constitute a distinct practice under international law .  
Urges all States to be guided in their national policies by the need to curb the testing , the production and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering ;  
Decides to authorize Ms . Ferero Ucros to prepare , without financial implications , a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering .  
A reign of terror has been let loose , characterized by extrajudicial executions , indiscriminate killings , random and mass arrests for political reasons , forced relocation of the population , gang rapes of women and systematic efforts to obliterate the ethnic , social and cultural identity of the Kashmiri people .  
It seems to us that the CD , with its accumulated experience of complex disarmament negotiations on weapons of mass destruction , is the ideal forum in which to carry forward discussions on the technical and legal questions which must be confronted if we are to achieve the elimination of nuclear weapons .  
It was regrettable that racial hatred , intolerance , ethnic persecution and unchecked political ambitions were continuing to cause conflicts leading to such mass movements .  
The replaced Taliban forces north of Kabul , however , are being brought daily to Kunduz civilian airport for further acts of genocide in northern Afghanistan , of which the ethnically oriented carnage and the burial in a mass grave on 14 September 1997 of more than 100 civilians in the village of Qizil-Abad , in northern Balkh province , as reported by the Reuters correspondent Alistair Lyon , is a testimony . 
These measures are intrinsically linked to the just and lasting resolution of conflicts , the peaceful settlement of disputes , concrete and effective measures of disarmament through the accession of all the States of the region to the multinational agreements on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction ( the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Chemical Weapons Convention , the Biological Weapons Convention , etc . ) , and to the placement of all nuclear installations under international control .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
The gap in socio-economic development between the countries of the south and north of the region is widening , there remains in the area a critical mass of combustible material the Middle East conflict and the as yet unsettled Cyprus problem , and there is a high level of saturation with weapons , accompanied by the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
The main objectives of the Institute are : to raise public awareness for human rights ; to further educate civil servants , teachers , lawyers on human rights ; to strengthen human rights education in the Cyprus educational system at all levels ; to strengthen the capacity of the mass media for human rights education by appropriate means ; to promote the active engagement of national non-governmental organizations in the realization of the goals of the Decade ; and to establish a human rights library in order to enhance public awareness .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and longer lasting , combining inter-State and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions and , in some cases , natural disasters .  
One of the key provisions in this context is article 17 , under which States parties recognize the important function performed by the mass media and shall ensure that the child has access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources , especially those aimed at the promotion of his or her social , spiritual and moral well-being and physical and mental health .  
It is therefore our common task and responsibility to seize this historic opportunity , provided by the present international environment , to work together for the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and for the regulation and control of other conventional tools of killing .  
The study might also include ( a ) knowledge about human rights among the general population , as well as potential target groups ; ( b ) social , political and economic conditions relevant to human rights education ; ( c ) human rights educational access for marginalized groups ; and ( d ) treatment of human rights issues by the mass media ( including television , radio , newspapers and popular magazines ) .  
At its fiftieth session , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 182 of 22 December 1995 , entitled Human rights and mass exoduses , in which it , inter alia , acknowledged that mass exoduses of populations were caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation .  
United Nations treaty bodies , special rapporteurs , representatives and independent experts have regularly provided valuable information on specific human rights problems having the potential of generating mass exoduses or preventing their resolution , together with recommendations for corrective measures .  
An effective human rights regime , secured by institutions that support the rule of law , including an independent judicial system accessible to all and an accountable public administration , is also of paramount importance for the creation of a stable society and thus conducive to consolidating peace and preventing the recurrence of mass exodus .  
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
While these developments are not in themselves sufficient to dispel our anxieties about the safety of our planet from the threat of weapons of mass destruction , we should seize the moment and take concrete steps to consolidate the limited gains that have been realized , and move to resolve the outstanding disagreements which have stalled initiatives to find lasting solutions to fundamental disarmament issues .  
One of the main tasks of the conference could be to draw up , in cooperation with other interested international organizations , a United Nations strategy for the regulation of migratory flows and the prevention of mass forced population displacement at the global level .  
As Member States will recall , this paper became a basis for General Assembly resolution 48 / 87 , by which the Assembly , among other things , further adopted a thematic approach to cluster items into 10 broad topics : nuclear weapons ; other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; confidence-building measures , including transparency in armaments ; outer space disarmament aspects ; disarmament machinery ; other disarmament measures ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Other national legislation relevant to the regime governing the right to freedom of opinion and expression includes article 7 of the Civil Code concerning defamation , providing that upon decision of a court , the mass medium concerned and the officials or citizens responsible shall make compensation in the degree set by the court for moral ( non-property ) injury caused to a citizen as a result of the dissemination by the mass media of inaccurate information damaging to his honour , dignity or business reputation .  
We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
Our commitment to the setting up of such a court stems from the fact that this court would be a landmark development in the creation of a balanced and effective system aimed at ensuring that international crimes , especially mass violations of basic fundamental human rights , do not remain unpunished .  
The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination . 
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .  
It was a positive contribution by the Court to the realization of the goal of total elimination of nuclear weapons , which must be pursued by the international community if we are to eliminate the possibility of this planet , and all the people on it , being annihilated by these horrendous weapons of mass destruction .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
In addition to these illegal Israeli settlement activities , numerous reports and documents of the United Nations provide ample description of the systematic inhumane practices of the Zionist regime , including arbitrary mass arrests , detention and shooting of Palestinians , sealing or demolition of homes and internal closure of the territories .  
In its resolution 1996 / 51 , the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ third session an update of the report of the Secretary-General on human rights and mass exoduses ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 42 ) , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to that resolution , as well as all relevant information on the human rights situations creating or affecting refugees and displaced persons .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled " Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights " , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
The Government considered that the use of force , foreign occupation or domination , and unilateral economic coercion or international sanctions to resolve conflicts , halt violations of human rights and promote democracy , were factors in creating refugees and mass exoduses .  
Furthermore , it was noted that unbalanced international political relations were often an important factor in the occurrence of mass exoduses through the threat to use force or interference in a country 's internal affairs , as was happening in the case of Iraq , where direct or indirect interference by the United States of America and some of its allies was creating tension , encouraging some of the population to leave , particularly for neighbouring countries .  
While several Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in their replies emphasized the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to the problems of mass exoduses , as well as the need to pay special attention to the continuum of emergency to development assistance , others provided information on more specific programmes or on current developments in their respective countries .  
The Note outlined several elements indispensable in protection-based comprehensive approaches to avoiding mass displacement , such as upholding the international rule of law , including relevant human rights and refugee law principles , which should be seen as positive and enabling components of any comprehensive approach .  
The United Nations Department for Public Information ( DPI ) highlighted the important role of public information in raising awareness of the question of human rights and mass exodus , highlighting activities such as the production of print material , films , radio and television programmes and radio documentaries , as well as collaborating with NGOs and coordinating inter-agency promotional activities .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
The Government of Ukraine pointed out that it considered it vital to expand the efforts for preventive measures with a view to identifying and forestalling the main causes of mass exoduses and the emergence of new refugee and migrant populations , including the establishment of efficient rapid response and early _ warning mechanisms to deal with crisis situations .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , HCHR / CHR has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .  
The major activities included the completion of a full environmental test campaign ( thermal vacuum , vibration , RF , and mass properties measurements ) on the Canadian MSAT M1 satellite ( successfully launched on 20 April 1996 ) , and the initiation of environmental testing on the various components ( motor modules , joints , latching end effectors , and the mobile base system ) for Canada 's contribution to the international Space Station Project , the Mobile Servicing System .  
The first was the signing at Cairo of the African Nuclear _ Weapon _ Free Zone Treaty as a testimony to the developing countries ' commitment to the cause of nuclear disarmament worldwide and also as a positive and encouraging step which should be followed soon by the negotiation of the establishment of another zone in the Middle East in conformity with the relevant United Nations General Assembly resolutions and as a step towards the implementation of President Mubarak 's proposal concerning the establishment of a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .  
Pursuant to my letter to you dated 19 January 1997 concerning the forcible transfer and deportation of the civilian population of the districts north of Kabul ( S / 1997 / 54 , annex ) , I inform you with deep sorrow that the inhuman practice of mass deportation of ethnic Tajik residing in the districts north of Kabul is being continued by the Taliban mercenaries .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
My Government is fully confident that , provided there is political will , tangible action addressing conventional weapons would not be beyond the scope either of the ability or the competence of a forum that has to its credit the successful negotiation of bans on whole categories of weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons .  
Van der Stoel 's allegations concerning mass arrests in northern Iraq are pure fabrications , since everyone is aware of that region 's special status and the consequences of the abnormal situation in which it finds itself , being outside the scope of the State administration due to foreign military intervention and the establishment of air exclusion zones .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
The country does not have the technical , physical or human resources to manufacture weapons of mass destruction , since its principal concern is to promote its economic development plan and to mitigate the adverse impact that the coercive measures imposed on our people have had on all aspects of life .  
I am convinced that integrating support for policy formulation , analytical and normative functions and relevant technical cooperation activities will serve to reinforce the necessary critical mass available at Headquarters for this indispensable aspect of the work of the Organization and the overall effectiveness of the Secretariat .  
He was convinced that integrating substantive support for policy formulation , analytical and normative functions , and relevant technical cooperation activities would serve to reinforce the necessary critical mass available at Headquarters for that indispensable aspect of the Organization 's work and the overall effectiveness of the Secretariat .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
The approach represents the satellite as a combination of individual elements and positions these to provide maximum protection to the satellite components .  [ 29 ] The PLATFORM model uses a novel element termed SHIELD [ 30 ] which uses genetic algorithms to determine the optimal configuration of a spacecraft based on the encountered environment and design constraints such as thermal and mass balancing .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
The Ministerial Council reaffirmed its absolute and unwavering belief in Iraq 's obligation to comply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular those pertaining to the release of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and detainees ; cooperate fully with the Special Commission in its investigation of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction ; return all public and private property to Kuwait ; continue to comply fully with the compensation mechanism ; and refrain from all hostile or provocative acts directed against Kuwait and neighbouring States , pursuant to resolution 949 ( 1994 ) .  
For sustained economic growth and sustainable development , a critical mass is necessary not only in physical infrastructure but also in an educated and skilled workforce .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
Decides to authorize the inclusion of this question in the preliminary document concerning a study in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , to be submitted to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The Middle East region represents a case in point , where the qualitative imbalance in terms of armaments is so striking and where transparency and confidence can only come about if approached in a balanced and comprehensive way .  Applying transparency in the Middle East region to seven categories of conventional weapons , while ignoring more advanced , more sophisticated or more lethal armaments , such as weapons of mass destruction , is an approach that is neither balanced nor comprehensive .  
Side by side with measures to introduce new information technologies , for example using the Internet and CD-ROMs to offer comprehensive information about the United Nations and its work to a wider audience , it was essential to continue supporting and using various traditional mass media such as printed matter , radio and television , bearing in mind the diversity and different level of development of countries around the world .  
Scientific , technical and cultural progress and the information revolution of the past decade had made the mass media an important instrument and a true reflection of current international realities in places , especially in developing countries , undergoing civil wars and conflicts .  
The threats posed by weapons of mass destruction are far from being extinguished , and the consequences of miscalculation or deliberate acts can be horrific , as we know from the terrorist activities of a cult group armed with nerve gas in Japan , biological and toxin weapons in Iraq and persistent reports and risks of nuclear smuggling .  
In subsequent statements , particularly , those entitled " political development policies " of the executive branches , emphasis was again placed on respecting human dignity and integrity ; ensuring civil rights and freedom ; defending public trials and the right to a lawyer ; fostering an independent mass media ; and fostering the principles of pluralism and diversity .  
They facilitate the spread of an economic model based on the principles of a market economy , while mass advertising and the global media help shape human aspirations and perceptions of social values .  
Furthermore , UNHCR emphasized that an essential condition for the prevention of involuntary mass movements is adequate political will on the part of the States directly concerned , and by the international community as a whole .  
Looking back at its record over the last 30 years , the Conference has developed an impressive set of international legal instruments that addresses in a comprehensive manner the security challenges posed by weapons of mass destruction .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
The challenge now is to combine this complex policy and organizational mix at the local , national and international levels into a critical mass that can lead to significant changes in human behaviour .  
The evaluations show that a major factor for achieving positive results is the availability of a critical mass of financial resources in order for the national programmes that the United Nations system is supporting to be effective .  
Threats to international peace and security have been posed not only by weapons of mass destruction but also by the excessive build-up of conventional weapons beyond a level considered legitimate for the purpose of self-defence .  
The reported mass killing of civilians by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds has continued since 8 August 1998 and has now found a serious and tragic dimension in Bamyan , a city largely populated by Shiite Muslims .  
The reported mass killing of civilians by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds has continued since 8 August 1998 and has now found a serious and tragic dimension in Bamyan , a city largely populated by Shiite Muslims .  
One of the key factors driving this dramatic growth in electronic commerce among the industrialized economies has been the achievement of a critical mass of online users .  
While welcoming also the notable progress made on instruments regarding weapons of mass destruction , Mali is deeply concerned about conventional weapons , which remain an area so far unexplored and not subject to international norms .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
While welcoming the Departments efforts and noting its enormous advances in the electronic information field , his delegation believed it necessary to point out that , because of the manifold economic and financial problems faced by countries with economies in transition , the traditional mass media were still the principal sources of information there .  
Strongly condemns summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings , enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , and calls upon the Government of Iraq to provide an accounting for the clean-out of prisons where there is credible evidence of mass summary executions ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial and arbitrary executions , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , forced relocation and denial of freedom of expression , assembly , association and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
By the Governments decision , the National Council for Womens Affairs , headed by a Cabinet member , the Minister for Health and Social Welfare , was established at the end of 1996 , and its operational by-laws were accordingly adopted . the Council is made up of MPs , officials of ministries concerned , representatives of womens non-governmental organizations , voluntary movements , mass organizations , owners of private companies , business and cooperative entities . 
In view of the fact that the two types of weapons of mass destruction of biological and chemical weapons have been comprehensively prohibited , there is no reason why nuclear weapons , which are of greater destructive force , should not be comprehensively banned and thoroughly destroyed .  
The programme budget for the biennium 19961997 , as approved by the General Assembly , stated that the efforts of the international community were still focused on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear ones , but were becoming increasingly concerned with the growth and proliferation of various types of conventional weapons ( A / 50 / 6 / Rev . 1,3 para .  2.81 ) .  The programme budget for the biennium 19981999 maintains the same approach .  
They pointed specifically to additional tasks and duties in the area of practical disarmament in the conventional field , the implementation of arms agreements regarding weapons of mass destruction , the facilitating of regional agreements and confidence-building measures and the current and future tasks associated with the implementation of international agreements on anti-personnel landmines ( A / 52 / 282 , para .  4 ) .  
Demands an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities which has led to further ethnic cleansing in the region , the genocide of Kosovars , their forced mass exodus and the destruction of their property with the aim of preventing their return , and also demands the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo ;  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
An important and recent concern has been the impact of transnational informational technology and mass media on peoples perceptions and expectations , in terms of their leading to or aggravating a conflict between expectations and realities , and between values and social roles , induced by the contrast between the cultures of rich countries and the pattern of opportunity in less well off societies .  
The Russian Federation and the Republic of Tajikistan shall contribute in every way possible to the preservation of the spiritual and cultural affinities of the two countries , deepen mutual ties in the fields of culture , science , public health services , education and information , promote the establishment of direct ties between organizations and people active in the areas of culture and art , and between research centres , educational institutions and the mass media .  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
They are guaranteed the right to establish and use their own mass media , cultural , educational , language and religious institutions , and to establish and foster unhindered relations and maintain peaceful contacts with co-nationals outside the Yugoslav borders , as well as the right to participate at the national , regional and local levels .  
Gravely concerned by such recent outrages as the murder of three human rights defenders and mass abduction from an aircraft , for which guerrilla groups were responsible , it calls on the guerrilla groups to respect norms of international humanitarian law , especially to refrain from killings and all attacks on the civilian population , indiscriminate massacres , hostage _ taking and the widespread use of anti _ personnel landmines , and to fulfil their own pledges not to recruit children .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .

The readiness demonstrated by the Arab States to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free from all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective in accordance with paragraph 5 of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East as well as paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) should not go unnoticed .  
In its resolution 1997 / 36 , of 28 August 1997 , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities authorized Ms . Clemencia Forero Ucros to prepare a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , for submission to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
The crisis in Kosovo has resulted in the mass forced displacement and deportation of hundreds of thousands of civilians , wholesale destruction of property and means of livelihood , wanton lawlessness and violence , thousands of documented killings , countless as-yet undocumented deaths , and immeasurable human suffering .  
Following the end of cold war , the United Nations has been called upon to take up new challenges and tasks as a result of the growing threat from the existence of large stockpiles of nuclear weapons , proposals for ballistic missile defences and the weaponization of outer space , the lack of progress in the field of disarmament , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the development and use of advanced and sophisticated conventional arms ;  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
It further asserts that it is mindful of the harmful environmental impact of weapons of mass destruction and that it has constantly urged that the environment should be protected , that it should not be damaged and that its effective contribution to the achievement of sustainable development should not be impaired .  
In fact , GPS services are expected to complete the transition from a stand-alone device system to a standard feature integrated into a variety of multifunctional products such as wireless personal communication devices , leading to a drastic reduction in prices . mass consumer market with an average selling price per receiving unit of about $ 100 . 264 bis . 
Ensure that United Nations missions aimed at peace-making , peacekeeping and peace-building include a mass media component that can disseminate information about international humanitarian law and human rights law , including peace education and children 's protection , while also giving objective information about the activities of the United Nations , and encourage authorized regional missions to include such a capacity .  
Recognizing that , owing to exceptional circumstances , Iraq was the subject of a unique sanctions regime established under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the Board nevertheless stressed the importance of ridding Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction ; of Iraqs full compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions ; and the grave regional and international consequences of Iraqs persistent non-compliance .  
The European Union has expressed support for the creation of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East , and emphasized the importance of additional protocols to safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency as an effective measure to prevent nuclear proliferation and foster mutual confidence .  
If not , the Security Council will impress upon the world public that the United States Government has abused the United Nations name to protect KLA terrorists , to cover up mass human rights violations and make possible the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and Metohija , thus creating a state which is both illegal and untenable .  
We can not but sound the alarm regarding information on new gross violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including reports of mass shootings , arrests and forcible relocations of hundreds of thousands of peaceful inhabitants of Afghanistan .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
She also condemned the grave human rights violations suffered by Serbs , Roma and others , expressing deep concern over the mass exodus of 150,000 Serbs from Kosovo , who join more than half a-million Serb refugees in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina enduring deprivation and an uncertain future in Serbia .  
The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) acts with its partners in the international community to assist in meeting the operational challenges of migration , advance understanding of migration issues , encourage social and economic development through migration , and uphold the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  IOM is involved in all phases of mass exoduses , providing technical and operational expertise in such areas as transportation , health , and other services for migrants .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
We know what these causes of conflict are : the huge gap between the living standards and incomes of different classes and nations ; the exponential increase in mass migration from poor to rich countries ; cultural difference and the conflicts and fanaticism it triggers ; criminal acts for the sake of glorifying or even creating a nation .  
So it is that the objective of collective security of States , associated with the new horizons opened up at the end of the cold war and serious progress towards general and complete disarmament which should involve first and foremost weapons of mass destruction will be expressed in the new terms of physical well-being and quality of life for citizens .  
Questions have arisen as to whether such exclusive arrangements with limited membership have been truly effective in achieving their stated purpose of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime , especially with regard to scientific and technological applications connected with advanced weapons as well as weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,

Any consideration of the Iraq sanctions regime should not be artificially forced or hurried if we are to achieve the twin goals of alleviating the grave humanitarian situation in Iraq and ensuring Iraqi compliance with the requirements in respect of its alleged remaining weapons of mass destruction .  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for those laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
However , to these categories there ought to be added a fourth : man-conceived disasters , including genocide , mass deportations , the use of death camps , ethnic cleansing , enforced or involuntary disappearances and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
At the 8 th meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee , the representative of the Russian Federation stated that the growing ability of terrorist groups to acquire sophisticated technologies and weapons of mass destruction made international terrorism a most serious problem calling for effective and concerted action by the international community .  
Meanwhile , short - and medium-term measures include confidence-building at the regional and global levels , transparency in the field of armaments , a steady reduction of military expenditures , the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the interim .  
We see , on the one hand , astounding developments in many fields of human endeavour and , on the other , national and international conflicts , resulting in mass destruction of human life and infrastructure as well as the almost irreversible compromising of the ecological system .  
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
At the same time , it is astonishing that a regime that has a dark record of developing , producing and stockpiling many inhumane kinds of weapons of mass destruction ventures to accuse a country that is among those in the Middle East that have joined the most basic international instruments in effect in the field of disarmament .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .

Of course , they would love to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction , stockpiles of fissile material and above all , many fewer conventional weapons , to enable them to live a peaceful life.Are we anywhere near these objectives and aspirations ?  
While obviously limited in payload mass , volume and power , but with very real and attractive advantages in terms of cost and response time , microsatellites complemented traditional large satellites by providing an alternative gap-filler for affordable quick-response or exploratory missions with both civil and military objectives .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
The experience is that these soft forms of tourism can be just as destructive as mass tourism , if they are not planned , developed and managed in a sustainable manner , so as to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the natural environment or the local sociocultural fabric , and that the local community is involved in all development and management phases .  
In resolution 34-175 , entitled Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
Yet practical results have been dismal as regard substantive measures directed toward the eventual and total elimination of nuclear weapons , which constitute the most destructive of such weapons of mass destruction .  
Taking into account the progress already made in international and subregional cooperation and coordination to make the most effective use of existing facilities , it should be noted that the major constraints for small island developing States are not so much the lack of scientific knowledge and technology as the shortage of financial and human resources more specifically , the lack of a critical mass of qualified scientists and associated institutions .  
If we truly want the Conference on Disarmament to live up to its responsibilities as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament and international security , let us focus our work here on halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons.Let us start today the negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty !  
Egypt regrets that all the efforts made to expand the scope of the United Nations Register have not yet yielded the required results since the Register remains limited to the annual notification of transfers of seven categories of conventional arms and continues to disregard other sophisticated and lethal types of conventional arms as well as weapons of mass destruction and advanced technologies with military applications .  
While respecting Algerias stages of political , economic , sociological and cultural development and acknowledging that popular support is necessary for any reform relating to womens rights , the Committee encourages the Government , non-governmental organizations , intellectuals and the mass media to do everything possible by means of publicity and public awareness campaigns to encourage more enlightened attitudes and accelerate womens emancipation .  
In order to foster coordination between the State and civil society , numerous mass events focusing on the issue of womens political and social participation and involving over 22 , 000 women ( parliaments , town meetings and social dialogues ) were held between 1995 and 1998 . These gave rise to permanent forums such as the womens regional round tables .  
Scientific and technological breakthroughs , growing interdependence , impressive development of standards of behaviour at the international level , and the emergence of a global consensus to prevent war and curb the perils of armaments and , particularly , weapons of mass destruction are indeed significant achievements of the twentieth century .  
It is no longer acceptable or even practical to divide the international community into two distinct groupings : one living behind the walls of fortresses of alliances and weapons of mass destruction , while the security concerns of others are completely neglected as they are depicted as the source of possible threat and worthy of containment and deprivation . 
Any integral pallet base forming part of a large packaging or any detachable pallet shall be suitable for mechanical handling with the large packaging filled to its maximum permissible gross mass .  
Any integral pallet base forming part of a large packaging or any detachable pallet shall be suitable for mechanical handling with the large packaging filled to its maximum permissible gross mass .  
Lithium content means the mass of lithium in the anode of a lithium metal or lithium alloy cell , which for a primary cell is measured when the cell is in an undischarged state and for a rechargeable cell is measured when the cell is fully charged , except that in the case of a lithium-ion cell the lithium content is measured in terms of equivalent lithium content , which in grams is calculated to be 0.3 times the rated capacity in ampere-hours .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for these laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo , affecting ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo personnel and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
The two sides consider that the creation , in violation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 , of a national anti-ballistic-missile defence system by one of the States which signed that Treaty will have a destructive effect on strategic stability and on the entire structure of key international agreements relating to disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery , and will mar prospects for achieving further progress in these directions .  
In the broad spectrum of other challenges , such as global epidemics , regional conflicts , nationalist hatred , religious violence and terrorism , one of the very real dangers to human survival still emanates from the existence of weapons of mass destruction .  
In the Declaration , we also expressed our intention to carry out all the efforts required to ensure the Treatys full and universal implementation in order to promote the final objective , a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
This is a mass organization , whose main functions are to help take care of the material and spiritual life of older persons and to engage them in the political , social and cultural activities of the local community .  
The independent expert reported to the Commission at its previous session on the preliminary assessment by a team of forensic experts sent by OHCHR of mass graves in the vicinity of Hargeisa , in northwest Somalia ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 103 / Add . 1 ) .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
While weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons , continue to be of primary concern , the international community has expressed increasing concern about the proliferation of conventional weapons , especially small arms and light weapons .  
It is generally recognized that the modern world is still characterized by the persistence of armed conflicts , which continue to cause human losses and mass violations of human rights , as well as economic , social and cultural devastation .  
Our national and regional security is best enhanced through the development of an international security system and through the removal of the threat to peace posed by weapons of mass destruction and the excessive accumulation of conventional weapons .  
Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .  
The consequences of war , acts of genocide , armed conflicts , family violence , international terrorism , organized crime , and trafficking in humans and drugs , as well as weapons of mass destruction and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , have devastating consequences for children and a profound impact on their lives and their communities .  
The Declaration emphasizes the important role of international cooperation for , and the valuable work of individuals , groups and associations in contributing to , the effective elimination of all violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of peoples and individuals , including in relation to mass , flagrant or systematic violations of human rights .  
Governments , relevant United Nations agencies , Bretton Woods institutions and civil society organizations ( including unions , the private sector , mass media and universities ) should all be actively involved in identifying the most effective ways to achieve sustainable social outcomes for children .  
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .  
The reply describes emergency humanitarian assistance for the displaced population ; direct emergency humanitarian assistance for cases of mass displacement ; non-food aid for mass displacements ; individual and family humanitarian assistance ; and a scheme of independently-managed humanitarian assistance which is not confined to emergency humanitarian support but involves major investments to help restore the social and economic stability of the displaced population .  
The Ministerial Council welcomed the historic outcome of the referendum on the Charter of National Action in Bahrain , which expressed national cohesion as well as popular support for and mass approval of all the worthy measures and policies of His Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa , Amir of Bahrain , thus bolstering the process of modernization and development and the building of a bright future for the State of Bahrain and the advancement of its citizens .  
Mr . President , I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Egypts total commitment to work earnestly and diligently towards the achievement of the objectives of general and complete disarmament , which require maintenance of the minimum defence requirements and the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , in accordance with the priorities adopted by the international community at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
Urge the United Nations , other appropriate international and regional organizations and States to redress the marginalization of Africas contribution to world history and civilization by developing and implementing a specific and comprehensive programme of research , education and mass communication to widely disseminate the truth about Africas seminal and valuable contribution to humanity ;  
The parliamentarians of the Republic of Belarus appeal to State parliaments and Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , business , financial , scientific and religious circles , social movements and funds , representatives of the mass media , their compatriots and all peoples of goodwill not to forget that the people of Belarus have been living in an environmental disaster area for many decades and need active assistance from the world community . 
The international community , during the course of last year and still in the year 2001 , witnessed how the Pakistan military junta played host to public mass gatherings of terrorist networks of the region and the extremist religious groups of Pakistan on its soil , who clearly and explicitly proclaimed their agenda and expressed intentions for expanding their realm of influence in the region through setting up extremist and radical regimes in countries of the region .  
Its main purpose is to move ahead and explore other priority areas touched upon in the earlier documents prepared by the Special Rapporteur , namely the problem of definition and of the actors involved in the exercise or use of terrorist activity , the development of new forms of terrorism and the probability of mass destruction terrorism and , finally , a number of issues associated with the consequences of terrorism for human rights .  
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
We firmly believe that the Final Document of the General Assemblys special session devoted to disarmament in 1978 rightly stated that the main priority should be granted to nuclear disarmament and weapons of mass destruction , and , afterward , conventional weapons .  
While warm thanks were due to the Government of Germany for its growing understanding of the needs of the UNFCCC secretariat and to the City of Bonn for its unfailing hospitality , he believed that the over-all United Nations presence in Bonn had not yet reached the critical mass of activity that would provide an attractive base for career development and allow United Nations institutions to recruit , motivate and retain competent staff .  
Where gaps or deficiencies are identified or confirmed during the exercise , UNDP will seek answers to the question of how to establish new practices that will serve to establish the critical mass of information required for future reports and to carry out a rigorous , comprehensive evaluative assessment of UNDP performance .  
Applying transparency in the Middle East region to seven categories of conventional weapons while ignoring more advanced , more sophisticated or more lethal armaments , such as weapons of mass destruction and , in particular , nuclear weapons , is an approach that is neither balanced nor comprehensive .  
At its fifty-seventh session , in April 2001 , the Commission on Human Rights adopted , without a vote , resolution 2001 / 13 on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan , in which it strongly condemned the mass killings and systematic human rights violations against civilians and persons deprived of their liberty , for reasons related to the armed conflict , resulting in the massive , forced displacement of the civilian population .  
Everyone is aware of the critical role of the mass media in shaping public opinion on any question , be it domestic or international , and of its major responsibility to observe impartiality and complete objectivity in covering events such as those that took place in the United States recently .  
Therefore , besides the legal instruments prohibiting weapons of mass destruction , it is vitally important today for the international community to promote closer cooperation to upgrade the physical protection of nuclear material , combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and enhance the protection and control of nuclear facilities against acts of terrorism and sabotage .  
Although weapons of mass destruction are the most threatening of weapons to our societies , in circumstances of civil war and armed conflicts small arms and light weapons have proved to be equally deadly and brutal .  
In the new millennium , other priorities include eliminating the so-called tactical nuclear weapons ; banning fissile materials for weapons purposes ; arresting the acquisition of advanced weapons of mass destruction ; maintaining the credibility of the non-proliferation regime ; and concluding an international convention against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear-weapon States .  
For more than 50 years now , we have struggled to find ways to achieve that measure of global political coherence required to survive the grave risks posed by weapons of mass destruction , thermonuclear bombs foremost among them , whose blasts are thousands of times more powerful than those of 11 September arsenals that could lead to human extinction .  
In the view of my Government , it is especially necessary to undertake effective and substantial multilateral efforts , to consolidate existing instruments against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to set up universally verifiable and transparent arms control and disarmament regimes . 
Moreover , the international community must take action to bolster existing mechanisms and instruments and to set out a specific timetable for the successive stages of general disarmament and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction nuclear , chemical and biological in particular .  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
The United Arab Emirates , which joined the NPT , the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) and the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) , in order to reinforce its international position , believes that establishing zones free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is the key to establishing balances in international and regional strategic relations .  
It further urged the United Nations to redress the marginalization of Africas contribution to world history and civilization by developing and implementing a specific and comprehensive programme of research , education and mass communication to disseminate widely a balanced and objective presentation of Africas seminal and valuable contribution to humanity .  
Notwithstanding the fresh hopes for a safer environment brought about by the end of the cold war , the world has experienced a proliferation of regional conflicts and armed hostilities , and has witnessed a trend towards the spread and destabilizing accumulation of sophisticated weapons systems , including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .
