Chen Guo was getting mature in her musical performance skills , but she was taken by Li Hongzhi as a tool and sacrifice .  This is indeed a very painful consequence that makes people sad .  
Through these chats about normal , everyday matters , we found that before becoming obsessed with " Falungong , " many female members had been good employees at work , as well as good mothers , wives and daughters at home ; it was only after being poisoned by Li Hongzhi that they became lost and estranged from their moral sense , sensibilities and affections , and committed some illegal acts .  
The BA considered that the prolonged close-ups on the sexual characteristic of a woman was exploitative , offensive to the average viewer and denigrating to the female gender .

The female side also saw vivid and fine performances . Ying-ying ( lyrical soprano ) was cast as a refined , proper young woman , whose heart was quick to separate those she loved from those she detested . Her wise maid Hung Niang ( coloratura soprano ) let no obstacles daunt her in the pursuit of what was right , while Ts'ui 's mother ( mezzo soprano ) , caught between obligation to her husband and gratitude to Chang Sheng , found her emotions conflicted , uncertain as to how to solve this terrible dilemma .  
As part of this way of thinking , Chinese people strive to maintain a balance within the individual between the forces of yin and yang ( the dual principles of male and female , or positive and negative ) , which have influenced the concepts of hot and cold in Chinese food and medicine .  
The prime meaning of the word kan or " stem " is a strong and powerful tree trunk , representing the Yang or male principle ; the word chih or " branch " originally meant a weak and tender twig , thus representing the Yin or female principle .  
Firstly , the Yin &amp; Yang principles described in the I-ching ( Classic of Changes ) can indicate many polarities such as the sun &amp; moon , day &amp; night , light &amp; dark , motion &amp; rest , internal &amp; external , cold &amp; heat , hard &amp; soft , and male &amp; female .  
In traditional Chinese ghost stories the principal character is often a fetchingly lovely female ghost . This no doubt heightens the tension of the story , but there is also a good reason behind it - - unmarried women who die young have no male progeny to carry out ancestral worship within their spouse 's family , neither can they be accommodated in their own family 's ancestral spirit tablet , which means their fate is more liable than most to be that of a wandering ghost .  
" One male patient received a heart from a female donor , and was worried he would turn into a woman , " recalls Dr . Chu with a smile .

The male and female black eagle are completely identical in their external physical features , but through many years of observation , she became able to distinguish the male and female of a pair of black eagles flying together , from their attitude and position .  
One example can be found in the Taiwan television serial " Empress of an Age , " where aside from portraying the Empress Wu as a strong female in the traditional mold , the writers also see fit to credit her success to the support of two capable men . Not even a TV series which exalts the most legendary female figure in Chinese history can escape the confines of maleoriented thinking .  
In the neighborhood of Wu Tzu-tien ( a tree named for the only female emperor in Chinese history ) , there is a small stretch of Taiwan sassafras growing . The supple leaves of this plant are a favorite food for Papilio xuthus butterflies , and if your luck is running good you 'll be able to see these two protected species , one plant , one animal , side-by-side .  
Most of English-language radio station ICRT 's listening audience are students . David Wang , host of " The Youth Nightline , " believes that what concerns young people are passing exams , careers , interpersonal communication and male / female relations . But because this material gets mulled over a lot , " we have to interject topics from the news too . " In fact , he believes that such controversial and timely issues as campus violence and sex education are very well-received .  
The notion of female chastity began to be reinforced . Previously it had been common for widows to remarry , but from the Song onwards remarriage was seen as " unchaste , " and was not tolerated by the society of the time . Stories such as " The widow cutting off her arm " ( after it had been accidentally touched by a man ) and " An injured breast left untreated " ( because exposure to the doctor 's gaze would have been worse than death ) were taken as models and ideals and widely promoted .

Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors .

An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
It stated that in many Asian countries , including Taiwan , attitudes of male superiority are deeply rooted , particularly in regions socially influenced by Confucianism and by the traditional notion that " there are three ways to be unfilial , and the worst is to be without issue . " In these societies , the report said , there are frequent cases of female infanticide , and of female fetuses being aborted after their sex is determined by medical tests .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
In fact the exact ratio of male to female births is not what is important . Scholars believe that a question even more worth discussing ought to be why , in a society which calls itself modern and prides itself on having created an economic miracle , the phenomenon of using prenatal diagnostic testing to determine fetal gender and then aborting female fetuses should exist at all . For if we attack mainland China 's one-child policy for producing infanticide , how is this practice different from what happens on the mainland ?  
Huang explains that turtle shell 's effects should n't be so narrowly defined . Rather it should be regarded as increasing general vitality , just as developing skills in waidan kung fu can develop one 's qi . And so whether one suffers from a sore back , nagging sore throat , or weak blood and qi ; whether one is male or female , old or young ; there are appropriate prescriptions containing turtle shell that vary according to age and condition .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types . Years ago Mei Lanfang combined traits of the qingyi ( leading female ) and huadan ( vivacious female ) roles to create a new type of role , the huashan , that combines features of both .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital .

Look back at all the various ghosts-the male ghost who fears that no one will look after him , the female phantom trapped in the pain of emotional hurt and revenge , the old man unable to rest in peace in a tomb full of water , and the aggrieved " substitute seeking " ghost looking everywhere for someone to stand in for it-and you will notice something interesting : The appearance of ghosts reflects the fact that life is too short ; the tragedies of ghosts represent the persistent attachment to the mundane world .  
Other topics include " loving a younger man " - is it shameful for a female student to become involved with a boy who is her academic junior ? - and , how to define " best friends of the opposite sex ? " The true stories that emerge through these discussions touch on the personal concerns of the participants .  
The female prosecutors tend to be a bit more cautious in these matters , paying careful attention to legal and procedural demands . Although this is only proper in respecting human rights , still the police often feel frustrated as a result .  
Of course , men and women are different . Just as cases involving guns or narcotics are commonly assigned to male prosecutors , currently many cases of " undermining public morality , " such as adultery , rape , prostitution , and violent sexual offenses , have been assigned to women . In this way , female victims are n't intimidated by a male prosecutor , or embarrassed to describe what happened in detail . It also prevents female victims from unintentionally being hurt more .  
It was discovered that in maledominated jobs-the military and police , construction workers , machinists-men use various roundabout methods to " mark their territory .

It even happens that women scholars doing field research or female students supporting labor rights may find themselves in dangerous situations in such environments .  
The millennial tradition of patrilineal filiation is being recognized by women 's groups as the source of two thousand years of Chinese preferential gender treatment , " valuing the male and devaluing the female , " and " ennobling the male and debasing the female .

Chinese have always encouraged those whose marriages are in trouble to stay together . Nevertheless , while divorce is certainly not desirable , it is the main way to bring unfortunate marriages to an end . It is an essential form of protection for both sexes . The problem is , when a marriage hits the rocks , can the male and female players agree to cut the knot as smoothly as they tied it ?  
Shunza 's music is classic US black music , ranging from rock and jazz to R &amp; B . A style that Taiwan 's female singers have rarely tried in the past has taken the market by storm , and her musical style and moving voice have been the subject of intense discussion on the Internet .  
Shunza , who was born in Beijing , grew up in the US and studied music in Switzerland , sings of the desire to return home after years of wandering , sentiments which have won her a following in the ranks of students living away from home . She has also touched upon lust , an area that female Taiwanese singers rarely do , with the lyrics " I just ca n't get enough of you . " She also sings that the world is so boring that even the toys protest .

Mr . Pavavalung is representative of aboriginal artists ; his favored areas include carving , ceramic work and creating installations . The sculpture acquired by the museum is entitled Divining Before a Hunting Adventure , and depicts the divination ritual conducted by a female shaman for the hunters prior to their adventure .  
Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .

She takes for example feminist issues , about which she is particularly concerned . Twenty years ago , she wrote a TV serial that overturned the tradition that the female lead had to be chaste , unmarried , and dependent on men ; instead her female lead was a middle-aged divorcee with children and a relationship with a younger man . Society was shocked from top to bottom .  
Chinese society is male dominated , and women are mostly regarded as having a subsidiary role . In this kind of unfair situation , an upstanding man should cherish and respect women all the more . A considerate attitude can be expressed in little things . For instance , when you see that a hair has fallen onto a female friend 's shoulder , you should lightly pick it off for her , and throw it away or put it in your pocket .  
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan-ju made an acute observation about Yeh : Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .  
Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media . When a female postal worker complained of discriminatory testing , and a young man suffered constant harassment by tax authorities after his ID card was used for someone else 's tax file , Chang took their cases to administrative authorities for the fair treatment they deserved . In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .

Luantan by day . . . For a long time , traditional Chinese moral concepts effectively banned females from performing in the often-suggestive three-part tea-picking opera , so the female roles used to be played in most cases by male performers . That did not change in any major way until the 1940s when a group of child stars-including Cheng Jung-hsing 's grandmother ( Cheng Mei-mei ) and Ah Yu-tan-broke the taboo .

For about five days the female can be seen shuttling back and forth , carrying in her beak dry twigs and pine needles from which she constructs the nest . Once the structure is stable she gathers dry leaves to make a soft , comfortable layer on top . Finally , she lifts up her tail and plumps herself down on her bottom , moving round in a circle , to make the nest dense and firm . The finished nest is shaped like a bowl hanging below the branch .  
In the years that followed Lan taught himself the historian 's craft and collected a rich store of materials which , as he explains , were the origin of his latest book : " I had collected a wealth of materials waiting to be classified and arranged , but the stories of these five women provided me with the most complete source for shedding light on the true face of the female victims of the White Terror .

Li sets her stories in her hometown of Lukang , here appearing as the city of Lu , about which vengeful female spirits have entrenched themselves , one each to the north , south , east , and west , and another in its center .

Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .  
Sixteen demographic indicators are given : total populations for males , females and both sexes combined ; population density ; female population aged 15-49 ; population under age 15 ; population aged 15-64 ; population aged 65 or over ; average annual rate of population growth ; crude birth and death rates ; total fertility rate ; life expectancies at birth for males , females and both sexes combined ; and infant mortality rate .  
Members requested detailed statistical data in the subsequent report and asked whether the current legislation was not discriminatory in that it made a distinction between female prostitutes and their male clients .  
The list of issues it prepared in considering States parties ' reports always included questions concerning the participation of women in political , economic , social and cultural life and male and female enrolment in schools and universities .  
All parties involved in the development process , including academic institutions , non-governmental organizations and grass-roots and women 's groups , should mobilize to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes directed towards the poorest and most disadvantaged groups of women , such as rural and indigenous women , female heads of households , young women and older women , refugees and migrant women and women with disabilities .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
[ Create , fund , and improve ] or develop the training of judicial , legal , medical , social , educational and police and immigration personnel , as appropriate , in order to avoid the abuse of power leading to violence against women and sensitize such personnel to the nature of gender-based acts and threats of violence so that fair treatment of female victims can be assured ;  
These included : empowerment of women as an overall concept ; mass media ; statistics and indicators on gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development : water , waste management and sanitation ; renewable energy ; and issues related to different groups of female population such as the ageing , displaced ; refugees and migrants .  50 .  The Board decided that INSTRAW should introduce the following in its new programme , among other subjects :  
The guidelines suggest numerous preventive measures that may be taken such as practical improvements in camp organization , location and design ; human resources management measures including the hiring of more female staff ; measures aimed at encouraging the host Government to take effective legal and other action ; and preventive measures involving education and training .  
[ They are often subjected to [ various forms of ] sexual and economic exploitation , [ paedophilia , prostitution , forced prostitution and trafficking in human organs and tissues ] , violence and harmful practices such as [ prenatal sex selection foeticide ] infanticide , incest , female genital mutilation and [ forced ] early marriage . ] "  Paragraph 44 , last sentence .  
" Create , improve or develop , as appropriate , and fund training programmes for judicial , legal , medical , social , educational , police and immigration personnel , in order to avoid the abuse of power leading to violence against women and sensitize such personnel to the nature of gender-based acts and threats of violence so that fair treatment of female victims can be assured " .  
Intensify and coordinate international support for education and health programmes based on respect for human dignity and focused on the protection of all women and children , especially against exploitation , trafficking and harmful practices , such as child prostitution , female genital mutilation and child marriages . "  
Specific measures include the regulation of recruitment agencies ; legal , social and educational outreach to migrant women ; trained female police officers and protection from male officers ; training for embassy personnel ; enforcement of national labour standards for all workers that conform to international guidelines ; better enforcement of existing laws ; involvement of trade unions ; and implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions and reporting mandates .  
Enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence .  Strategic objective L . 8 .  Educate the girl child about social ,  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .

The Committee acknowledged the State party 's initiatives to provide bilingual education but expressed its concern at the inadequacy of those initiatives , which posed a major obstacle to women 's access to social and economic opportunities , since a large percentage of the female population spoke only Guaran , the predominant aboriginal language .  
The Committee noted with regret that the economic constraints resulting from the transition process were having a negative impact on women 's employment and health ; female unemployment was increasing and the quality of social services provided to women was deteriorating .  NULLIn addition , the state of health of the female population was unsatisfactory when judged by international standards .  
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
Peace is built through ordinary coexistence , with all Guatemalans , male or female , striving daily to make a living and to help their families get ahead , seeking out better opportunities while enduring hardships in a country with so many limitations and so much distrust . 
The Committee acknowledged the State party 's initiatives to provide bilingual education but expressed its concern at the inadequacy of those initiatives , which posed a major obstacle to women 's access to social and economic opportunities , since a large percentage of the female population spoke only Guarani , the predominant aboriginal language .

On the subject of participation by women in political life , she stated that female candidates were more successful in contests at the local level , where they were known personally to voters , although the proportion of women elected to municipal assemblies had fallen from approximately 30 per cent in the 1980s to only 16 per cent in 1990 . 
In that resolution , the Assembly dealt with the matter from a criminological perspective , inviting Member States to adopt specific measures to make the crime prevention and criminal justice system more responsive to domestic violence , for example , by enacting criminal law and procedure and improving the situation and the fair treatment of the female victim .  
Other elements identified as important , especially as regards sex crime , were : the adoption of adequate legislation ; the setting-up of special offices at police stations with separate facilities ; the provision of assistance and especially trained practitioners to handle female victimization ; conducting specialized , multifaceted training courses ; setting up specialized police units ; establishing national reference centres to collect and analyse data and effectively monitor , prevent and suppress the phenomenon ; education ; coordination ; and information dissemination .  
50 To this definition , the Platform for Action additionally includes the violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , in particular , murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; forced sterilization and forced abortion , coercive / forced use of contraceptives , female infanticide and prenatal sex selection .  
Conduct thematic studies to evaluate poverty alleviation strategies , especially with reference to women workers in the informal sector - on such themes as poverty , household food security and gender , focusing on the feminization of poverty as expressed in food insecurity ; conduct studies with respect to adapting successful credit systems in different socio-cultural areas , with particular emphasis on the needs of poor rural women , and to integrating information on credit systems into non-formal education ; undertake case-studies on the role of female entrepreneurs in the least developed countries ;  
Major areas for policy , programme and project intervention will include nutrition ; the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity ; comprehensive reproductive health , including fertility regulation and sexual health , maternal health and safe motherhood , sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS ; violence against women and girls as a public health issue ; female genital mutilation ; occupational health ; and increasing the use of gender-based indicators and of national legislation to promote women 's health .  
Conduct research on the effects of the internationalization and globalization of economies , including technological change , on men 's and women 's employment , including changing international work patterns , and publish the findings for use in policy formulation and advocacy ; continue research on occupational segregation and on unequal pay for men and women ; assess the gender dimension of structural adjustment through country studies ; document the impact of policy reforms on women , based on household surveys ; conduct case-studies on the role and contribution of female entrepreneurs in the least developed countries ;  
Their lower status and the gender roles assigned by society result in unmet needs which are experienced both by drug-using women and female partners of male drug abusers in various social , cultural and economic environments .  Furthermore , it has been found that women are more likely than men to become infected with HIV through both sexual transmission and intravenous injection .  
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate - the appropriate age group to be determined in each country - to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;  
This applies to female employees as well , and legislation is in force preventing discrimination against women based on maternal duties , stipulating that the duration of creditable service time must include the time spent in child care , equivalent in length to maternity leave or extended maternity leave ( as specified by relevant legislation ) , as well as time spent in all-day care for a child with severely impaired health , as regulated by specific legislation ( maximum six years of the sum of such creditable times ) .  
Partial differences between the wages of male and female employees may be derived from the fact that chapter 150 , paragraph 2 , of the Labour Code forbids women to perform work considered physically unsuitable for women or harmful to them , mainly work executed in unsuitable or noxious conditions potentially threatening maternity .  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often results in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;

The fastest promotions were not always linked to competence and efficiency : recent times had witnessed a drastic curtailment of the promotions of male staff members as they had increasingly come up against stiff female competition buttressed by comprehensive preferential measures .  
The term " rape " was not defined , and although it was possible to adapt the term " rape " to sociological realities , that is to say to take account of present-day sexual practices , there was a reluctance to do so ; in most cases the only act characterized as rape was that ultimate violation of the person which is likely to result in pregnancy .  [ 66 ] Oral and anal penetrations forced on a person , whether male or female , were , at most , punishable as indecent assaults .  
In order to provide enterprises with incentives to adopt innovative measures to promote female employment , a special award was established in 1993 at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour and Employment to reward those enterprises which have taken action to increase the participation of women in the labour force , improve the quality of female employment , develop their potential , including through the strengthening of programmes to provide education and vocational training , and eliminate or counteract the negative consequences in women 's work .  
In a judgement rendered on 21 April 1982 , the Supreme Court of Justice , ruling on appeal , declared void a provision on bank employees ' labour contracts which gave married male employees the unreserved right to a domestic subsidy , while allowing the subsidy to married female employees only under severely restricted conditions . 
The scope for female employment has been rapidly expanded by technological change , increasing concentration of employment in service industries , increased flexibility of work times and availability of part-time work , changing social attitudes towards female employment , and improved provision of childcare .  
The latter includes : ( i ) general actions related to shelter , services and settlement-wide issues ; ( ii ) actions for families in especially difficult circumstances ( including those in critical housing conditions , the homeless , female headed households and evicted families ) ; and ( iii ) specific actions for children ( mainly children in especially difficult circumstances ) .  
The right of disabled children to a full and decent life and to special care and the rights to abolition of traditional practices which are prejudicial to the health of children , such as early marriage , female genital mutilation , denial of equal sustenance and inheritance for girls are also highly relevant in the context of HIV / AIDS .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them in the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impedes their upward mobility and further reinforces discrimination against women in the labour market .  
The Committee was also concerned that the country had not made much real progress in implementing the Convention and that , despite its efforts , it had yet to respond effectively to problems such as domestic violence , prostitution , early pregnancy , female illiteracy , discrimination in the workplace in terms of how much women were paid , the high percentage of women receiving less than the minimum wage , the elimination of stereotypes , and the changes that needed to be made in the country 's legal system , which reinforced existing stereotypes .  
The Committee remains concerned at prevailing traditional attitudes and harmful practices , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies , and at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes against vulnerable groups of children , such as the girl child , disabled children , children born out of wedlock and children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans .  
Such measures would promote change in persisting negative attitudes towards children , particularly girls , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans , and contribute to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health and well-being of children , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies .  
Measures that have been adopted by some political parties include setting aside for women a certain minimum number or percentage of positions on their executive bodies , ensuring that there is a balance between the number of male and female candidates nominated for election , and ensuring that women are not consistently assigned to less favourable constituencies or to the least advantageous positions on a party list .  
Such women benefited from a number of special measures , such as the provision of safe shelter ; counselling by professional social workers ; the possibility of requesting that the administrative procedures in their case should be carried out by a female official of the Ministry of Justice and that a female interpreter should be provided ; language courses scheduled so as to be compatible with family life ; and specialized services for women refugees who obtained residence permits .  
The Platform for Action defines violence against women as including Physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , including battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry _ related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non _ spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ( para .  113 ) .  
In its concluding comments concerning the combined initial , second and third periodic reports of Ethiopia ( A / 51 / 38 , fifteenth session ) , the Committee expressed great concern with respect to the widespread practice of female genital mutilation , as well as the incidence of violence against women and girls and the insufficiency of measures to eradicate it .  
In order to increase the representation of women at the Professional level , FAO developed strategies to identify suitable female candidates and established a roster of international experts working in the area of women in development to be considered for future vacancies .  
In Mozambique a major part of this initiative has involved a radio drama series in which Mozambican actors act out a lively series of plots conveying messages such as the importance of staying in school , how to deal with sexual harassment , AIDS-awareness , and covering delicate issues such as female genital mutilation , early marriages , and the domestic workload of girls .  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
Similarly , although the Civil Service Regulations make no distinction between the salaries , working hours and period of employment of male and female workers , they fail to provide adequate support for working women , particularly since the pension payable to a woman is not inherited by her family in the event of her death .  Moreover , the social security and health insurance of a working woman do not include her husband and children unless it is confirmed that they are in need and proven that the female employee is directly responsible for their maintenance .  
In order to take effective legislative and political measures to ensure equality between women and men , Bulgaria had adopted a national plan of action in 1996 aimed at protecting the human rights of women , improving their economic and social status , eradicating female poverty , promoting the participation of women in decision-making , improving the health of women and eliminating all forms of violence against women . 
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
At the internal level , the relation between the Government and its citizens is based , as I said before , on constitutional legitimacy ; on equality among all citizens , whether male or female ; on equality in rights and obligations of men and women alike ; on the freedom of individuals and groups ; on the freedom of association to parties , trade unions and civilian community organizations ; on freedom of the press ; and on the protection of human rights .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
There should also be special attention given to promoting social protection for vulnerable or marginalized groups of women workers , especially international female migrant workers , women in transition economies adversely affected by economic reforms and long-term unemployed older women workers .  
Where women have demonstrated a clear preference for those parties and candidates that are gender-sensitive and supportive of women 's interests , especially with regard to reproductive rights , social services , participation in decision-making , elimination of violence against women and environmental protection , close parliamentary or presidential contests have been influenced or the outcome determined by the female voters and their preferences .  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
UNFPA is the lead agency for integration of reproductive health care , which includes sexual health and family planning , maternal and neonatal care , prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections , sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , and elimination of harmful practices , including female genital mutilation ( FGM ) and violence against women .  
They were urged to eliminate negative cultural practices and attitudes against girls and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against girls and the root causes of son preference , which resulted in harmful and unethical practices , inter alia , by enacting and enforcing legislation protecting girls from violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse and exploitation . 
Furthermore , under the special General Initiative Fund for Refugee Women , project support is being provided for the training of 100 traditional birth attendants in seven districts of Afghanistan ; for improving the reproductive health of refugee women in Malawi , which includes family planning advisory services , education on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS prevention and the addressing of cultural constraints and male attitudes to reproductive health care ; and for an educational video on female genital mutilation in Eritrea and related reproductive health care .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .

The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them into the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impeded their upward mobility and further reinforced discrimination against women in the labour market .  
On the subject of refugee status being granted to women fleeing female genital mutilation as mentioned by the Special Rapporteur in her final report , note should be taken with satisfaction of the initiative taken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in September 1996 when it assembled the representatives of 16 Western countries in Geneva to draw the attention of the authorities responsible for awarding refugee status to the problems specific to women and which differ from the generally recognized forms of political persecution .  
However , it was regrettable that no reference was made to the situation of female migrant workers , who suffered multiple discrimination based on sex and national or ethnic origin and very often lacked adequate legal status in the host countries .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .  
There were fewer women than men in the labour force , mainly because many women were engaged in child rearing , and much of the unpaid female work in the agricultural sector was not generally recorded as economic activity .  
The legislative position supported by the Government conforms with advice from the World Health Organization that legislation should set an unequivocal standard that all forms of female genital mutilation are inappropriate .  
Urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
While welcoming the State party 's innovative measures , both legal and educational , to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices affecting the health of girls , the Committee expresses its concern at the limited impact of these measures .  
at the national level , there are cases of discrimination against unmarried female pupils and teachers who , because of pregnancy , are expelled from private religious schools or , exceptionally , from State educational institutions on the ground that they may have a bad influence on other pupils .  
The European Union stressed the need to prohibit female genital mutilation , and supported the practical steps taken by Governments , intergovernmental bodies , non-governmental organizations , community organizations and religious institutions to eliminate such practices through , inter alia , efforts to change societal attitudes by raising awareness of the harmful effects of such practices .  
Among such practices were female genital circumcision , which also posed grave health risks for females ; arranged marriages without consent and contracted against personal will ; sexual harassment , which had become widespread ; force-feeding ; and removal of children from their mother at an early age .  
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate the appropriate age group to be determined in each country to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;  
Strongly condemns physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , which encompasses , but is not limited to , battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry-related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ;

The Special Rapporteur was very impressed with the far-reaching and exemplary work undertaken by the government-sponsored Sudan National Committee on Traditional Practices ( SNCTP ) , officially established in 1988 with the objective of eradicating harmful practices endangering the health of women and children , chief among them female genital mutilation ( FGM ) . 
She had also stressed the need to take into account the rapid growth of the female labour force in developing countries and to protect workers in the informal sector , most of whom were women , and had argued that the Governments of developing countries should move slowly in adopting policies for economic liberalization , which reduced the demand for unskilled female workers .  
Governments should strive to ensure that by 2015 all primary health-care and family-planning facilities are able to provide , directly or through referral , the widest achievable range of safe and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods ; essential obstetric care ; prevention and management of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , and barrier methods ( such as male and female condoms and microbicides if available ) to prevent infection .

The Philippine delegation fully supports the various measures under the section on international migration which are directed at protecting and improving the conditions of migrant workers , particularly female migrant workers , who are easily exploited and harassed .  
Indeed , the national plan for comprehensive health care for adolescents and young people recognizes that male and female teenagers are capable within the law of taking informed and responsible decisions about their sexuality and reproduction , and that for them to do so they must be provided with suitable guidance and accessible services just for them .  
Other women-based policies since put in place deal with the elimination of female genital mutilation ; adolescent health ; legal reforms to eliminate domestic violence and to raise the minimum age for marriage to 18 years ; and the development of a strategic framework for the implementation of adolescent reproductive health , among others .  
The reproductive health situation is also very poor , with high-risk programmes , high maternal mortality rates , a high rate of infant and child deaths , high fertility rates , a low contraceptive prevalence rate , a high proportion of unmet reproductive health needs , and the existence of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation . 
The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
It was in the proper understanding of the important role of women in the development process and of their right to physical integrity that the Burkina Faso Government established a national committee to combat all forms of discrimination against women and adopted a law prohibiting and punishing female genital mutilation .  
This plan revolves around seven priority areas : first , improvement of the living conditions of women ; second , improvement of the legal status of women ; third , development of female human resources in all the development sectors ; fourth , access by women to effective decision-making ; fifth , promotion and protection of the girl child ; sixth , combatting violence against women ; and seventh , improvement of the institutional framework .  
When one studies traditional practices , in particular female genital mutilation , it must first be noted that they are rooted in a whole set of beliefs , values , cultural and social behaviour patterns governing the lives of the societies concerned .  
The programme it drew up is based on consciousness _ raising , the adoption of a common law against the practice , institutional capacity _ building in the national committees , which should , it is said , be attached to the departments in charge of the campaign against female genital mutilation , the conversion of female excisionists , and the formulation of a media plan .  
On that basis , the majority of Libyan legislative acts promulgated after the Great Revolution of 1 September are directed at all citizens , irrespective of gender ; they prescribe numerous rights to be enjoyed in all fields , without distinction between men and women , in so far as they are fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , both male and female .  
Most Libyan legislative acts are directed at all citizens , irrespective of their sex , and prescribe the body of rights which they enjoy in the political , functional , economic , social , cultural , health and educational fields , without discrimination between men and women , being fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , whether male or female .  
In accordance with the objective of health for all , the State spent tremendous sums of money on the health sector with a view to providing a health service for every male and female citizen , without distinction , and developing health services , medicines and free treatment in line with the latest international scientific developments and in quantities and qualities proportionate to the needs of all citizens .  
If providing food to poor families in all parts of the country is given equal value in a financially expensive programme of food security , the female children in backward villages may continue to be deprived , if social reforms are not pursued effectively . most vulnerable . 
While welcoming the State party 's efforts to adopt measures , both legal and educational , to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices affecting the health of children , the Committee remains concerned at the difficulties encountered in eliminating such practices .  
With a view to strengthening the capacity of the existing health facilities to provide quality maternal health-care services , 58 female health personnel have been trained in essential obstetric care and basic obstetric care equipment and supplies were provided to health facilities in the region . 
Several Member States described criminal provisions that addressed bodily injury , noting that they were also applicable to some harmful traditional practices , such as female genital mutilation .

As part of this way of thinking , Chinese people strive to maintain a balance within the individual between the forces of yin and yang ( the dual principles of male and female , or positive and negative ) , which have influenced the concepts of hot and cold in Chinese food and medicine .  
The prime meaning of the word kan or " stem " is a strong and powerful tree trunk , representing the Yang or male principle ; the word chih or " branch " originally meant a weak and tender twig , thus representing the Yin or female principle .

In traditional Chinese ghost stories the principal character is often a fetchingly lovely female ghost . This no doubt heightens the tension of the story , but there is also a good reason behind it - - unmarried women who die young have no male progeny to carry out ancestral worship within their spouse 's family , neither can they be accommodated in their own family 's ancestral spirit tablet , which means their fate is more liable than most to be that of a wandering ghost .  
" One male patient received a heart from a female donor , and was worried he would turn into a woman , " recalls Dr . Chu with a smile .

One example can be found in the Taiwan television serial " Empress of an Age , " where aside from portraying the Empress Wu as a strong female in the traditional mold , the writers also see fit to credit her success to the support of two capable men .

Most of English-language radio station ICRT 's listening audience are students . David Wang , host of " The Youth Nightline , " believes that what concerns young people are passing exams , careers , interpersonal communication and male / female relations . But because this material gets mulled over a lot , " we have to interject topics from the news too . " In fact , he believes that such controversial and timely issues as campus violence and sex education are very well-received .  
The notion of female chastity began to be reinforced . Previously it had been common for widows to remarry , but from the Song onwards remarriage was seen as " unchaste , " and was not tolerated by the society of the time .

Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors .

An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
It stated that in many Asian countries , including Taiwan , attitudes of male superiority are deeply rooted , particularly in regions socially influenced by Confucianism and by the traditional notion that " there are three ways to be unfilial , and the worst is to be without issue . " In these societies , the report said , there are frequent cases of female infanticide , and of female fetuses being aborted after their sex is determined by medical tests .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
In fact the exact ratio of male to female births is not what is important . Scholars believe that a question even more worth discussing ought to be why , in a society which calls itself modern and prides itself on having created an economic miracle , the phenomenon of using prenatal diagnostic testing to determine fetal gender and then aborting female fetuses should exist at all . For if we attack mainland China 's one-child policy for producing infanticide , how is this practice different from what happens on the mainland ?  
Huang explains that turtle shell 's effects should n't be so narrowly defined . Rather it should be regarded as increasing general vitality , just as developing skills in waidan kung fu can develop one 's qi . And so whether one suffers from a sore back , nagging sore throat , or weak blood and qi ; whether one is male or female , old or young ; there are appropriate prescriptions containing turtle shell that vary according to age and condition .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types .

Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
Look back at all the various ghosts-the male ghost who fears that no one will look after him , the female phantom trapped in the pain of emotional hurt and revenge , the old man unable to rest in peace in a tomb full of water , and the aggrieved " substitute seeking " ghost looking everywhere for someone to stand in for it-and you will notice something interesting : The appearance of ghosts reflects the fact that life is too short ; the tragedies of ghosts represent the persistent attachment to the mundane world .  
Other topics include " loving a younger man " - is it shameful for a female student to become involved with a boy who is her academic junior ? - and , how to define " best friends of the opposite sex ? " The true stories that emerge through these discussions touch on the personal concerns of the participants .  
The female prosecutors tend to be a bit more cautious in these matters , paying careful attention to legal and procedural demands . Although this is only proper in respecting human rights , still the police often feel frustrated as a result .  
Of course , men and women are different . Just as cases involving guns or narcotics are commonly assigned to male prosecutors , currently many cases of " undermining public morality , " such as adultery , rape , prostitution , and violent sexual offenses , have been assigned to women . In this way , female victims are n't intimidated by a male prosecutor , or embarrassed to describe what happened in detail . It also prevents female victims from unintentionally being hurt more .  
It was discovered that in maledominated jobs-the military and police , construction workers , machinists-men use various roundabout methods to " mark their territory . " Thus posters of naked women , impossible to avoid seeing , are put up in factories . Or construction workers will urinate openly right in front of passing women . It even happens that women scholars doing field research or female students supporting labor rights may find themselves in dangerous situations in such environments .  
The millennial tradition of patrilineal filiation is being recognized by women 's groups as the source of two thousand years of Chinese preferential gender treatment , " valuing the male and devaluing the female , " and " ennobling the male and debasing the female . " Dagmar You says , " Patri-lineal filiation makes the male into the orthodox carrier of the lineage bloodline in perpetuity , and the females are removed from the genealogical records . "  
On October 13 , police in Hsinchu County 's Chutung Precinct broke a shocking criminal case involving youths-thirteen teenagers , both male and female , had confined a 14-year old girl to a room , beaten her to death , and then buried her body .  
Chinese have always encouraged those whose marriages are in trouble to stay together . Nevertheless , while divorce is certainly not desirable , it is the main way to bring unfortunate marriages to an end . It is an essential form of protection for both sexes . The problem is , when a marriage hits the rocks , can the male and female players agree to cut the knot as smoothly as they tied it ?  
Shunza 's music is classic US black music , ranging from rock and jazz to R &amp; B . A style that Taiwan 's female singers have rarely tried in the past has taken the market by storm , and her musical style and moving voice have been the subject of intense discussion on the Internet .  
Shunza , who was born in Beijing , grew up in the US and studied music in Switzerland , sings of the desire to return home after years of wandering , sentiments which have won her a following in the ranks of students living away from home . She has also touched upon lust , an area that female Taiwanese singers rarely do , with the lyrics " I just ca n't get enough of you . " She also sings that the world is so boring that even the toys protest .  
On items such as burial articles , painted bricks and " money trees , " there are numerous images of Xi Wang Mu , the Queen Mother of the West , accompanied by such motifs as immortal cranes , peaches of immortality and orioles .

Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .  
Socket joints were used to join the pieces together , with the male element on one piece fitting into the female element of the next piece . When molten bronze was then poured into the joint , it would harden and join the pieces together while preserving the smooth outer surface .

There are many other ancient Chinese paintings similar to this one of Xuanzong playing chuiwan . The players in them range from children to fine ladies-evidently in old China chuiwan was a game enjoyed by male and female , rich and poor alike .  
If you only knew about these two , you would think that the women of the Han court either spent their days relying on their beauty as weapons in internecine power struggles , or ended up getting married off to the ruler of a distant land to cement some strategic alliance . A code of proper female conduct was explicitly prescribed for the first time by two books that were written about 2,000 years ago .  
From Qingdao they went to Hunan and from Hunan to Guangzhou .

' It is common for an episode finished today to be shown two days later . "  
She takes for example feminist issues , about which she is particularly concerned . Twenty years ago , she wrote a TV serial that overturned the tradition that the female lead had to be chaste , unmarried , and dependent on men ; instead her female lead was a middle-aged divorcee with children and a relationship with a younger man . Society was shocked from top to bottom .  
Chinese society is male dominated , and women are mostly regarded as having a subsidiary role . In this kind of unfair situation , an upstanding man should cherish and respect women all the more . A considerate attitude can be expressed in little things . For instance , when you see that a hair has fallen onto a female friend 's shoulder , you should lightly pick it off for her , and throw it away or put it in your pocket .  
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan-ju made an acute observation about Yeh : Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .  
Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media . When a female postal worker complained of discriminatory testing , and a young man suffered constant harassment by tax authorities after his ID card was used for someone else 's tax file , Chang took their cases to administrative authorities for the fair treatment they deserved . In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .  
At the time the country was already running into financial difficulties , and social welfare expenditures were growing rapidly . Based on her solid financial and tax background and her incredible ability with figures , she came to serve as the gate-keeper . In 1995 , she became the first female director of the DNT , and within less than half a year she was named as director of the FTC .  
Luantan by day . . . For a long time , traditional Chinese moral concepts effectively banned females from performing in the often-suggestive three-part tea-picking opera , so the female roles used to be played in most cases by male performers . That did not change in any major way until the 1940s when a group of child stars-including Cheng Jung-hsing 's grandmother ( Cheng Mei-mei ) and Ah Yu-tan-broke the taboo .  
In February of last year , the female snake 's belly gradually began to swell , and an ultrasound examination confirmed she was pregnant .

For about five days the female can be seen shuttling back and forth , carrying in her beak dry twigs and pine needles from which she constructs the nest . Once the structure is stable she gathers dry leaves to make a soft , comfortable layer on top . Finally , she lifts up her tail and plumps herself down on her bottom , moving round in a circle , to make the nest dense and firm . The finished nest is shaped like a bowl hanging below the branch .  
In the years that followed Lan taught himself the historian 's craft and collected a rich store of materials which , as he explains , were the origin of his latest book : " I had collected a wealth of materials waiting to be classified and arranged , but the stories of these five women provided me with the most complete source for shedding light on the true face of the female victims of the White Terror . "

Wing quivers , sideways rolls , 360-degree forward and backward flips , and rapid hunting dives with wings pulled in , are all regular elements of the male birds ' body language in the mating season . The variety of their antics causes birdwatchers to cry out in delight , and the female birds watching from the sidelines do not act coy either . They keep their eyes firmly fixed on the males , watching their every move , ready to reward them for their efforts by choosing the partner that pleases them best .  
As visitors , ensconced in a fog of incense smoke , worshipped this seated , silver-faced female deity who protected the people when they first came here to build the town , they were also able to have a detailed look at the main hall , exquisitely sculpted by the early Republican masters Li Huan-mei , Chiang Hsin , and Kuo Hsin-lin , and imagine the exciting scenes of yesteryear when boats filled the harbor and their sails filled the sky .  
Bringing together rich and poor , male and female , young and old , it forms a many-sided portrait of life in Taipei , divided into four sections : " Car , " " Home , " " Body " and " Feeling . " From the lives of people who consider themselves normal , she uncovers so much that is humorous and twisted .

Starting out as two-dimensional lines and colors , Huang 's complex totem-pole-like models undergo a process of simplification and purification as they are transformed into three-dimensional stainless steel objects . Lines formed in the mind and on a drawing board give way to succinct , elegant metallic curves . Rough sketches of the male and female forms become bodies with delicately wrought curves . Heads are almost done away with or only suggested at by welded eyes and eye sockets .  
At the threshold of the modestly sized temple are a pair of lions carved from a single slab of stone-female on the right , male on the left . The male is playing with a ball , while the female is supporting a cub . The carving of the hard stone is exquisite .  
Professor Lin Wan-I of the Department of Social Work , National Taiwan University , recalls that four years ago , when he was vice-mayor of Taipei City , he was astonished to discover that junior high schools had rules that stipulated that female students who got pregnant would be considered to have committed the equivalent of three major violations of the school code and would therefore be expelled .  
For instance , in his freshman year he easily won first prize in a violin competition . But the real reason he moved in the direction of music was probably that he had a crush on a female classmate of his , a girl with long flowing hair who also played violin well . Just to be near her , Lee transferred to the Department of Music , hoping he could win her over .  
Li sets her stories in her hometown of Lukang , here appearing as the city of Lu , about which vengeful female spirits have entrenched themselves , one each to the north , south , east , and west , and another in its center . Their implacability has put them outside of the cycle of life and death-unable to be reborn , they tarry in the human world as ghosts . Over the course of time , these ghosts have participated in and even helped to forge the island 's history .  
The Chinese Taipei team was the 181st to enter , with the male athletes wearing dark blue jackets and gray pants , while the female athletes wore light blue suits .

The Committee acknowledged the State party 's initiatives to provide bilingual education but expressed its concern at the inadequacy of those initiatives , which posed a major obstacle to women 's access to social and economic opportunities , since a large percentage of the female population spoke only Guaran , the predominant aboriginal language .  
The Committee noted with regret that the economic constraints resulting from the transition process were having a negative impact on women 's employment and health ; female unemployment was increasing and the quality of social services provided to women was deteriorating .  NULLIn addition , the state of health of the female population was unsatisfactory when judged by international standards .  
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
Peace is built through ordinary coexistence , with all Guatemalans , male or female , striving daily to make a living and to help their families get ahead , seeking out better opportunities while enduring hardships in a country with so many limitations and so much distrust .

On the subject of participation by women in political life , she stated that female candidates were more successful in contests at the local level , where they were known personally to voters , although the proportion of women elected to municipal assemblies had fallen from approximately 30 per cent in the 1980s to only 16 per cent in 1990 . 
In that resolution , the Assembly dealt with the matter from a criminological perspective , inviting Member States to adopt specific measures to make the crime prevention and criminal justice system more responsive to domestic violence , for example , by enacting criminal law and procedure and improving the situation and the fair treatment of the female victim .  
Other elements identified as important , especially as regards sex crime , were : the adoption of adequate legislation ; the setting-up of special offices at police stations with separate facilities ; the provision of assistance and especially trained practitioners to handle female victimization ; conducting specialized , multifaceted training courses ; setting up specialized police units ; establishing national reference centres to collect and analyse data and effectively monitor , prevent and suppress the phenomenon ; education ; coordination ; and information dissemination .

Their lower status and the gender roles assigned by society result in unmet needs which are experienced both by drug-using women and female partners of male drug abusers in various social , cultural and economic environments .  Furthermore , it has been found that women are more likely than men to become infected with HIV through both sexual transmission and intravenous injection .  
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate - the appropriate age group to be determined in each country - to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;  
This applies to female employees as well , and legislation is in force preventing discrimination against women based on maternal duties , stipulating that the duration of creditable service time must include the time spent in child care , equivalent in length to maternity leave or extended maternity leave ( as specified by relevant legislation ) , as well as time spent in all-day care for a child with severely impaired health , as regulated by specific legislation ( maximum six years of the sum of such creditable times ) .

Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often results in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;

The fastest promotions were not always linked to competence and efficiency : recent times had witnessed a drastic curtailment of the promotions of male staff members as they had increasingly come up against stiff female competition buttressed by comprehensive preferential measures .  
The term " rape " was not defined , and although it was possible to adapt the term " rape " to sociological realities , that is to say to take account of present-day sexual practices , there was a reluctance to do so ; in most cases the only act characterized as rape was that ultimate violation of the person which is likely to result in pregnancy .  [ 66 ] Oral and anal penetrations forced on a person , whether male or female , were , at most , punishable as indecent assaults .  
In order to provide enterprises with incentives to adopt innovative measures to promote female employment , a special award was established in 1993 at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour and Employment to reward those enterprises which have taken action to increase the participation of women in the labour force , improve the quality of female employment , develop their potential , including through the strengthening of programmes to provide education and vocational training , and eliminate or counteract the negative consequences in women 's work .  
In a judgement rendered on 21 April 1982 , the Supreme Court of Justice , ruling on appeal , declared void a provision on bank employees ' labour contracts which gave married male employees the unreserved right to a domestic subsidy , while allowing the subsidy to married female employees only under severely restricted conditions . 
The scope for female employment has been rapidly expanded by technological change , increasing concentration of employment in service industries , increased flexibility of work times and availability of part-time work , changing social attitudes towards female employment , and improved provision of childcare .  
The latter includes : ( i ) general actions related to shelter , services and settlement-wide issues ; ( ii ) actions for families in especially difficult circumstances ( including those in critical housing conditions , the homeless , female headed households and evicted families ) ; and ( iii ) specific actions for children ( mainly children in especially difficult circumstances ) .  
The right of disabled children to a full and decent life and to special care and the rights to abolition of traditional practices which are prejudicial to the health of children , such as early marriage , female genital mutilation , denial of equal sustenance and inheritance for girls are also highly relevant in the context of HIV / AIDS .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them in the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impedes their upward mobility and further reinforces discrimination against women in the labour market .  
The Committee was also concerned that the country had not made much real progress in implementing the Convention and that , despite its efforts , it had yet to respond effectively to problems such as domestic violence , prostitution , early pregnancy , female illiteracy , discrimination in the workplace in terms of how much women were paid , the high percentage of women receiving less than the minimum wage , the elimination of stereotypes , and the changes that needed to be made in the country 's legal system , which reinforced existing stereotypes .  
The Committee remains concerned at prevailing traditional attitudes and harmful practices , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies , and at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes against vulnerable groups of children , such as the girl child , disabled children , children born out of wedlock and children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans .  
Such measures would promote change in persisting negative attitudes towards children , particularly girls , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans , and contribute to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health and well-being of children , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies .  
Measures that have been adopted by some political parties include setting aside for women a certain minimum number or percentage of positions on their executive bodies , ensuring that there is a balance between the number of male and female candidates nominated for election , and ensuring that women are not consistently assigned to less favourable constituencies or to the least advantageous positions on a party list .  
Such women benefited from a number of special measures , such as the provision of safe shelter ; counselling by professional social workers ; the possibility of requesting that the administrative procedures in their case should be carried out by a female official of the Ministry of Justice and that a female interpreter should be provided ; language courses scheduled so as to be compatible with family life ; and specialized services for women refugees who obtained residence permits .  
The Platform for Action defines violence against women as including Physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , including battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry _ related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non _ spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ( para .  113 ) .  
In its concluding comments concerning the combined initial , second and third periodic reports of Ethiopia ( A / 51 / 38 , fifteenth session ) , the Committee expressed great concern with respect to the widespread practice of female genital mutilation , as well as the incidence of violence against women and girls and the insufficiency of measures to eradicate it .

Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
Similarly , although the Civil Service Regulations make no distinction between the salaries , working hours and period of employment of male and female workers , they fail to provide adequate support for working women , particularly since the pension payable to a woman is not inherited by her family in the event of her death .  Moreover , the social security and health insurance of a working woman do not include her husband and children unless it is confirmed that they are in need and proven that the female employee is directly responsible for their maintenance .  
In order to take effective legislative and political measures to ensure equality between women and men , Bulgaria had adopted a national plan of action in 1996 aimed at protecting the human rights of women , improving their economic and social status , eradicating female poverty , promoting the participation of women in decision-making , improving the health of women and eliminating all forms of violence against women .

At the internal level , the relation between the Government and its citizens is based , as I said before , on constitutional legitimacy ; on equality among all citizens , whether male or female ; on equality in rights and obligations of men and women alike ; on the freedom of individuals and groups ; on the freedom of association to parties , trade unions and civilian community organizations ; on freedom of the press ; and on the protection of human rights .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
There should also be special attention given to promoting social protection for vulnerable or marginalized groups of women workers , especially international female migrant workers , women in transition economies adversely affected by economic reforms and long-term unemployed older women workers .  
Where women have demonstrated a clear preference for those parties and candidates that are gender-sensitive and supportive of women 's interests , especially with regard to reproductive rights , social services , participation in decision-making , elimination of violence against women and environmental protection , close parliamentary or presidential contests have been influenced or the outcome determined by the female voters and their preferences .

Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
UNFPA is the lead agency for integration of reproductive health care , which includes sexual health and family planning , maternal and neonatal care , prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections , sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , and elimination of harmful practices , including female genital mutilation ( FGM ) and violence against women .  
They were urged to eliminate negative cultural practices and attitudes against girls and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against girls and the root causes of son preference , which resulted in harmful and unethical practices , inter alia , by enacting and enforcing legislation protecting girls from violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse and exploitation . 
Furthermore , under the special General Initiative Fund for Refugee Women , project support is being provided for the training of 100 traditional birth attendants in seven districts of Afghanistan ; for improving the reproductive health of refugee women in Malawi , which includes family planning advisory services , education on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS prevention and the addressing of cultural constraints and male attitudes to reproductive health care ; and for an educational video on female genital mutilation in Eritrea and related reproductive health care .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them into the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impeded their upward mobility and further reinforced discrimination against women in the labour market .  
On the subject of refugee status being granted to women fleeing female genital mutilation as mentioned by the Special Rapporteur in her final report , note should be taken with satisfaction of the initiative taken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in September 1996 when it assembled the representatives of 16 Western countries in Geneva to draw the attention of the authorities responsible for awarding refugee status to the problems specific to women and which differ from the generally recognized forms of political persecution .  
However , it was regrettable that no reference was made to the situation of female migrant workers , who suffered multiple discrimination based on sex and national or ethnic origin and very often lacked adequate legal status in the host countries .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .  
There were fewer women than men in the labour force , mainly because many women were engaged in child rearing , and much of the unpaid female work in the agricultural sector was not generally recorded as economic activity .  
The legislative position supported by the Government conforms with advice from the World Health Organization that legislation should set an unequivocal standard that all forms of female genital mutilation are inappropriate .  
Urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
While welcoming the State party 's innovative measures , both legal and educational , to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices affecting the health of girls , the Committee expresses its concern at the limited impact of these measures .  
at the national level , there are cases of discrimination against unmarried female pupils and teachers who , because of pregnancy , are expelled from private religious schools or , exceptionally , from State educational institutions on the ground that they may have a bad influence on other pupils .  
The European Union stressed the need to prohibit female genital mutilation , and supported the practical steps taken by Governments , intergovernmental bodies , non-governmental organizations , community organizations and religious institutions to eliminate such practices through , inter alia , efforts to change societal attitudes by raising awareness of the harmful effects of such practices .  
Among such practices were female genital circumcision , which also posed grave health risks for females ; arranged marriages without consent and contracted against personal will ; sexual harassment , which had become widespread ; force-feeding ; and removal of children from their mother at an early age .  
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate the appropriate age group to be determined in each country to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;

The Special Rapporteur was very impressed with the far-reaching and exemplary work undertaken by the government-sponsored Sudan National Committee on Traditional Practices ( SNCTP ) , officially established in 1988 with the objective of eradicating harmful practices endangering the health of women and children , chief among them female genital mutilation ( FGM ) . 
She had also stressed the need to take into account the rapid growth of the female labour force in developing countries and to protect workers in the informal sector , most of whom were women , and had argued that the Governments of developing countries should move slowly in adopting policies for economic liberalization , which reduced the demand for unskilled female workers .  
Governments should strive to ensure that by 2015 all primary health-care and family-planning facilities are able to provide , directly or through referral , the widest achievable range of safe and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods ; essential obstetric care ; prevention and management of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , and barrier methods ( such as male and female condoms and microbicides if available ) to prevent infection .

The Philippine delegation fully supports the various measures under the section on international migration which are directed at protecting and improving the conditions of migrant workers , particularly female migrant workers , who are easily exploited and harassed .  
Indeed , the national plan for comprehensive health care for adolescents and young people recognizes that male and female teenagers are capable within the law of taking informed and responsible decisions about their sexuality and reproduction , and that for them to do so they must be provided with suitable guidance and accessible services just for them .  
Other women-based policies since put in place deal with the elimination of female genital mutilation ; adolescent health ; legal reforms to eliminate domestic violence and to raise the minimum age for marriage to 18 years ; and the development of a strategic framework for the implementation of adolescent reproductive health , among others .  
The reproductive health situation is also very poor , with high-risk programmes , high maternal mortality rates , a high rate of infant and child deaths , high fertility rates , a low contraceptive prevalence rate , a high proportion of unmet reproductive health needs , and the existence of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation . 
The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
It was in the proper understanding of the important role of women in the development process and of their right to physical integrity that the Burkina Faso Government established a national committee to combat all forms of discrimination against women and adopted a law prohibiting and punishing female genital mutilation .  
This plan revolves around seven priority areas : first , improvement of the living conditions of women ; second , improvement of the legal status of women ; third , development of female human resources in all the development sectors ; fourth , access by women to effective decision-making ; fifth , promotion and protection of the girl child ; sixth , combatting violence against women ; and seventh , improvement of the institutional framework .  
When one studies traditional practices , in particular female genital mutilation , it must first be noted that they are rooted in a whole set of beliefs , values , cultural and social behaviour patterns governing the lives of the societies concerned .  
The programme it drew up is based on consciousness _ raising , the adoption of a common law against the practice , institutional capacity _ building in the national committees , which should , it is said , be attached to the departments in charge of the campaign against female genital mutilation , the conversion of female excisionists , and the formulation of a media plan .  
On that basis , the majority of Libyan legislative acts promulgated after the Great Revolution of 1 September are directed at all citizens , irrespective of gender ; they prescribe numerous rights to be enjoyed in all fields , without distinction between men and women , in so far as they are fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , both male and female .  
Most Libyan legislative acts are directed at all citizens , irrespective of their sex , and prescribe the body of rights which they enjoy in the political , functional , economic , social , cultural , health and educational fields , without discrimination between men and women , being fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , whether male or female .  
In accordance with the objective of health for all , the State spent tremendous sums of money on the health sector with a view to providing a health service for every male and female citizen , without distinction , and developing health services , medicines and free treatment in line with the latest international scientific developments and in quantities and qualities proportionate to the needs of all citizens .  
If providing food to poor families in all parts of the country is given equal value in a financially expensive programme of food security , the female children in backward villages may continue to be deprived , if social reforms are not pursued effectively . most vulnerable . 
While welcoming the State party 's efforts to adopt measures , both legal and educational , to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices affecting the health of children , the Committee remains concerned at the difficulties encountered in eliminating such practices .

Female infanticide was addressed in the Commissions resolution 1999 / 80 , on the rights of the child , with States being called upon to eliminate the root causes of son preference which resulted in harmful and unethical practices , and to eradicate traditional or customary practices , particularly female genital mutilation , that were harmful to women and girls and that violated their human rights .  
The statement indicated that female genital mutilation was considered by a number of societies to be an initiation rite which allowed the girl child to integrate into the community and stressed the importance of training , information and education as effective means to combat harmful traditional practices and noted that judicial decisions should be a last recourse in that context .  
UNFPA continued to address harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage because of their impact on womens reproductive and sexual health and as violations of womens fundamental human rights .  
Replies received from Member States indicated that traditional and customary practices affecting the health of women and girls , in particular female genital mutilation , continued to be the subject of national action .  
Other issues examined included : the economic , social and cultural factors that encourage the expectation that women will take care of the elderly ; whether care-giver is a universal female identity ; and widowhood and how it is affected by the economic and demographic changes occurring in different parts of the world .

The above law is applicable both to the public and private sectors , and , apart from defining the concept of indirect discrimination , it establishes that discriminatory practices occur when there is a considerable disproportion between the number of male and female workers .  
Further urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
HTPs include female genital mutilation , early marriage and the attendant harmful consequences of early pregnancies , widowhood practices , discriminatory inheritance and property laws , bride price , betrothal rights , parental consent , discriminatory divorce laws , lack of contractual capacity , wife battering , male child preference , and unequal access to education and health care .

It was pleased to note that many countries had taken legal measures to eliminate cultural , religious or traditional practices , including female genital mutilation , that violated the human rights of women and girls.Although in keeping with the duty of States to protect all human rights , such actions were insufficient by themselves to end those practices and should be supplemented with education and public awareness campaigns .  
Governments should give priority to developing programmes and policies that foster norms and attitudes of zero tolerance for harmful and discriminatory attitudes , including son preference , which can result in harmful and unethical practices such as prenatal sex selection , discrimination and violence against the girl child and all forms of violence against women , including female genital mutilation , rape , incest , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation .
