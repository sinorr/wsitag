They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
As all types of economic targets are large in number and wide in scope ; are interrelated with one another ; and are under the control of different departments , some of which are also large in size ; are exposed to a large extent ; and are highly vulnerable owing to their state of production , operation , or utilization in peace time , it is difficult and costly to protect them .  Also it is unrealistic to protect them in an all-round way and hard to raise their protection efficiency .  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .  
Given this , and as proven by a series of recent local wars , in joint operations , aside from concentrating " capability " for a strike aimed at destroying the enemy 's " hardware " , such as personnel and arms , a belligerent will also have to concentrate superior forces and lethal weapons for a strike at the enemy 's weapons systems , information systems , logistic support systems , and especially at their vital and vulnerable points , in order to paralyze the enemy 's vital systems . 
Besides , a belligerent will have to mount both a " soft " strike and a " hard " strike at the enemy 's most threatening and vulnerable points , in order to destroy with information weapons , the enemy 's vital electronic equipment , which seem virtually immune to an electromagnetic strike , and damage with non-information weapons , the enemy 's electronic information carriers , through a " hard " strike .  
In order to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of vulnerable employee groups , trade unions must find out about their genuine conditions in a timely manner , present their reasonable requests to party and government leaders in a factual way , work energetically with party and government organs and relevant departments to solve their practical difficulties and problems , and make a success of ideological education for them with patience and meticulous attention .  
" The currency turmoil is telling us how and why our wealth could be cut by half because of weaknesses in the financial intermediation process in Asia which made us vulnerable to volatile speculative capital flows , " said Mr Yam .  
For example , foreign banks generally kept much smaller clearing balances because their lack of extensive retail networks made their liquidity less vulnerable to unpredictable swings , and because their dependence on interbank funding implied a higher opportunity cost in holding surplus liquidity than was faced by banks with a sizeable retail deposit base .  
I believe we should put in hand an action plan which will highlight the importance of the social and human aspects of economic development , and the needd to address the concerns of the most vulnerable groups of our community and the action plan should incorporate specific projects and programmes which will draw on the best practices in individual economies and on the appropriate advice from business and labour as well as from international organisations .

To wild dolphins , human is the biggest threat to them apart from shark , its main predator .  Thousands of dolphins die everyday in fishing nets around the world .  What 's more , the seriously polluted environment makes dolphins increasingly vulnerable .  In view of that , many scientists , naturalists and marine biologists devote their lifetime to study dolphins , their mode of communication , foraging and social behaviors so as to preserve these graceful and extraordinary creatures .  
" Cases in foreign countries showed that vulnerable infants like hospitalized prematures , low birth-weight and babies with underlying medical conditions can fall ill after consuming infant formula contaminated with the bacterium .  
Some people are still doing business much like their forefathers did generations before . Most of the narrow streets paved with granite slabs are now gone . Among Lukang 's fantastic construction features are the covered streets . They resemble ancient castles , so designed to make them less vulnerable to damage from strong winds and to offer protection from pillaging by bandits .  
" One shovelful could fill a tin can . " Today vast stretches of land have been developed , and pesticides have been badly overused in cultivated areas . Earthworms are highly vulnerable to sudden acute poisoning , " so that in many hectares of farmland , you could n't find a single worm , " says Huang , who worked hard with Kuo looking for the creatures in agricultural areas in Hsinchu .  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
Tomatoes ca n't stand high temperatures at night and they are vulnerable to bacterial wilt . AVRDC cultivation expert Chen Cheng-tsu , who has developed a number of excellent tomato strains , is untiring in his continued research on this highly nutritious fruit .  
With the trend towards the concentration of medical treatment in hospitals , rates of in-hospital infection have risen greatly . Lien Te-cheng , an attending physician in the Department of Respiratory Therapy at Taipei 's Veterans General Hospital , suggests that it is best if in-patients are discharged as soon as they are 70% recovered , because somebody just recovering from a major illness is much more vulnerable to any secondary infection which they might contract in hospital .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
Society sighs and shakes it collective head at this subgroup , which consists of disadvantaged individuals , often unemployed and / or single parents , stuck on the lower rungs both socially and economically . When faced with injustice or adversity , they often do not know how to express their emotions or where to seek help . These lonely , helpless , marginalized individuals are most vulnerable to anger-whether as its wielders or its victims .  
In line with the harsh predictions concerning " dejobbing " set forth in the book Jobshift : How to Prosper in a Workplace without Jobs , regular full-time , lifelong jobs with fixed objectives are quickly and quietly disappearing . After being laid off , many individuals are setting up their own private offices . Some do well ; most find themselves vulnerable . Left with no choice , they become security guards , sell insurance , do what they can to earn a couple extra bucks .  
Most of them are facing the challenges of globalization with economies made uniquely vulnerable by the crushing weight of foreign indebtedness , their precarious internal balance and a highly unfavourable international economic environment .

Much productive work of great social importance is not remunerated , such as caring for children and the elderly , protecting the environment and providing voluntary assistance to vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals and groups .  
The most vulnerable groups children , women , the elderly and the disabled were paying the highest price for shortsighted economic policies , political blunders , war and serious violations of human rights .  
The continent remained highly vulnerable to inequitable international economic policies , it was a frequent victim of natural disasters and it had an overwhelming debt burden at a time when financial flows were drying up and commodity prices remained low .  
A smaller number of resettlement places is required , predominantly for selected individuals whose physical security is threatened , or for vulnerable refugees for whom resettlement remains the only suitable , durable and humane solution .  
Small size also means that our entire society , not just areas of it , is equally vulnerable to dislocations of the global economic system , including currency and commodity price fluctuations , new international trading arrangements , and the changing fortunes of the major industrial economies .  
Emphasis has also been placed on the reform of the public sector and the provision of basic infrastructure in order to ensure the efficient delivery of reliable , high-quality services , the progressive restructuring of our educational system so as to put in place a sustainable human-resource development programme which would respond to the new challenges and needs of our development , and the employment of social policies aimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society .  
To achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development we need a supportive and favourable international economic environment as well as a fair , open and non-discriminatory trading system , one which recognizes that small and vulnerable economies like our own are at a particular disadvantage because of our size and the lack of economies of scale .

Nationally determined policies for integrated and multifaceted programmes , with special attention to women , to the poorest people living in critical areas and to other vulnerable groups should be implemented , ensuring the involvement of groups with a special potential to act as agents for change and sustainable development .  
In addition to meeting basic health needs , specific emphasis has to be given to protecting and educating vulnerable groups , particularly infants , youth , women , indigenous people and the very poor as a prerequisite for sustainable development .  
The general objectives of protecting vulnerable groups are to ensure that all such individuals should be allowed to develop to their full potential ( including healthy physical , mental and spiritual development ) ; to ensure that young people can develop , establish and maintain healthy lives ; to allow women to perform their key role in society ; and to support indigenous people through educational , economic and technical opportunities .  
Ensure that disadvantaged and vulnerable persons and groups are included in social development , and that society acknowledges and responds to the consequences of disability by securing the legal rights of the individual and by making the physical and social environment accessible ;

Ensure that structural adjustment programmes are so designed as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and communities , while ensuring their positive effects on such groups and communities by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities and devising measures to ensure that they gain access to and control over economic resources and economic and social activities ; actions should be taken to reduce inequality and economic disparity ;  
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed so as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to ensure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
To mitigate the heavy burdens of the poor , the Social Fund for Development ( SFD ) was established in 1991 as a temporary step to enhance structural adjustment programmes as well as to contribute to social well-being and protect vulnerable and low-income groups .

Although they said that the main focus of UNICEF should continue to be in rural areas , several delegations stressed the need for UNICEF to emphasize poor populations living in such environmentally vulnerable areas as slums and marginal urban pockets .  
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to assure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .

that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
The role of public administration must be reviewed if we are to face the increasing complexity of development challenges , such as the eradication of poverty , the growing interdependence of societies , the promotion of social justice and of a participatory democracy , the globalization of the economy , the protection of the environment and the need to increase internal stability in countries vulnerable to civil conflicts .  
In this context , the State seeks to modernize the kinds of measures taken by its public administration by gradually shifting its management and production actions towards a stronger public administration role in overseeing regulation and the proper functioning of economic mechanisms , in guaranteeing political and social stability and in protecting the most vulnerable sectors of society , in a spirit of social justice and rational solidarity .

We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
Furthermore , my Government places particular emphasis on the needs of vulnerable groups , such as the disabled , in the process of social development , in the firm conviction that a genuinely sound and prosperous society can be realized only when all people , irrespective of their physical or mental disadvantages , are able to pursue a life of happiness and dignity based on stability and equality .  
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
A low level of development , poverty , unemployment , the external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations of the world market are some of the major ones .  
In addition , the problems of persistent poverty , increasing unemployment , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , environmental degradation , drug abuse and drug trafficking , crime , terrorism and social disintegration have combined to present a formidable array of challenges , which , if left unaddressed , threaten to overwhelm us and further marginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us . 
After 14 years of consideration of this item in this Committee , my delegation is gratified that the international community now has a better understanding of this remote and pristine continent and of the need for collective efforts to protect this fragile and vulnerable environment for the common benefit of humankind . 
During this time , Member States that have participated in the deliberations have spoken on a wide range of issues surrounding that continent , especially its role and influence on the atmosphere , oceans , biological conditions of the entire global system and the fragility of its environment , which is vulnerable to the impact of human activities .  
Stresses that Governments , in partnership with civil society and all other development actors , including non-governmental organizations and people living in poverty and their organizations should cooperate to meet the basic human needs of all - inter alia , income , resources , education , health care , nutrition , shelter , sanitation and safe water - in particular of people living in poverty and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups ;  
Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
India was encouraged that the international community had adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which underlined the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights , civil , political , economic , social and cultural , identified new forms of intolerance and violence and defined particularly vulnerable groups ( children and minorities ) who deserved special consideration .  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
Currently , the health of women in Rwanda was extremely vulnerable due to lack of medical infrastructure , supplies and personnel , limited financial resources , lack of access to health care , malnutrition , unsafe drinking-water , and the spread of HIV / AIDS . Women were more susceptible to diseases than men because they were overworked , had unplanned pregnancies , were malnourished during pregnancy and suffered complications from childbirth . 
[ Depending on local conditions in the housing sector and the availability of legal protection guaranteeing equal access to resources and opportunities , ] vulnerable groups include the poorest groups , some of the older persons , street children , youth , [ documented ] migrants , internally displaced persons , inhabitants of disadvantaged communities , people affected by natural and human-caused disasters , households headed by women , persons with disabilities and some indigenous people .

The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
In other countries , such as has been independently reported in Malaysia , traditional healing as a means of treatment of dependence is sometimes based on beliefs that persons are vulnerable to supernatural influences , as well as physical causes , which increase the probability of dependence arising . 56 In such instances , traditional healers focus upon the well-being of the individual , and detoxification involves the use of herbal medicines , physical exercise and the promotion of physical health .  NULLThe role of acupuncture in the treatment of dependence has become more widespread in recent years .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
The number of individuals living in water-stressed countries or countries with a chronic water scarcity will increase tenfold in only one generation to encompass more than one third of the world population .  In waste areas , there has been an overexploitation of aquifers , which are becoming ever more seriously depleted .  The risks that threaten to erupt wherever socio-economic development depends on a continuously undermined key resource are evident : ultimate resource constraints will one day send shocks through such vulnerable societies .  
If followed through to a logical conclusion , a multisectoral , system-wide programming approach could facilitate work with the vulnerable rural youth audience by dealing with all aspects of the drug problem through a number of simultaneous activities including programmes in formal and non-formal education and competency-based training , demand reduction , construction of health facilities and addressing related health issues , law enforcement and crime prevention issues , alternative crop production and other drug-related issues in any given country .  NULLOrganizational approach to developing a multiple agency ,  
Society 's assigned roles and perceptions also play a part in the way men and women are involved in illicit trafficking ; are vulnerable to punitive actions from the law enforcement sectors ; are subject to human rights violations ; and are perceived in the community .

The main focus of the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable segments of the populations .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed as well as certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Over the past year , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , in close coordination with other United Nations bodies , has provided assistance to help countries to properly assess their full spectrum of risks , to prescribe , on the basis of global experience , the most cost-effective disaster reduction measures , to coordinate external guidance where needed on how to apply those measures in the most vulnerable areas , and to stimulate wider involvement and closer cooperation among the numerous international agencies with relevant technical and managerial expertise .  
The system is based on the criterion of rationalizing the use of State penal power by offering such options as : ( a ) punishing crime that has a high social cost and reducing the severity of punishment for less serious crimes ; ( b ) avoiding discrimination against the more vulnerable sectors , such as women and indigenous people ; ( c ) scrupulously respecting constitutional guarantees such as the principles of legality and guilt ; and ( d ) guaranteeing the rational and egalitarian implementation of the law .  
We agree to support ongoing and new creative partnerships , recognizing that indigenous people , youth and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups possess in common the potential for diverse realization of full human development .  
In the United Nations human rights programme of assistance , priority will be given to establishing criteria and implementing procedures for promoting economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , to exploring the root causes of human rights violations , to protecting the rights of persons who can be particularly vulnerable to abuse or neglect , including youth , persons with disabilities , the elderly and migrant workers .  
As part of the plan , which involved the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and several international non-governmental organizations , relief food and essential drugs were provided to vulnerable groups , seeds and tools were distributed to farming families , special feeding centres were set up and vaccination campaigns were conducted .  
At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
By a note verbale dated 30 August 1996 ( A / 51 / 330-S / 1996 / 721 and Corr . 1 ) , the representative of Bulgaria transmitted to the Secretary-General a national communication on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 50 / 58 E , in which it is pointed out , inter alia , that , by virtue of its geographic location and the outward nature of its economy , Bulgaria has been extremely vulnerable to the negative side effects of the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .

Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
The family unit in India was very strong and provided the social security net for vulnerable family members ; however , the traditional extended or joint family was increasingly being eroded because of the strains of modern life . 
The Commission continued to alert the international community to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; torture and enforced disappearance ; arbitrary detention ; violence against women , children and vulnerable groups ; the problem of internally displaced persons , extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , etc .  
It was mentioned that the Centre was also committed to protecting and maintaining the historic , cultural and natural heritage of indigenous and other people , and that Governments , as enabling partners , should create and strengthen effective partnerships with vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities .  
In its concluding observations on the report of Finland , the Committee expressed concern at the absence of an integrated monitoring mechanism capable , inter alia , of supervising the effectiveness of decentralized and sometimes privatized social ( health , education and social care ) municipal policies and services for the most vulnerable groups of society , including minority children .  
It is important that an effective mechanism be established , so that international actors and the authorities can discuss issues of common concern on a regular basis , share information on current activities and take joint decisions , especially on how best to meet the needs of vulnerable groups .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .

Xenophobia , intolerance and false doctrines of racial superiority gave rise to acts of discrimination and violence against vulnerable groups , migrant workers and foreigners ; it was therefore essential to give the highest support to the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination , a framework which would make it possible to address the political manipulation of intolerance through new efforts at the national and international levels .  
The Committee advised applicant States wishing to undertake energy-related exports to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for humanitarian purposes , that it was not in a position to approve the supply of energy-related products to the country for general distribution ; however , without prejudice to its final decision , the Committee expressed readiness to consider requests for authorization of shipments of strictly limited quantities of fuel targeting specific end-users among the most vulnerable groups of civilian population and for purely humanitarian purposes .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
He called on the secretariat to take into account , in all aspects of its work , the prevailing critical situation of those Latin American and Caribbean countries that had structurally weak and vulnerable economies , especially in the application of technical cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling governments to create an environment that was conducive to sustainable development and strengthening these countries ' capacity to participate fully in the international economy , trade and investment .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Noting with very deep concern that the total economic blockade imposed against Burundi seriously penalizes the most vulnerable social groups , particularly the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons , the tens of thousands of returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ,  
Noting the seriousness of the alarming effects of economic sanctions on humanitarian operations and assistance intended to provide relief to the most vulnerable social groups , particularly the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons , the tens of thousands of returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ,  
Noting with very deep concern that the total economic blockade imposed against Burundi seriously penalizes the most vulnerable social groups , particularly the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons , the tens of thousands of returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ,  
Yugoslavia has privatized some 90 per cent of the public housing stock and the issues now being addressed include maintenance of the existing housing stock , legalization of housing developments which are not in accordance with the approved plans , engaging local authorities in solving the housing problems of vulnerable groups , review of standards and norms and improving the database on housing .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
Barbados shares the anxiety of small developing States , which are highly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercely competitive environment given our sparse natural and human-resource base and limited administrative and technical capacity .  
With the successful conclusion of the military observer Mission in Guatemala , the definitive ceasefire between the Government and the URNG has established the necessary conditions for the promotion of peace and development in a subregion of the Americas which has been particularly vulnerable to pernicious blends of internal strife and external interference .  
Furthermore , the need calls for strengthening coordination between the aforementioned and other regional and international development programmes , and first and foremost the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , in order to mobilize economic resources and their generous influx of contributions required for a speedy response to the needs of affected and vulnerable peoples .  
These human rights are reinforced by the principles of participatory democracy , which assumes the involvement of PLHAs and their families , women , children and groups vulnerable to HIV / AIDS in designing and implementing programmes that will be most effective by being tailored to the specific needs of these groups .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
The basic principles of the negotiations are recognized as dialogue , mutual and continuing respect between the parties , voluntary resettlement of individuals , non _ discrimination , observance of the letter and spirit of the peace agreements , protection of the environment , maximum social benefit , preferential and special treatment of vulnerable groups , and community participation .  
The Committee is concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
The Committee remains concerned at prevailing traditional attitudes and harmful practices , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies , and at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes against vulnerable groups of children , such as the girl child , disabled children , children born out of wedlock and children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans .  
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
The representative of Uruguay supported by the observer for Costa Rica , stressed the importance of preventive measures and international cooperation in eradicating basic problems such as socio _ economic ones , which made children more vulnerable to such practices . 
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
In addition , these factors illustrate the need to exploit the potentially mutually supportive role of the public and private sectors and the importance of the current work under GATS on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .  12 .  Trade in the health service sector also demonstrates the extremely vulnerable position of poorer , especially least developed countries , which on the one hand suffer from a " brain drain " and on the other do not have access to advanced technologies .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
The large packagings shall be dropped onto a rigid , non-resilient , smooth , flat and horizontal surface , in such a manner as to ensure that the point of impact is that part of the base of the large packagings considered to be the most vulnerable . 
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Deeply concerned that understanding of human nature has been significantly modified by the rapid rise of developments in biotechnology as a science , particularly in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes , and that indigenous people are most vulnerable to the risk of being singled out for human genetic research and human gene patenting by the biotechnology industry ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
After extensive consultations , the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that , since no additional resources had been authorized under resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) , the needs of vulnerable groups would be met outside the framework of the resolution .  I am glad to report that the United Nations has been creative in preparing the plan for the three northern governorates and was able to increase the resources for some key sectors through reallocations within the total amount of funds available .  
In approving the new distribution plan , I have informed the Government that the United Nations accepts the Government 's assurances as a commitment that the necessary additional resources will be available for vulnerable groups in central and southern Iraq . I have also informed the Government that the United Nations will continue to observe the situation of such groups in the context of my responsibilities under resolutions 986 ( 1995 ) and 1111 ( 1997 ) to determine and report on the adequacy of resources to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population .  
The Special Rapporteur affirmed that , owing to their double marginalization as women and as migrants , women migrant workers might easily find themselves in situations in which they were vulnerable to violence and abuse , especially since women migrant workers dominated the informal labour market of most countries , working as domestic , industrial or agricultural labourers , or within the service industry . 
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty and the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society , and the creation of more and better jobs , requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
In resolution 1997 / 57 , section IX , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on the prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and other vulnerable groups , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
This structured programme of technical cooperation in the field of human rights involves the principal elements of the administration of justice and legal reform ; penitentiary administration ; training and institutional support ; and genocide response and vulnerable groups .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
Education was free at all levels and compulsory at the primary level , health care was provided free to all sectors of the population without exception , special attention being paid to vulnerable groups , and young people played an important part in the development and execution of development plans . 
Despite the collapse of rural infrastructure , the destruction of irrigation systems and the presence of mines in prime agricultural land , a number of projects are being implemented to support an increase in overall food production among settled farming communities , nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists , returnees and vulnerable groups .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1997 / 57 in which it requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect , all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
A second pre-requisite for effective warning is both the understanding by a vulnerable population of the hazards to which it may be exposed and an appreciation of the natural forces that can destroy elements of their economic livelihood and social well-being .  
These require organizational structures , information flows and decision-making protocols capable of acting effectively at both national and local levels to monitor and forecast hazards at those levels , and to generate risk scenarios that can indicate the potential impacts of an impending hazard event on specifically identified vulnerable groups and sectors .  
Insecurity in the northern and western regions of Rwanda , where numerous vulnerable populations are located , reduced the access of humanitarian workers to the areas , with accompanying reductions in the reach and scope of humanitarian programmes .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Noting that , despite the successful conclusion of the inter-Tajik talks and the efforts of the Government of Tajikistan to allocate limited resources to returning refugees and displaced persons , the economic situation in Tajikistan remains bleak and essential social services are largely dysfunctional , making a large percentage of the population extremely vulnerable ,  
Other replies contained favourable views : the appointment of a special rapporteur was seen , in the light of article 2 of the Covenant , as a way to overcome obstacles to the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to protect vulnerable groups such as migrants and minorities .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
We believe that serious consideration must be given to the immediate cancellation of the bilateral , multilateral and commercial debts of the least developed countries , without imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable .  
Targeting policies at the most vulnerable groups of society children , women , the elderly , the disadvantaged , the poor , the disabled is , moreover , a prerequisite for the successful realization of social justice , equity and respect for human dignity .  
The health component of such plans should address the key objectives spelled out in chapter 6 of Agenda 21 , namely ( a ) meeting primary health care needs , particularly in rural areas , ( b ) control of communicable diseases , ( c ) protecting vulnerable groups , ( d ) meeting the urban health challenge and ( e ) reducing health risks from environmental pollution and hazards .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country .  
There should also be special attention given to promoting social protection for vulnerable or marginalized groups of women workers , especially international female migrant workers , women in transition economies adversely affected by economic reforms and long-term unemployed older women workers .  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
The criteria for sustainable development should include better protection of all human rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as protection of the most vulnerable and impoverished .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Convinced that small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of global climate change and sea level rise , and that tropical storms , the El Ni �� phenomenon and drought have resulted in the inundation of some islands and have caused serious loss of resources in their exclusive economic zones , economic infrastructure , human settlements and culture ,  
In resolution 1997 / 33 , on the protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , States were urged , in collaboration and through the community , to promote a supportive and enabling environment for women , children and other vulnerable groups , by addressing underlying prejudices and inequalities through community dialogue , specially designed social and health services , and support community groups .  
The entire northern third of the country is hostile to Islamabad , and the more the northern forces continue their advance into Taliban-controlled territory , the greater will be the destabilizing consequences for Pakistan , already fragile and vulnerable from guns , drugs , corruption , ethnic killings and religious conflict . 
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development are essentially the same as those that are relevant at the national level : creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations , establishment of open , fair , equitable and transparent international regimes ; respect for and non-discriminatory application of the rules of the game so as to create equal opportunities and a level playing field for all ; and protection of the weakest and the most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
The Convention should be incorporated in the curricula of all educational institutions , and present initiatives to reach those vulnerable groups who are illiterate or without formal education should be pursued and further strengthened , with the cooperation of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and other organizations active in this field .  
With regard to the implementation of article 4 of the Convention , the Committee notes the lack of adequate legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure the full implementation of childrens economic , social and cultural rights to the maximum extent of the State partys available resources , in particular for the most vulnerable children , including girls , children with disabilities , abandoned children , children born out of wedlock , children from single-parent families , children victims of abuse and / or exploitation , and nomadic and refugee children .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
In the past few months , UNICEF emergency interventions had been focused on ensuring protection and care of the most vulnerable children , including tracing and reunification of unaccompanied children ; provision of primary health care services and of safe water , sanitation and hygiene education , particularly in the camps for refugees and displaced people ; monitoring children 's nutritional status and supporting therapeutic feeding ; and provision of emergency supplies .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
The Committee was concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery and the relevant ministries to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
While it is not for the Government itself to build or finance the housing units required to satisfy all of the demand in the country , it should make every effort to ensure that a fair share of the resources available is utilized for making low _ cost housing available to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of society , and enabling the private sector to contribute to that endeavour .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
The international community and States should take all the necessary measures to protect the rights of vulnerable segments of the population and give very serious consideration to holding a large _ scale discussion on the practice of embargoes and economic sanctions which are imposed on States and have adverse consequences for the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights of the segments concerned ;  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
The phenomenon of protracted and growing displacement , warfare that targets civilians and demolishes communities , and the disintegration of political , institutional and economic structures in crisis countries all point to the need for a better understanding of crises and their adverse impact on vulnerable communities .  
The memorandum of understanding has paved the way for increased levels of cooperation , including discussion of possible joint missions to assess and address the needs of separated minors and other groups identified as particularly vulnerable and the establishment of common standards and practices .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
It established a national commission , composed of representatives of the federal Government , communities and regions and with the collaboration of non-governmental organizations , to elaborate a comprehensive strategy with a view to strengthening social integration of the most vulnerable groups of society .  
The Government has also set in motion the Social Solidarity Network , a strategy that aims at improving the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of the population and initiating large social programmes through joint efforts of State-owned and territorial institutions , non-governmental organizations and the civil society .  
We recognize that poverty , unemployment and other obstacles to human development , such as civil strife and war , as well as crime and social injustices , render our States and societies vulnerable to transnational organized crime and corruption ; and we are , therefore , resolved to undertake and intensify all necessary steps and measures to address such problems , with the cooperation and support of the international community .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Civil peace and security are endangered by the combined impact of various forms of violence and conflict between ethnic , religious , linguistic and other groups , the rise of xenophobia and aggressive nationalism , of fanaticism and fundamentalism of different kinds , of terrorism and organized crime , exclusion and discrimination directed against vulnerable groups within societies , proceeding from a culture of violence and war .  
The variables were standardized and equal weights assigned to them in the computation of the composite vulnerability index , which confirmed that small island developing States were generally more vulnerable than larger countries . 
Womens social position , marital status , class , or membership in particularly vulnerable groups , such as refugee or migrant women , rural or urban poor women , are often linked to de facto , and sometimes also to de jure , discrimination .  
It was emphasized by one speaker that poverty , unemployment , social injustice and unfair and imbalanced trade and economic relations should be considered factors that rendered States vulnerable to organized transnational crimes .  
Developing countries , with their diverse agro-climatic situation , high and unstable mountains , perennial waterways coupled with peak seasonal discharge , as well as arid and semi-arid ecological conditions , are vulnerable to drought and desertification .  
It includes citizen initiative and participation , the sharing of responsibility between the central State authorities and autonomous State or private bodies , incentives to creativity and responses based very clearly on the specific needs of vulnerable groups .  
The Government 's social security policy is to meet the basic and special needs of the disadvantaged , including the financially vulnerable , the elderly and the severely disabled .  
The representative of Cuba said that orthodox liberalization and deregulation policies had been catastrophic for the East Asian economies , which were as vulnerable to external factors as they were attractive for international capital flows . 
Social development is impossible when basic essential social services are denied to the civilian population and where vulnerable members of the community are indiscriminately exposed to bombing , summary execution , rape and the threat of landmines .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
The Assembly had mandated UNCTAD to undertake analysis of current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups . 
There is thus a need for strengthened international cooperation with a view to enhancing the legal protection of vulnerable groups in internal conflict , to improve international monitoring and to promote an active role of the international community in protecting human rights and fundamental humanitarian standards in such situations .  
There is a common thread running through the preceding statements that makes unequivocally clear one of the characteristics of the recent armed conflicts that have led to political or military action by this Organization : the fact that their first and principal target has been the civilian population , in particular its most vulnerable sectors children , women , the elderly , the sick , refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
All population groups are covered by a coherent State health _ care system , with special attention being paid to women , pregnant women and parturients , children under 14 and other particularly vulnerable population groups , such as the elderly and the disabled . 
In light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to continue undertaking all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of its available resources , including through international cooperation , to continue ensuring that sufficient budgetary allocations are provided to social services for children and that particular attention is paid to the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
The absence of a consolidated text of the various provisions tends to inhibit focused and systematic attention to migrants as a specific vulnerable social group , and makes the tasks of the relevant advocacy bodies more difficult .  
Prompt and decisive action was needed to halt the decline in living standards in countries which had fallen prey to the global financial crisis , and Governments must enact policies to expand economic opportunities quickly for disadvantaged households and communities , and make them less vulnerable to future shocks .  
Therefore , international efforts to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries should be intensified through the implementation of an information strategy on aspects of globalization relating to social justice and the understanding among peoples that strengthened assistance to developing countries , vulnerable population groups and the victims of armed conflicts , human rights violations and natural disasters . 
Second , it was important to understand that , in addition to international instruments , the value systems of individual societies represented another basic means of protecting children in armed conflicts , since one of the main objectives of any society had always been the protection of children , who were its most vulnerable members .  
When the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's painful transition to independence in the 1960s saw the birth of the first armed militias , political leaders , including those in the United Nations , did not gauge what the refugee problem would become 40 years later , with refugee camps transformed into military training and arms-supply facilities , compromising any good-faith attempt to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable affected populations .  
The UNCTAD regular programme of technical cooperation will be coordinated to ensure an appropriate balance among developing regions with priority assigned to the specific needs of the least developed countries and other countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies . 
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
It has been widely recognized , nationally and internationally , that the existence of strong and transparent institutions is a prerequisite for an inclusive society based on the rule of law , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and democratic participation , which takes into account the special needs of vulnerable and disadvantages groups .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
To secure progressively , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
Women with mental disabilities are particularly vulnerable , while there is limited understanding , in general , of the broad range of risks to mental health to which women are disproportionately susceptible as a result of gender discrimination , violence , poverty , armed conflict , dislocation and other forms of social deprivation . 
Physical accessibility implies that adequate food must be accessible to everyone , including physically vulnerable individuals , such as infants and young children , elderly people , the physically disabled , the terminally ill and persons with persistent medical problems , including the mentally ill .  
Recent global conferences have highlighted human-centred economic growth ; basic physical infrastructures ; fundamental social services ; access to work ; land and credit ; empowerment of women ; food security ; natural resources regeneration ; good governance ; and vulnerable groups as the priorities in efforts to achieve the overarching objective to eradicate poverty .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
As a result , Hong Kong developed a light , specialized and efficient manufacturing base which , nonetheless , lacks technological depth and is therefore vulnerable to rising labour costs .  
For example , in Thailand , women working on family-owned land under contract to multinational companies earned cash income for the first time after years of unpaid labour in intensive rice cultivation . 15 However , the vertical integration of the agricultural sector which comes with the involvement of multinational corporations makes rural household food security vulnerable to market fluctuations . 
In the area of poverty alleviation , special emphasis was given to assisting Governments in enhancing the quality of life of the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including children , youth , older persons and disabled persons , through the provision of policy-oriented research and guidelines and the convening of intergovernmental meetings aimed at forging agreements on priority issues , policy approaches and regional benchmarks and their monitoring .  
An entire new cluster of WHO technical programmes has also been established to promote health in the context of sustainable human development , including a renewed emphasis on reducing malnutrition and improving management of environmental risks to human health , integrating health dimensions into poverty reduction programmes and protecting vulnerable populations in situations of crisis and post-crisis ; promoting the synergy between health and human rights constitutes an additional priority .  
Took note of the information provided by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on how to sign / ratify the Tampere Convention which provides a legal framework for the use of telecommunications in international humanitarian assistance ; ( i ) Noted that the considerable recent advances in seasonal weather and climate predictions , including of such phenomena as El Nio , enable improved preparedness of vulnerable communities against natural disasters .  
The Committee made an important point by emphasizing that in considering sanctions , it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing lite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law , and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .  
Contrary to what the aggressors are doing in the occupied territories , where civilians , including vulnerable persons , are massacred , raped , tortured , deported and robbed of their personal possessions and property , the Government of National Salvation , mindful of its international commitments , is protecting Rwandan , Ugandan and Burundian Tutsis in appropriate sites .  
The forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 which deal with international humanitarian law provides an opportunity for States which have signed and become party to the Conventions to reflect upon the degree of applicability of the provisions governing conduct of hostilities and respect for the civilian population , including vulnerable persons considered as non-combatants .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .  
The country 's narrow economic base , with tourism and fisheries contributing about 40 per cent of the gross domestic product , leaves the country excessively vulnerable to external shocks .  
As regards protecting families and vulnerable social sectors , we could mention the development , now under way , of a national family code , the strengthening and continuation of a programme of education in responsible parenting and the establishment of regulatory and legislative measures to protect the elderly , the disabled , and marginal populations .  
Concentrations of population in major urban centres ( megacities ) , many of which are located in hazard-prone areas in developing countries , are highly vulnerable to natural and technological hazards due to dependence on complex infrastructures and the occupation of marginal land .  
Expressing concern that the world is increasingly being threatened by large-scale natural disasters which will have long _ term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ,  
Similarly , the recommendation regarding the civil society and non-governmental organizations , encouraging their greater participation , especially of those groups that represent the vulnerable sections , such as the poor , the homeless and the unemployed , and the public interest ( e.g . consumer , environmental , human rights and women 's organizations ) , in the local and national decision-making , would be equally important .  
If providing food to poor families in all parts of the country is given equal value in a financially expensive programme of food security , the female children in backward villages may continue to be deprived , if social reforms are not pursued effectively . most vulnerable . 
Such a system should cover all children up to the age of 18 years , with specific emphasis on those who are particularly vulnerable , including children with disabilities , children living in poverty , children in the juvenile justice system , children of single _ parent families , children born out of wedlock , sexually abused children and institutionalized children .  
In light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to continue undertaking all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of available resources , including international cooperation , to continue ensuring that sufficient budgetary allocations are provided to social services for children and that particular attention is paid to the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
Of particular concern are certain vulnerable groups of children , including children with disabilities , particularly mental disabilities , girls , particularly Vidomegons , children living in remote rural areas , children living in extreme poverty , children living and / or working on the street , refugee and asylum _ seeking children , children in the juvenile justice system , children born out of wedlock , children of incestuous relations , and institutionalized children .  
Concern is expressed at the lack of a systematic , comprehensive and disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data _ collection mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention , especially the most sensitive , such as child abuse or ill _ treatment , but also in relation to all vulnerable groups of children , especially girls , children with disabilities , children living in rural areas , children living in poverty and refugee children .  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , [ and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ] [ and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ] ,  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
" The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
Ensuring access to basic social services for the unreached , the vulnerable and the most disadvantaged members of society is not only morally imperative but also economically rational , eradicating the worst manifestation of poverty and laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and productivity gains in the future .  
In addition to cash transfers for destitute families and children , the chronic sick , elderly and unemployed , assistance should be provided for developing capacities through the provision of basic services , skill training and retraining for the changing employment and market demand , micro-credit facilities , and other productive assets to help to broaden the income support base for the poor and vulnerable groups ;  
The recent economic crisis in some countries in the region has worsened further the situation for many , especially the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including women , children , older persons , disabled persons , minority groups and migrant workers .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
Combined efforts of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , should help countries to enhance the performance of macroeconomic management , achieve greater coherence in the policies affecting economic , financial , social and environmental aspects , and protect the most vulnerable groups , and thus give the concerned country an opportunity to use this support to further its national goals while integrating better into the global economy .  
Measures which should be taken to ensure the right to health are understood to be effective administration of available resources to improve health , establishment of health policies with an emphasis on prevention , increased primary health care , special attention to the health needs of the most vulnerable and free health care for the most economically disadvantaged .  
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
Efforts must be made to harmonize economic and social development , achieve a more equitable distribution of income , promote gender equity and implement proactive social policies , with special emphasis on the needs of the most vulnerable groups , such as children , women , the disabled , the elderly , indigenous persons and the unemployed .  
The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
C Analysing the impact , both positive and negative , of substantial reduction or elimination of export subsidies on developing countries , with particular attention being paid to the special concerns of LDCs , net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) and other small and vulnerable economies .  
Recognizing the continuing efforts of debtor countries , despite the great social cost involved , to pursue economic reform , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes aimed at achieving stability , raising domestic savings and investments , reducing inflation , improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development , including the eradication of poverty as well as the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations ,  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
This could be achieved if the international community would : recognize the special situation and needs of African countries , particularly supply constraints ; apply differential treatment in favour of developing countries , including small and vulnerable economies , in a concrete and comprehensive fashion ; and remove all barriers facing the trade of African countries , in particular of the least developed countries .  
Governments , vulnerable to the threats of withdrawal from transnational companies and to political pressure from voters who were not prepared to change their lifestyles , had difficulty in maintaining social standards and affording the initial cost of moving to environmentally friendly technologies and behaviours .  
However reasonable the original managerial decision to make a loan or acquire an asset , and however justified its initial classification as low-risk by banking supervisors , the loan is vulnerable to a possible eventual deterioration in its status . 17 So long as cycles of financial boom and bust are features of the economic system , so also will be unforeseeable deteriorations in the status of many bank assets . 
The objectives were to achieve nutritional coverage of the most vulnerable sector , reduce maternal and infant mortality , and ensure the supply of clean drinking water ; eliminate female illiteracy in rural areas and provide vocational training in urban areas , and educate women about their rights ; and reduce poverty , provide small loans to womens rural cooperatives , and increase employment .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
Along with domestic efforts , the international environment must also be improved , as it could have a direct impact on developing countries , which were fragile and especially vulnerable to external blows .  
A number of challenges lay ahead , including the achievement of a serious reduction in excess mortality and morbidity among the poor , which would require Governments to reallocate resources to activities that had proved to be effective and to focus on major diseases , such as malaria , HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis , and on the most vulnerable populations , particularly women .  
Among the many pressing needs are the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of child combatants ; the protection and safe return of internally displaced and refugee children ; the provision of humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations composed largely of women and children ; and the registration , protection and reunification of unaccompanied or orphaned children and children in foster families .  
Those developments had taken place despite the coercive economic sanctions imposed on the Libyan people in the early 1990s , which had caused it enormous losses and had impeded plans and programmes designed to meet the needs of vulnerable groups in society .  
The United Nations must provide some direction in the debate on the complex issues surrounding royalties for genetic material , and should help to fashion an international technological architecture that encouraged technological advances , but not at the cost of marginalizing the poorest and most vulnerable .  
Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in Iraq , which particularly affects certain vulnerable groups , such as children , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
The growing openness of some economies made them more vulnerable to adverse external effects and promoted the spread of local economic troubles to other regions of the world , as the recent financial crisis in Asia had demonstrated .  
Globalization was the newest form of economic colonialism ; it made possible the efficient exploitation of vulnerable nations in the name of free markets and allowed transnational capitalists to rampage through the developing world , sometimes with the connivance , and even the active participation , of the rich elite of those poor countries . 
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Issues addressed with regard to the linkages between poverty and various vulnerable groups , including indigenous peoples , minorities , migrant workers and persons affected by AIDS , included social exclusion and marginalization , the exploitation of natural resources , transnational corporations and the impact of their activities on the enjoyment of the rights of communities concerned by such activities , as well as the overall policies of host Governments . 
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
They should promote greater institutional convergence between developed and developing countries and assist the latter to establish the physical infrastructure necessary for their economic and social development , including by supporting social safety nets to protect the socially vulnerable and those marginalized by globalization and providing access to basic education , health and good drinking water .  
Urges also the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , provision of basic social services , poverty eradication , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of youth , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation , respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;

Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts , in order to promote international financial stability , and to this end to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
The need for greater support for the developing countries had to be seen in the context of four important realities : firstly , unless effective measures were taken at national and global levels to regulate , supervise and control financial activities and international capital flows , financial instability would continue to recur with increasing frequency and ferocity , destroying the most fragile economies and vulnerable populations and crippling their efforts to eradicate poverty .  
Recognizing the continuing efforts of debtor countries , despite the great social cost involved , to pursue economic reform , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes aimed at achieving stability , raising domestic savings and investments , reducing inflation , improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development , including the eradication of poverty as well as the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations ,  
Under the authority of the national committee on the use of illicit drugs , the relevant national institutions had focused their activities on human resource development , scientific research , periodic evaluation and the provision of services to the most vulnerable sectors of society , including young people .  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts to promote international financial stability and , to this end , to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crises in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;  
Humanitarian agencies fear increased suffering of the most vulnerable , particularly refugees , internationally displaced persons , the disabled , children , the chronically ill , urban elderly and social cases .  
This consists of consolidating the activities of associations working with the elderly , strengthening work in the specialized medical and paramedical areas , validating the role of older people by benefiting from their experience and knowledge and providing permanent assistance to 3 , 100 vulnerable older people in the context of the national programme for the protection of older people .  
Similarly , in the Veracruz declaration , signed on 19 March 1999 in Mexico , the Rio Group reaffirmed its ongoing commitment to implementing economic and social programmes designed to generate favourable conditions for the definitive integration of the vulnerable sectors of the population into the development process and to eliminate structural imbalances , in particular , conditions of poverty and marginalization .  
Since then , Egypt has embarked upon reforming its economy and has implemented structural adjustment programmes to achieve economic growth aimed at improving the living standards of the Egyptian people while establishing social safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable groups of our society .  
New or restored democracies need : fair treatment with respect to the debts they inherited from anti-democratic governments ; preferential access to major world markets ; concessionary credit policies by international financial institutions ; cooperation in the economic , technological and educational spheres ; and the advantages to be gained from aid and assistance programmes by international organizations for our countries most vulnerable populations .  
It has weighty legal , political and strategic implications , since it affects one of the vital organs of the United Nations , entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security and thereby vulnerable to the subtle interplay of the interests of the Powers , sometimes to the detriment of the very cause of maintaining international peace and security that it is supposed to promote .  
As a subregion that is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters resulting from violent tropical cyclones , El Nio , tsunamis , tidal waves , droughts , brush fires and earthquakes , we are committed to supporting the remarkable role played by the United Nations and its response system , including its engagement with many intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , in the delivery of much-needed relief assistance to our peoples .  
Despite the economic growth that began under the influence of the structural adjustment programmes combined with the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 , the problems of survival experienced by poor and vulnerable households were aggravated and the harmful effects of the crisis have been very much felt in some social sectors education , employment and health and have to an extent compromised the major gains made in previous decades .  
Although the number of people in Malta living below the acceptable national standard of living is about 1 per cent of the population , the Government continues to give special importance to social services and , within the constraints of a small island economy , social welfare programmes now provide an adequate safety net even for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged .  
The problem of HIV AIDS is of prime importance in the policy of the Government of Honduras , and the focus of reproductive rights and of attention to priority vulnerable population groups is therefore principally on promoting low-risk behaviour , through a sustained and systematic information and education campaign , and through increased medical , counselling , hospital and laboratory services for sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ,  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
I have a clear duty also to insist that the intellectual debate on how to strengthen the sustainable development prospects for a uniquely fragile and vulnerable group of countries is informed by the most current thinking , produced by those who fully understand the complex circumstances of the countries for which they prescribe solutions .  
Yet at the same time we stated candidly that the islands were increasingly vulnerable and that their precarious situation , if left unattended , would soon mirror similar critical circumstances in Africa , the least developed countries and the landlocked developing countries .  
Among these efforts we would like to mention the national economic conference , held in Bata in 1997 , which had as its objectives the involvement of all segments of society in defining the priorities for national development in all sectors , the designing of strategies for such development in the short , medium and long term and the rational use of oil resources to meet the needs of the most vulnerable sectors and to promote productivity for the sake of the harmonious development for our country .  
The need for universal commitment to such preventive measures has become more pressing due to the isolation and oceanic location of some small island developing States and their total dependence on a marine and limited terrestrial base , which render them highly vulnerable to contamination from such waste .  
The Committee notes that since 1994 , in addressing the budget deficits by slashing social expenditure , the State party has not paid sufficient attention to the adverse consequences for the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the Canadian population as a whole , and by vulnerable groups in particular .  
The Committee is concerned that the State party did not take into account the Committees 1993 major concerns and recommendations when it adopted policies at federal , provincial and territorial levels which exacerbated poverty and homelessness among vulnerable groups during a time of strong economic growth and increasing affluence .  
The Guidelines follow three broad and interconnected approaches , namely ( a ) improvement of governmental capacity for acknowledging the Governments responsibility for multisectoral coordination ; ( b ) widespread reform of laws and legal support services with a focus on the status of women , children and vulnerable groups ; and ( c ) support for increased private sector and community participation in the response to HIV AIDS .  
Guideline 5 encourages States to enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws to protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors ; ensure privacy and confidentiality ; ensure ethics in research involving human subjects ; and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies when the laws are breached .  
To be sure , projects addressing longer-term development needs should be pursued , but in parallel with the continued provision of basic humanitarian relief to those in need and especially to the most vulnerable groups among them , such as the elderly , the disabled and women heads of household , who are likely to continue to need humanitarian assistance regardless of the pace of development .  
Further standards are likely to be elaborated and mechanisms established at the international level , especially to ensure that genetic research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human rights and dignity , particularly of vulnerable groups of people . 
The CMAs Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics , which were developed in 1993 , are unique in that they represent the only available internationally recognized code of medical ethics to ( a ) deal with conditions of practice in developing countries ; ( b ) set out the ethical obligations of health professionals to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community ; and ( c ) be annotated throughout with references to corresponding internationally recognized human rights instruments .  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
Completion and implementation as called for under article 6 of the Convention on Biodiversity , of comprehensive national biodiversity strategy and action plans that , by individual country , ( i ) assess the state of knowledge on biodiversity ; ( ii ) identify vulnerable and endangered ecosystems and species ; ( iii ) identify activities and processes that endanger biodiversity ; and ( iv ) contain strategies for the protection and sustainable use of island biodiversity .  
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , administrative or technical opportunities for criminal organizations to commit profitable crimes and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
To secure , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer disproportionately from reproductive ill health .  
The Commission also recognized that its discussions and the analysis of the trade issues by the secretariat as well as the technical cooperation activities undertaken had made a positive contribution to the effective integration of developing countries , particularly LDCs and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , as well as the economies in transition , into the international trading system .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Concerned also that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Urges also the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , provision of basic social services , poverty eradication , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of youth , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation , respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
The continued imposition by international financial institutions upon some developing countries of policies for structural adjustment can have profoundly negative impacts on the poor and vulnerable .  
That neoracism was directed against vulnerable social groups such as migrant workers , refugees , ethnic or religious minorities and indigenous populations , who were reproached for being different ; that difference , instead of being celebrated as a source of richness and complementarity , became a synonym for rejection and discrimination .  
The Government , which has a minimal credit limit and is determined to abide by established budgetary norms , is making enormous financial sacrifices so as not to pass on the rising costs of petroleum products to the vulnerable segments of the population .  
Human rights education an effective tool to prevent human rights violations should be understood to cover the whole range of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the right to development , as well as those of vulnerable groups .  
In order to bring about satisfactory political , social and cultural integration , it was necessary to meet the needs of vulnerable groups in difficult circumstances such as women , children , the poor , displaced persons and refugees .  
Women and children become vulnerable to trafficking because of social inequality and the vast economic disparity within States and between rich and poor States , even though considerable efforts have gone into standardsetting to combat this evil .  
In conclusion , the representative emphasized Indias determined , concrete and sustained efforts to eliminate poverty and social disability and empower the poor and vulnerable .  
They stressed the special importance of cooperation in alternative development , including the better integration of the most vulnerable sectors involved in the illicit drug market into legal and viable economic activities .  
Other central regions and western and southeastern regions were also affected , but the economic and social consequences in those regions are less severe than in the more vulnerable northeastern and eastcentral regions .  
Considering ways in which early warning systems for extreme weather events might be strengthened or established in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to help address the climatechange related requirements of particularly vulnerable countries ;  
The extreme poverty faced by 80 per cent of the population , recent poor harvests , severe drought , and the collapse of the social safety net , public health , sanitation and educational systems render the achievements of the peace process extremely vulnerable .  
Strengthening existing [ and , where needed , establishing ] early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .  
An open , rulebased , equitable , secure , nondiscriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system that accorded preferential treatment to the weak and vulnerable would be vital to that end .  
In short , although globalization offers enormous potential for human development in the twentyfirst century , its current benefits are unevenly distributed while its costs are concentrated among the poorest and most vulnerable .  
It is equally intolerable that the intense fighting is hindering the access of humanitarian agencies to many regions , particularly the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo , depriving vulnerable populations of the precious assistance they so sorely need .  
While this debt may be manageable under rapid growth circumstances and in an otherwise favourable economic environment , their situation leaves them very vulnerable to abrupt changes in internal or external factors .  
We also recommend that positive consideration be given to the Secretary-Generals practical and action-oriented recommendations , in particular those that are targeted at enhancing the capacity of national Governments and the international community to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law ; improving engagement by the Security Council and others with a view to obtaining access to vulnerable populations for humanitarian operations ; and developing clear criteria and procedures for the identification and separation of armed elements in situations of massive population displacement .  
While welcoming the fact that access to vulnerable populations is improving , we note that faltering security remains a constant threat to crucial humanitarian and rehabilitation efforts , as illustrated by the deplorable attack on six workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) in April .  
My delegation has also subscribed to the premise that for sanctions to be effective , they must be implemented within a prescribed time frame and be subject to close monitoring and periodic review in order to ensure their continued usefulness and validity , as well as to evaluate their impact on vulnerable populations and neighbouring States .  
The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .  
In the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups for instance indigenous people , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with HIV / AIDS .  
In addition to the five major themes on its agenda , the World Conference should also take up other important issues , especially ways to reduce ethnic tensions and to prevent ethnic and racial conflicts ; the economic impact of racism ; discrimination against migrant workers ; the question of asylum-seekers , refugees and disabled persons ; trafficking in human beings ; assaults on minorities and vulnerable groups ; the rights of indigenous peoples ; and the role of the Internet and of communications technologies .  
In light of article 4 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that , the State party undertake a study on the impact of the Governments budgetary resources allocated for children and their families in order to assess their effectiveness and to develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure the full implementation of the economic , social and cultural rights of children to the maximum extent of available resources , in particular at the local level and with respect to children belonging to the most vulnerable groups in society .  
The Committee recommends that the State party allocate appropriate resources and develop comprehensive policies and programmes to improve health infrastructure , to increase the number of trained health and welfare , including mental health , professionals , to improve the health situation of children , to facilitate greater access to primary health services , to reduce the incidence of maternal , child and infant mortality , to prevent and combat malnutrition , especially in vulnerable and disadvantaged groups of children , and to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation that all measures to implement economic , social and cultural rights should be undertaken to the maximum extent of . . . available resources in the light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention and that particular attention be paid to effective budget mobilization and allocation , in particular for the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
Particular attention should be paid by the discussions under both sub-themes to the position and special vulnerability of children who have been marginalized or discriminated against on the basis of their ethnic origin of economic status who can be , for example , singled out in schools for bullying or degrading treatment by teachers or be more vulnerable to violence within the family that escapes detection by the normal monitoring systems ( for example for families that are homeless or illegal migrants ) .  
Six different approaches to caring for orphaned and vulnerable children were described : ( a ) informal , non-statutory foster care ; ( b ) community-based support structures ; ( c ) home-based care and support ; ( d ) unregistered residential care ; ( e ) statutory adoption and foster care ; and ( f ) statutory residential care .  
The Centre had also initiated preparatory work on a new programme activity in crime prevention to promote a culture of lawfulness and to assist national and local governments in protecting vulnerable groups at risk of being recruited by organized crime , in particular through educational and civic programmes .  
Also affirm in particular that the victims right to have access to justice is of special importance to victims of racial discrimination in the light of their vulnerable situation , socially , culturally and economically , and that the principle of equality of victims in legal systems is meaningless unless it is accompanied by affirmative action ;  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;  
Trade is the most important mechanism for most if not all small island developing States to expand domestic savings and finance their various development processes especially because they seriously lack comparative advantages and economies of scale , being vulnerable and dependent on a small number of export commodities , predominantly agriculture , light manufacturing and underdeveloped service-based sectors , to drive much-needed foreign exchange earnings , employment and development . 
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Request the operational programmes and agencies of the United Nations , financial and development institutions , in accordance with their mandates , to assign higher priority and provide more funding to projects in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination , and to include such vulnerable groups at the stage of the development and implementation of projects concerning them ;  
Urge States to consider taking special measures to protect especially vulnerable persons and groups which may be subject to multiple forms of discrimination on account of their gender , age , national origin , sexual orientation , social or economic status , physical or mental disability , state of health , religious belief or any other condition liable to give rise to discrimination , including racial discrimination ;  
Also invite them to ensure their full enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in particular women , children and vulnerable groups , so that persons who admit to an HIV infection , those presumably infected and other persons affected are protected against violence , stigmatization , discrimination , unemployment and other negative consequences which may be compounded by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
They therefore include commitments on amending the legal framework , strengthening and decentralizing the Ministry of Labour and Social Security , providing occupational training and education , improving social security and expanding its coverage , protecting the most vulnerable categories of workers and promoting collective bargaining and consensus methods of settling labour disputes .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Recognizing that care , support and treatment can contribute to effective prevention through increased acceptance of voluntary and confidential counselling and testing , and by keeping people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups in close contact with health-care systems and facilitating their access to information , counselling and preventive supplies ;  
Affirming that beyond the key role played by communities , strong partnerships among Governments , the United Nations system , intergovernmental organizations , people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups , medical , scientific and educational institutions , non-governmental organizations , the business sector including generic and research-based pharmaceutical companies , trade unions , media , parliamentarians , foundations , community organizations , faith-based organizations and traditional leaders are important ;  
Urge the international community , particularly donor countries , civil society , as well as the private sector to complement effectively national programmes to support programmes for children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV / AIDS in affected regions , in countries at high risk and to direct special assistance to sub-Saharan Africa ;  
Urges States to design or reinforce , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies , as well as other preventive measures , against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers , including migrant workers , persons of migrant origin and foreign workers , who are vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or victims of illegal trafficking .  
Urges States to promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
To guarantee and promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;

Calls upon Calls uponStrongly recommends to participating States to introduce , or encourage the introduction of , or reinforce , human rights education , including promoting anti-racism , with a view to combating prejudices which lead to racial discrimination and to promoting understanding , tolerance and friendship between different racial or ethnic groups in school curricula and in institutions of higher education and to support public formal and non-formal education programmes designed to promote cultural diversity and self-esteem of vulnerable groups ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
This should include mechanisms for protection when third parties evict a vulnerable group from their bases of subsistence and mechanisms of punishment and compensation in evictions already effected ; the guarantee of security of land tenure and other productive resources ; effective regulation of workers rights ; the guarantee of non-discrimination against women , in the area of work as well as in relation to ownership of property and productive resources ; and the guarantee of traditional rights of indigenous communities in relation to their natural resources ; ( c ) Obligation to fulfil .  
The consumption of food in sufficient quantity and adequate quality to ensure adequate growth of babies and children , as well as women , elderly and other vulnerable groups , must be monitored at the local level ( communities , municipalities , districts and so on ) by the health and social welfare authorities ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Reaffirms the need for strengthening an international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and within its framework of action ;  
Convinced that human rights education and information is in the best interests of particularly vulnerable segments of society , such as children , youth , women , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with HIV / AIDs and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing that low-lying and other small island countries , countries with low-lying coastal , arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods , drought and desertification , and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change ,  
To protect the poor in the short run and sustain progress already achieved towards the international development goals , Fund-supported programmes continue to include social safety nets to cushion the negative impact of economic reforms and external shocks on vulnerable groups .  
In a multi-faction conflict , such as that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , experience has shown that , in order to gain meaningful and regular access to vulnerable populations within different combat zones , where front lines are shifting from day to day , the consent of many parties has to be obtained at the local , regional , national and international levels .  They may include a range of armed groups and other non-State actors with often diverse or obscure political , economic and strategic goals .  
I encourage the Security Council to conduct more frequent fact-finding missions to conflict areas with a view to identifying the specific requirements for humanitarian assistance , in particular obtaining safe and meaningful access to vulnerable populations .  In view of the prevalence of civil wars among todays conflicts , a structured dialogue with armed groups is indispensable for reaching and protecting vulnerable populations in times of war ( see paras . 30-32 and 48-50 ) .  
Such projects have included peoples sensitization campaigns on indigenous people issues in Chile ; training sessions for school teachers and representatives of social groups in Chile ; the establishment of a centre in Mexico where human rights violations can be reported and which provides legal assistance to vulnerable groups , such as rural populations , street children , prisoners and people living with HIV / AIDS . France Liberts has also been advocating against the death penalty ; a CD-ROM against racism was also produced and distributed among schools and for public awareness purposes . 
The least developed countries committed to pursuing balance policies that sought to limit transmission of external shock into the domestic economy while promoting gradual liberalization , and developing safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of the population against the consequences of external shocks .  
Among the most significant aspects , the Government emphasized the importance given to the effective implementation of international accords on the matter , the fact that a lack of internal legislation should not hinder the protection of internationally recognized human rights , the provision of non-discrimination and equality of all persons , and the adoption of sanctions against the abuse and ill-treatment of certain vulnerable groups .  
Despite repeated calls for a change in the current international economic , trade and financial system , which did not meet the needs of the developing countries , especially those of the most vulnerable , no specific conclusions had yet been reached .  
This is a solid basis for continuing work in this area , which is steadily increasing in importance in a more interdependent and vulnerable world in which our democratic values are still constantly being challenged by undemocratic and violent acts .  
Call upon all States , consistent with applicable international standards , to take or continue to take measures to strengthen asylum and render protection more effective including through the adoption and implementation of national refugee legislation and procedures for the determination of refugee status and for the treatment of asylum-seekers and refugees , giving special attention to vulnerable groups and individuals with special needs , including women , children and the elderly ;  
The international community must develop and improve efforts to integrate the most vulnerable social sectors involved in the illicit drug trade through legal and viable economic activities .  
Recognizing that the interrelationship of ageing and disability among women needs special attention , since lifelong neglect of womens health , social condition , poor nutrition and hard physical labour leaves them at and after menopause especially vulnerable to the risks of disabilities ,  
In January 2000 , the Security Council had recognized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic to which women and girls were especially vulnerable was a major threat to development and security , while the Commission on the Status of Women had emphasized that the full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights was of crucial importance in preventing the further spread of the disease .

To establish the increasingly necessary restrictions on the activities of certain non-State sectors currently acting as they please within the international framework , with a view to making them meet the national and international standards ensuring the protection of the basic rights , including human rights , of the most vulnerable sectors , in particular local workers , indigenous peoples , national or ethnic minorities and migrant workers ;  
To exert utmost efforts , in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights standards , to ensure that religious places , sites and shrines are fully respected and protected and to take additional measures in cases where they are vulnerable to desecration or destruction ;  
Two subregional and five national training workshops , taking into account the specific characteristics of the municipal systems , specifically on the promotion of community involvement in the definition of priorities and initiatives to reduce urban poverty ; facilitating the formation of social capital through a participatory process , incorporating the most vulnerable groups ; and increasing productivity in municipal investment through integrated programmes and action . 
Recognize that sexual violence during armed conflict constituting serious violations of international humanitarian law has been used as a tool of systematic forms of discrimination , abuse and genocide directed against racial or ethnic populations of non-combatants , and that race and gender combine to make women particularly vulnerable to certain types of violence , particularly sexual violence ;  
Strengthening existing and , where needed , establishing early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
As all types of economic targets are large in number and wide in scope ; are interrelated with one another ; and are under the control of different departments , some of which are also large in size ; are exposed to a large extent ; and are highly vulnerable owing to their state of production , operation , or utilization in peace time , it is difficult and costly to protect them .  Also it is unrealistic to protect them in an all-round way and hard to raise their protection efficiency .  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .  
Given this , and as proven by a series of recent local wars , in joint operations , aside from concentrating " capability " for a strike aimed at destroying the enemy 's " hardware " , such as personnel and arms , a belligerent will also have to concentrate superior forces and lethal weapons for a strike at the enemy 's weapons systems , information systems , logistic support systems , and especially at their vital and vulnerable points , in order to paralyze the enemy 's vital systems . 
Besides , a belligerent will have to mount both a " soft " strike and a " hard " strike at the enemy 's most threatening and vulnerable points , in order to destroy with information weapons , the enemy 's vital electronic equipment , which seem virtually immune to an electromagnetic strike , and damage with non-information weapons , the enemy 's electronic information carriers , through a " hard " strike .  
In order to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of vulnerable employee groups , trade unions must find out about their genuine conditions in a timely manner , present their reasonable requests to party and government leaders in a factual way , work energetically with party and government organs and relevant departments to solve their practical difficulties and problems , and make a success of ideological education for them with patience and meticulous attention .  
" The currency turmoil is telling us how and why our wealth could be cut by half because of weaknesses in the financial intermediation process in Asia which made us vulnerable to volatile speculative capital flows , " said Mr Yam .  
For example , foreign banks generally kept much smaller clearing balances because their lack of extensive retail networks made their liquidity less vulnerable to unpredictable swings , and because their dependence on interbank funding implied a higher opportunity cost in holding surplus liquidity than was faced by banks with a sizeable retail deposit base .  
I believe we should put in hand an action plan which will highlight the importance of the social and human aspects of economic development , and the needd to address the concerns of the most vulnerable groups of our community and the action plan should incorporate specific projects and programmes which will draw on the best practices in individual economies and on the appropriate advice from business and labour as well as from international organisations . 
Other than the above measures and services , we will enhance the functioning of the family through family life education and counselling , strengthen our existing services including emergency placement in residential care homes for elderly people in urgent need , social networking services for vulnerable elderly people , and referrals for medical , psychological and psychiatric treatment where necessary . 
Some 15% of the Government expenditure are spent on social welfare , ranging from financial assistance for the needy to a full range of welfare services for the aged , the disabled and other vulnerable groups . 
Dr Yeoh noted that apart from a safety net for the needy , the vulnerable and the disadvantaged , there was a range of preventive , developmental and support services , as well as remedial services for those who required assistance .  These include services for the elderly , the family , the youth , and the disabled .  
The Government is fully committed to providing quality welfare services for those in need .  There is now in place a safety net for the needy , the vulnerable and the disadvantaged .  In addition , there is a range of preventive , developmental and support services , as well as remedial services for those who are vulnerable and require such assistance .  These include services for the elderly , the family , the youth , and the disabled .  
" We shall ensure that the public fees will always be set at a level that is affordable by individual patients and there will always be a safety net to enable the financial vulnerable to continue to have equal access to quality medical care .  
During a chat with elderly citizens , Mr Tsang reassured them that there would always be a social safety net for Hong Kong 's senior citizens , the needy , the underprivileged and the vulnerable .  
It has also made developing countries more vulnerable to the impact of external economic turmoil and financial crises , as evidenced by the grave impact of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s on some Asian countries and regions . 
To wild dolphins , human is the biggest threat to them apart from shark , its main predator .  Thousands of dolphins die everyday in fishing nets around the world .  What 's more , the seriously polluted environment makes dolphins increasingly vulnerable .  In view of that , many scientists , naturalists and marine biologists devote their lifetime to study dolphins , their mode of communication , foraging and social behaviors so as to preserve these graceful and extraordinary creatures .  
" Cases in foreign countries showed that vulnerable infants like hospitalized prematures , low birth-weight and babies with underlying medical conditions can fall ill after consuming infant formula contaminated with the bacterium .  
Some people are still doing business much like their forefathers did generations before . Most of the narrow streets paved with granite slabs are now gone . Among Lukang 's fantastic construction features are the covered streets . They resemble ancient castles , so designed to make them less vulnerable to damage from strong winds and to offer protection from pillaging by bandits .  
" One shovelful could fill a tin can . " Today vast stretches of land have been developed , and pesticides have been badly overused in cultivated areas . Earthworms are highly vulnerable to sudden acute poisoning , " so that in many hectares of farmland , you could n't find a single worm , " says Huang , who worked hard with Kuo looking for the creatures in agricultural areas in Hsinchu .  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
Tomatoes ca n't stand high temperatures at night and they are vulnerable to bacterial wilt . AVRDC cultivation expert Chen Cheng-tsu , who has developed a number of excellent tomato strains , is untiring in his continued research on this highly nutritious fruit .  
With the trend towards the concentration of medical treatment in hospitals , rates of in-hospital infection have risen greatly . Lien Te-cheng , an attending physician in the Department of Respiratory Therapy at Taipei 's Veterans General Hospital , suggests that it is best if in-patients are discharged as soon as they are 70% recovered , because somebody just recovering from a major illness is much more vulnerable to any secondary infection which they might contract in hospital .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
Society sighs and shakes it collective head at this subgroup , which consists of disadvantaged individuals , often unemployed and / or single parents , stuck on the lower rungs both socially and economically . When faced with injustice or adversity , they often do not know how to express their emotions or where to seek help . These lonely , helpless , marginalized individuals are most vulnerable to anger-whether as its wielders or its victims .  
In line with the harsh predictions concerning " dejobbing " set forth in the book Jobshift : How to Prosper in a Workplace without Jobs , regular full-time , lifelong jobs with fixed objectives are quickly and quietly disappearing . After being laid off , many individuals are setting up their own private offices . Some do well ; most find themselves vulnerable . Left with no choice , they become security guards , sell insurance , do what they can to earn a couple extra bucks .  
Most of them are facing the challenges of globalization with economies made uniquely vulnerable by the crushing weight of foreign indebtedness , their precarious internal balance and a highly unfavourable international economic environment .  
Programmes for disadvantaged or vulnerable groups , in addition to reflecting a true understanding of the underlying problems of each group , must pass the test of being both equitable and efficient .  
That approach seeks to ensure that the basic needs of the poor , disadvantaged and vulnerable are addressed , that communities are empowered and that natural resources are managed and used in an optimal manner .  
Development planning and project evaluation should seek to droughtproof vulnerable areas , strengthen coping strategies , foster effective local , national and international institutions , and adopt sound macroeconomic policies ;  
The plans focused on vulnerable social groups and poor geographical areas , addressing minimum basic needs with the aim of improving the quality of life and expanding the base of the decisionmaking process .  
Much productive work of great social importance is not remunerated , such as caring for children and the elderly , protecting the environment and providing voluntary assistance to vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals and groups .  
The most vulnerable groups children , women , the elderly and the disabled were paying the highest price for shortsighted economic policies , political blunders , war and serious violations of human rights .  
The continent remained highly vulnerable to inequitable international economic policies , it was a frequent victim of natural disasters and it had an overwhelming debt burden at a time when financial flows were drying up and commodity prices remained low .  
A smaller number of resettlement places is required , predominantly for selected individuals whose physical security is threatened , or for vulnerable refugees for whom resettlement remains the only suitable , durable and humane solution .  
Small size also means that our entire society , not just areas of it , is equally vulnerable to dislocations of the global economic system , including currency and commodity price fluctuations , new international trading arrangements , and the changing fortunes of the major industrial economies .  
Emphasis has also been placed on the reform of the public sector and the provision of basic infrastructure in order to ensure the efficient delivery of reliable , high-quality services , the progressive restructuring of our educational system so as to put in place a sustainable human-resource development programme which would respond to the new challenges and needs of our development , and the employment of social policies aimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society .  
To achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development we need a supportive and favourable international economic environment as well as a fair , open and non-discriminatory trading system , one which recognizes that small and vulnerable economies like our own are at a particular disadvantage because of our size and the lack of economies of scale .  
The national reconstruction plan and the economic and social development plan are based primarily based on sustainable human development through medium - and long-term programmes targeting the population affected by the conflict and the most vulnerable sectors of society in order to improve the quality of life and social mobility by improving the systems of education , of health , of housing and of creating sustainable employment . 
He wished to draw attention to the suffering caused to the Libyan people by the unjust imposition of the sanctions , which had endangered many innocent lives , particularly those of the most vulnerable members of society , in blatant violation of human rights guaranteed under international human rights instruments .  
Nationally determined policies for integrated and multifaceted programmes , with special attention to women , to the poorest people living in critical areas and to other vulnerable groups should be implemented , ensuring the involvement of groups with a special potential to act as agents for change and sustainable development .  
In addition to meeting basic health needs , specific emphasis has to be given to protecting and educating vulnerable groups , particularly infants , youth , women , indigenous people and the very poor as a prerequisite for sustainable development .  
The general objectives of protecting vulnerable groups are to ensure that all such individuals should be allowed to develop to their full potential ( including healthy physical , mental and spiritual development ) ; to ensure that young people can develop , establish and maintain healthy lives ; to allow women to perform their key role in society ; and to support indigenous people through educational , economic and technical opportunities .  
Ensure that disadvantaged and vulnerable persons and groups are included in social development , and that society acknowledges and responds to the consequences of disability by securing the legal rights of the individual and by making the physical and social environment accessible ;  
People living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and participation in all aspects of political , economic and social life , and in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them and thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development .  
Access to credit by small rural or urban producers , landless farmers and other people with low or no income should be substantially improved , with special attention to the needs of women , and disadvantaged and vulnerable groups by :  
The legal system should be made more sensitive and responsive to the needs and special circumstances of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , to ensure the strong and independent administration of justice ;  
Such an inclusive society must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Supporting by legislation , incentives and other means , where appropriate , organizations of the vulnerable and disadvantaged groups so that they may promote the interests of the groups concerned and become involved in local and national , economic , social and political decision-making that guides society as a whole ;  
In this regard , it is concerned as to whether sufficient budgetary allocations are made and adequate social measures are being taken to protect children , in particular those living in poverty or belonging to vulnerable groups , from being the victims of this situation , in the light of the provisions of articles 3 and 4 of the Convention .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Ensure that structural adjustment programmes are so designed as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and communities , while ensuring their positive effects on such groups and communities by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities and devising measures to ensure that they gain access to and control over economic resources and economic and social activities ; actions should be taken to reduce inequality and economic disparity ;  
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed so as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to ensure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
To mitigate the heavy burdens of the poor , the Social Fund for Development ( SFD ) was established in 1991 as a temporary step to enhance structural adjustment programmes as well as to contribute to social well-being and protect vulnerable and low-income groups .  SFD executes six programmes , dealing with public works , community development , enterprise development , employment and retraining , institutional development and public transport .  
Open : in its conception , preparation and convening , the Summit involved all nations as well as a large number of public and private institutions and organizations , placing particular emphasis on the poor , weak and vulnerable , not only to address their problems but also to give them a voice in local , national and international forums . 
Although they said that the main focus of UNICEF should continue to be in rural areas , several delegations stressed the need for UNICEF to emphasize poor populations living in such environmentally vulnerable areas as slums and marginal urban pockets .  
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to assure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Depending on the nature of the hazard , the location of vulnerable people and assets , and designated responsibilities for action , elements of warning systems may be organized and implemented at local , national , regional or international levels .  
Along with the rest of the international community , her Government had been appalled by the callous treatment of vulnerable groups in that area and continued to be concerned about the fate of missing persons within the territory of the former Yugoslavia and the indications that mass executions might have taken place .  
The gradual economic reform which the transition to a market economy required was having adverse repercussions on the population 's standard of living and particularly on the most vulnerable sectors such as the disabled , elderly persons and young people .  
concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
The role of public administration must be reviewed if we are to face the increasing complexity of development challenges , such as the eradication of poverty , the growing interdependence of societies , the promotion of social justice and of a participatory democracy , the globalization of the economy , the protection of the environment and the need to increase internal stability in countries vulnerable to civil conflicts .  
In this context , the State seeks to modernize the kinds of measures taken by its public administration by gradually shifting its management and production actions towards a stronger public administration role in overseeing regulation and the proper functioning of economic mechanisms , in guaranteeing political and social stability and in protecting the most vulnerable sectors of society , in a spirit of social justice and rational solidarity .  
They also include improving public health , with emphasis on prevention and service for the most vulnerable groups especially children including planning , organizing and financing local health services ; improving basic public education , with emphasis on reducing illiteracy and on vocational training , with community participation , improved educational infrastructure , the promotion of culture and so on ; and the improvement of living conditions , physical planning and local infrastructure  
Like many other developing countries undergoing fundamental changes , Mongolia is faced with a host of problems : a low level of development , poverty , unemployment , an external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market . 
Our celebration last year of the fiftieth anniversary , the Nations golden jubilee , offered us a unique opportunity to review and contemplate the tremendous and substantial achievements of this body over the past five decades , during which this international Organization has made vigorous efforts to save the international community from the scourge of war and to alleviate the sufferings of vulnerable peoples throughout the world . 
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
Furthermore , my Government places particular emphasis on the needs of vulnerable groups , such as the disabled , in the process of social development , in the firm conviction that a genuinely sound and prosperous society can be realized only when all people , irrespective of their physical or mental disadvantages , are able to pursue a life of happiness and dignity based on stability and equality .  
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
A low level of development , poverty , unemployment , the external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations of the world market are some of the major ones .  
In addition , the problems of persistent poverty , increasing unemployment , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , environmental degradation , drug abuse and drug trafficking , crime , terrorism and social disintegration have combined to present a formidable array of challenges , which , if left unaddressed , threaten to overwhelm us and further marginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us . 
After 14 years of consideration of this item in this Committee , my delegation is gratified that the international community now has a better understanding of this remote and pristine continent and of the need for collective efforts to protect this fragile and vulnerable environment for the common benefit of humankind . 
During this time , Member States that have participated in the deliberations have spoken on a wide range of issues surrounding that continent , especially its role and influence on the atmosphere , oceans , biological conditions of the entire global system and the fragility of its environment , which is vulnerable to the impact of human activities .  
Stresses that Governments , in partnership with civil society and all other development actors , including non-governmental organizations and people living in poverty and their organizations should cooperate to meet the basic human needs of all - inter alia , income , resources , education , health care , nutrition , shelter , sanitation and safe water - in particular of people living in poverty and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups ;  
Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
India was encouraged that the international community had adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which underlined the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights , civil , political , economic , social and cultural , identified new forms of intolerance and violence and defined particularly vulnerable groups ( children and minorities ) who deserved special consideration .  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
Currently , the health of women in Rwanda was extremely vulnerable due to lack of medical infrastructure , supplies and personnel , limited financial resources , lack of access to health care , malnutrition , unsafe drinking-water , and the spread of HIV / AIDS . Women were more susceptible to diseases than men because they were overworked , had unplanned pregnancies , were malnourished during pregnancy and suffered complications from childbirth . 
[ Depending on local conditions in the housing sector and the availability of legal protection guaranteeing equal access to resources and opportunities , ] vulnerable groups include the poorest groups , some of the older persons , street children , youth , [ documented ] migrants , internally displaced persons , inhabitants of disadvantaged communities , people affected by natural and human-caused disasters , households headed by women , persons with disabilities and some indigenous people .  
( a bis ) Support , through legislation , incentives and other means , where appropriate , organizations of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups so that they may promote their interests and become involved in local and national economic , social and political decision-making ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
In other countries , such as has been independently reported in Malaysia , traditional healing as a means of treatment of dependence is sometimes based on beliefs that persons are vulnerable to supernatural influences , as well as physical causes , which increase the probability of dependence arising . 56 In such instances , traditional healers focus upon the well-being of the individual , and detoxification involves the use of herbal medicines , physical exercise and the promotion of physical health .  NULLThe role of acupuncture in the treatment of dependence has become more widespread in recent years .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
The number of individuals living in water-stressed countries or countries with a chronic water scarcity will increase tenfold in only one generation to encompass more than one third of the world population .  In waste areas , there has been an overexploitation of aquifers , which are becoming ever more seriously depleted .  The risks that threaten to erupt wherever socio-economic development depends on a continuously undermined key resource are evident : ultimate resource constraints will one day send shocks through such vulnerable societies .  
If followed through to a logical conclusion , a multisectoral , system-wide programming approach could facilitate work with the vulnerable rural youth audience by dealing with all aspects of the drug problem through a number of simultaneous activities including programmes in formal and non-formal education and competency-based training , demand reduction , construction of health facilities and addressing related health issues , law enforcement and crime prevention issues , alternative crop production and other drug-related issues in any given country .  NULLOrganizational approach to developing a multiple agency ,  
Society 's assigned roles and perceptions also play a part in the way men and women are involved in illicit trafficking ; are vulnerable to punitive actions from the law enforcement sectors ; are subject to human rights violations ; and are perceived in the community .  
The legal system should be made more sensitive and responsive to the needs and special circumstances of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in order to ensure a strong and independent administration of justice ;  
The main focus of the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable segments of the populations .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed as well as certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Over the past year , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , in close coordination with other United Nations bodies , has provided assistance to help countries to properly assess their full spectrum of risks , to prescribe , on the basis of global experience , the most cost-effective disaster reduction measures , to coordinate external guidance where needed on how to apply those measures in the most vulnerable areas , and to stimulate wider involvement and closer cooperation among the numerous international agencies with relevant technical and managerial expertise .  
The system is based on the criterion of rationalizing the use of State penal power by offering such options as : ( a ) punishing crime that has a high social cost and reducing the severity of punishment for less serious crimes ; ( b ) avoiding discrimination against the more vulnerable sectors , such as women and indigenous people ; ( c ) scrupulously respecting constitutional guarantees such as the principles of legality and guilt ; and ( d ) guaranteeing the rational and egalitarian implementation of the law .  
We agree to support ongoing and new creative partnerships , recognizing that indigenous people , youth and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups possess in common the potential for diverse realization of full human development .  
In the United Nations human rights programme of assistance , priority will be given to establishing criteria and implementing procedures for promoting economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , to exploring the root causes of human rights violations , to protecting the rights of persons who can be particularly vulnerable to abuse or neglect , including youth , persons with disabilities , the elderly and migrant workers .  
As part of the plan , which involved the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and several international non-governmental organizations , relief food and essential drugs were provided to vulnerable groups , seeds and tools were distributed to farming families , special feeding centres were set up and vaccination campaigns were conducted .  
At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
By a note verbale dated 30 August 1996 ( A / 51 / 330-S / 1996 / 721 and Corr . 1 ) , the representative of Bulgaria transmitted to the Secretary-General a national communication on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 50 / 58 E , in which it is pointed out , inter alia , that , by virtue of its geographic location and the outward nature of its economy , Bulgaria has been extremely vulnerable to the negative side effects of the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
The project will assist Governments and regional institutions in strengthening capability for monitoring and analysing climate and sea level trends ; identify areas vulnerable to the effects of climate change and sea level rise ; develop an integrated management and planning framework ; enhance regional and national capabilities through human resource development and institutional strengthening ; identify and assess policy operations and instruments ; and collect information for preparing national communications .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
The family unit in India was very strong and provided the social security net for vulnerable family members ; however , the traditional extended or joint family was increasingly being eroded because of the strains of modern life . 
The Commission continued to alert the international community to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; torture and enforced disappearance ; arbitrary detention ; violence against women , children and vulnerable groups ; the problem of internally displaced persons , extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , etc .  
It was mentioned that the Centre was also committed to protecting and maintaining the historic , cultural and natural heritage of indigenous and other people , and that Governments , as enabling partners , should create and strengthen effective partnerships with vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities .  
In its concluding observations on the report of Finland , the Committee expressed concern at the absence of an integrated monitoring mechanism capable , inter alia , of supervising the effectiveness of decentralized and sometimes privatized social ( health , education and social care ) municipal policies and services for the most vulnerable groups of society , including minority children .  
It is important that an effective mechanism be established , so that international actors and the authorities can discuss issues of common concern on a regular basis , share information on current activities and take joint decisions , especially on how best to meet the needs of vulnerable groups .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .

Xenophobia , intolerance and false doctrines of racial superiority gave rise to acts of discrimination and violence against vulnerable groups , migrant workers and foreigners ; it was therefore essential to give the highest support to the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination , a framework which would make it possible to address the political manipulation of intolerance through new efforts at the national and international levels .  
The Committee advised applicant States wishing to undertake energy-related exports to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for humanitarian purposes , that it was not in a position to approve the supply of energy-related products to the country for general distribution ; however , without prejudice to its final decision , the Committee expressed readiness to consider requests for authorization of shipments of strictly limited quantities of fuel targeting specific end-users among the most vulnerable groups of civilian population and for purely humanitarian purposes .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
He called on the secretariat to take into account , in all aspects of its work , the prevailing critical situation of those Latin American and Caribbean countries that had structurally weak and vulnerable economies , especially in the application of technical cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling governments to create an environment that was conducive to sustainable development and strengthening these countries ' capacity to participate fully in the international economy , trade and investment .

Yugoslavia has privatized some 90 per cent of the public housing stock and the issues now being addressed include maintenance of the existing housing stock , legalization of housing developments which are not in accordance with the approved plans , engaging local authorities in solving the housing problems of vulnerable groups , review of standards and norms and improving the database on housing .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
Barbados shares the anxiety of small developing States , which are highly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercely competitive environment given our sparse natural and human-resource base and limited administrative and technical capacity .  
With the successful conclusion of the military observer Mission in Guatemala , the definitive ceasefire between the Government and the URNG has established the necessary conditions for the promotion of peace and development in a subregion of the Americas which has been particularly vulnerable to pernicious blends of internal strife and external interference .  
Furthermore , the need calls for strengthening coordination between the aforementioned and other regional and international development programmes , and first and foremost the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , in order to mobilize economic resources and their generous influx of contributions required for a speedy response to the needs of affected and vulnerable peoples .  
These human rights are reinforced by the principles of participatory democracy , which assumes the involvement of PLHAs and their families , women , children and groups vulnerable to HIV / AIDS in designing and implementing programmes that will be most effective by being tailored to the specific needs of these groups .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
The basic principles of the negotiations are recognized as dialogue , mutual and continuing respect between the parties , voluntary resettlement of individuals , non _ discrimination , observance of the letter and spirit of the peace agreements , protection of the environment , maximum social benefit , preferential and special treatment of vulnerable groups , and community participation .  
The Committee is concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .

Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
The Committee remains concerned at prevailing traditional attitudes and harmful practices , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies , and at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes against vulnerable groups of children , such as the girl child , disabled children , children born out of wedlock and children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans .  
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
The representative of Uruguay supported by the observer for Costa Rica , stressed the importance of preventive measures and international cooperation in eradicating basic problems such as socio _ economic ones , which made children more vulnerable to such practices . 
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
In addition , these factors illustrate the need to exploit the potentially mutually supportive role of the public and private sectors and the importance of the current work under GATS on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .  12 .  Trade in the health service sector also demonstrates the extremely vulnerable position of poorer , especially least developed countries , which on the one hand suffer from a " brain drain " and on the other do not have access to advanced technologies .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
The large packagings shall be dropped onto a rigid , non-resilient , smooth , flat and horizontal surface , in such a manner as to ensure that the point of impact is that part of the base of the large packagings considered to be the most vulnerable . 
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Deeply concerned that understanding of human nature has been significantly modified by the rapid rise of developments in biotechnology as a science , particularly in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes , and that indigenous people are most vulnerable to the risk of being singled out for human genetic research and human gene patenting by the biotechnology industry ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
After extensive consultations , the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that , since no additional resources had been authorized under resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) , the needs of vulnerable groups would be met outside the framework of the resolution .  I am glad to report that the United Nations has been creative in preparing the plan for the three northern governorates and was able to increase the resources for some key sectors through reallocations within the total amount of funds available .  
In approving the new distribution plan , I have informed the Government that the United Nations accepts the Government 's assurances as a commitment that the necessary additional resources will be available for vulnerable groups in central and southern Iraq . I have also informed the Government that the United Nations will continue to observe the situation of such groups in the context of my responsibilities under resolutions 986 ( 1995 ) and 1111 ( 1997 ) to determine and report on the adequacy of resources to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population .  
The Special Rapporteur affirmed that , owing to their double marginalization as women and as migrants , women migrant workers might easily find themselves in situations in which they were vulnerable to violence and abuse , especially since women migrant workers dominated the informal labour market of most countries , working as domestic , industrial or agricultural labourers , or within the service industry . 
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty and the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society , and the creation of more and better jobs , requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
In resolution 1997 / 57 , section IX , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on the prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and other vulnerable groups , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
This structured programme of technical cooperation in the field of human rights involves the principal elements of the administration of justice and legal reform ; penitentiary administration ; training and institutional support ; and genocide response and vulnerable groups .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
Education was free at all levels and compulsory at the primary level , health care was provided free to all sectors of the population without exception , special attention being paid to vulnerable groups , and young people played an important part in the development and execution of development plans . 
Despite the collapse of rural infrastructure , the destruction of irrigation systems and the presence of mines in prime agricultural land , a number of projects are being implemented to support an increase in overall food production among settled farming communities , nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists , returnees and vulnerable groups .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1997 / 57 in which it requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect , all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
A second pre-requisite for effective warning is both the understanding by a vulnerable population of the hazards to which it may be exposed and an appreciation of the natural forces that can destroy elements of their economic livelihood and social well-being .  
These require organizational structures , information flows and decision-making protocols capable of acting effectively at both national and local levels to monitor and forecast hazards at those levels , and to generate risk scenarios that can indicate the potential impacts of an impending hazard event on specifically identified vulnerable groups and sectors .  
Insecurity in the northern and western regions of Rwanda , where numerous vulnerable populations are located , reduced the access of humanitarian workers to the areas , with accompanying reductions in the reach and scope of humanitarian programmes .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Noting that , despite the successful conclusion of the inter-Tajik talks and the efforts of the Government of Tajikistan to allocate limited resources to returning refugees and displaced persons , the economic situation in Tajikistan remains bleak and essential social services are largely dysfunctional , making a large percentage of the population extremely vulnerable ,  
Other replies contained favourable views : the appointment of a special rapporteur was seen , in the light of article 2 of the Covenant , as a way to overcome obstacles to the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to protect vulnerable groups such as migrants and minorities .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
We believe that serious consideration must be given to the immediate cancellation of the bilateral , multilateral and commercial debts of the least developed countries , without imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable .  
Targeting policies at the most vulnerable groups of society children , women , the elderly , the disadvantaged , the poor , the disabled is , moreover , a prerequisite for the successful realization of social justice , equity and respect for human dignity .  
The health component of such plans should address the key objectives spelled out in chapter 6 of Agenda 21 , namely ( a ) meeting primary health care needs , particularly in rural areas , ( b ) control of communicable diseases , ( c ) protecting vulnerable groups , ( d ) meeting the urban health challenge and ( e ) reducing health risks from environmental pollution and hazards .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country .  
There should also be special attention given to promoting social protection for vulnerable or marginalized groups of women workers , especially international female migrant workers , women in transition economies adversely affected by economic reforms and long-term unemployed older women workers .  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
The criteria for sustainable development should include better protection of all human rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as protection of the most vulnerable and impoverished .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Convinced that small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of global climate change and sea level rise , and that tropical storms , the El Ni �� phenomenon and drought have resulted in the inundation of some islands and have caused serious loss of resources in their exclusive economic zones , economic infrastructure , human settlements and culture ,  
In resolution 1997 / 33 , on the protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , States were urged , in collaboration and through the community , to promote a supportive and enabling environment for women , children and other vulnerable groups , by addressing underlying prejudices and inequalities through community dialogue , specially designed social and health services , and support community groups .  
The entire northern third of the country is hostile to Islamabad , and the more the northern forces continue their advance into Taliban-controlled territory , the greater will be the destabilizing consequences for Pakistan , already fragile and vulnerable from guns , drugs , corruption , ethnic killings and religious conflict . 
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development are essentially the same as those that are relevant at the national level : creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations , establishment of open , fair , equitable and transparent international regimes ; respect for and non-discriminatory application of the rules of the game so as to create equal opportunities and a level playing field for all ; and protection of the weakest and the most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
The Convention should be incorporated in the curricula of all educational institutions , and present initiatives to reach those vulnerable groups who are illiterate or without formal education should be pursued and further strengthened , with the cooperation of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and other organizations active in this field .  
With regard to the implementation of article 4 of the Convention , the Committee notes the lack of adequate legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure the full implementation of childrens economic , social and cultural rights to the maximum extent of the State partys available resources , in particular for the most vulnerable children , including girls , children with disabilities , abandoned children , children born out of wedlock , children from single-parent families , children victims of abuse and / or exploitation , and nomadic and refugee children .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
In the past few months , UNICEF emergency interventions had been focused on ensuring protection and care of the most vulnerable children , including tracing and reunification of unaccompanied children ; provision of primary health care services and of safe water , sanitation and hygiene education , particularly in the camps for refugees and displaced people ; monitoring children 's nutritional status and supporting therapeutic feeding ; and provision of emergency supplies .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
The Committee was concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery and the relevant ministries to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
While it is not for the Government itself to build or finance the housing units required to satisfy all of the demand in the country , it should make every effort to ensure that a fair share of the resources available is utilized for making low _ cost housing available to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of society , and enabling the private sector to contribute to that endeavour .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
The international community and States should take all the necessary measures to protect the rights of vulnerable segments of the population and give very serious consideration to holding a large _ scale discussion on the practice of embargoes and economic sanctions which are imposed on States and have adverse consequences for the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights of the segments concerned ;  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
The phenomenon of protracted and growing displacement , warfare that targets civilians and demolishes communities , and the disintegration of political , institutional and economic structures in crisis countries all point to the need for a better understanding of crises and their adverse impact on vulnerable communities .  
The memorandum of understanding has paved the way for increased levels of cooperation , including discussion of possible joint missions to assess and address the needs of separated minors and other groups identified as particularly vulnerable and the establishment of common standards and practices .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
It established a national commission , composed of representatives of the federal Government , communities and regions and with the collaboration of non-governmental organizations , to elaborate a comprehensive strategy with a view to strengthening social integration of the most vulnerable groups of society .  
The Government has also set in motion the Social Solidarity Network , a strategy that aims at improving the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of the population and initiating large social programmes through joint efforts of State-owned and territorial institutions , non-governmental organizations and the civil society .  
We recognize that poverty , unemployment and other obstacles to human development , such as civil strife and war , as well as crime and social injustices , render our States and societies vulnerable to transnational organized crime and corruption ; and we are , therefore , resolved to undertake and intensify all necessary steps and measures to address such problems , with the cooperation and support of the international community .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Civil peace and security are endangered by the combined impact of various forms of violence and conflict between ethnic , religious , linguistic and other groups , the rise of xenophobia and aggressive nationalism , of fanaticism and fundamentalism of different kinds , of terrorism and organized crime , exclusion and discrimination directed against vulnerable groups within societies , proceeding from a culture of violence and war .  
The variables were standardized and equal weights assigned to them in the computation of the composite vulnerability index , which confirmed that small island developing States were generally more vulnerable than larger countries . 
Womens social position , marital status , class , or membership in particularly vulnerable groups , such as refugee or migrant women , rural or urban poor women , are often linked to de facto , and sometimes also to de jure , discrimination .  
It was emphasized by one speaker that poverty , unemployment , social injustice and unfair and imbalanced trade and economic relations should be considered factors that rendered States vulnerable to organized transnational crimes .  
Developing countries , with their diverse agro-climatic situation , high and unstable mountains , perennial waterways coupled with peak seasonal discharge , as well as arid and semi-arid ecological conditions , are vulnerable to drought and desertification .  
It includes citizen initiative and participation , the sharing of responsibility between the central State authorities and autonomous State or private bodies , incentives to creativity and responses based very clearly on the specific needs of vulnerable groups .  
The Government 's social security policy is to meet the basic and special needs of the disadvantaged , including the financially vulnerable , the elderly and the severely disabled .  
The representative of Cuba said that orthodox liberalization and deregulation policies had been catastrophic for the East Asian economies , which were as vulnerable to external factors as they were attractive for international capital flows . 
Social development is impossible when basic essential social services are denied to the civilian population and where vulnerable members of the community are indiscriminately exposed to bombing , summary execution , rape and the threat of landmines .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
The Assembly had mandated UNCTAD to undertake analysis of current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups . 
There is thus a need for strengthened international cooperation with a view to enhancing the legal protection of vulnerable groups in internal conflict , to improve international monitoring and to promote an active role of the international community in protecting human rights and fundamental humanitarian standards in such situations .  
There is a common thread running through the preceding statements that makes unequivocally clear one of the characteristics of the recent armed conflicts that have led to political or military action by this Organization : the fact that their first and principal target has been the civilian population , in particular its most vulnerable sectors children , women , the elderly , the sick , refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
All population groups are covered by a coherent State health _ care system , with special attention being paid to women , pregnant women and parturients , children under 14 and other particularly vulnerable population groups , such as the elderly and the disabled . 
In light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to continue undertaking all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of its available resources , including through international cooperation , to continue ensuring that sufficient budgetary allocations are provided to social services for children and that particular attention is paid to the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
The absence of a consolidated text of the various provisions tends to inhibit focused and systematic attention to migrants as a specific vulnerable social group , and makes the tasks of the relevant advocacy bodies more difficult .  
Prompt and decisive action was needed to halt the decline in living standards in countries which had fallen prey to the global financial crisis , and Governments must enact policies to expand economic opportunities quickly for disadvantaged households and communities , and make them less vulnerable to future shocks .  
Therefore , international efforts to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries should be intensified through the implementation of an information strategy on aspects of globalization relating to social justice and the understanding among peoples that strengthened assistance to developing countries , vulnerable population groups and the victims of armed conflicts , human rights violations and natural disasters . 
Second , it was important to understand that , in addition to international instruments , the value systems of individual societies represented another basic means of protecting children in armed conflicts , since one of the main objectives of any society had always been the protection of children , who were its most vulnerable members .  
When the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's painful transition to independence in the 1960s saw the birth of the first armed militias , political leaders , including those in the United Nations , did not gauge what the refugee problem would become 40 years later , with refugee camps transformed into military training and arms-supply facilities , compromising any good-faith attempt to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable affected populations .  
The UNCTAD regular programme of technical cooperation will be coordinated to ensure an appropriate balance among developing regions with priority assigned to the specific needs of the least developed countries and other countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies . 
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
It has been widely recognized , nationally and internationally , that the existence of strong and transparent institutions is a prerequisite for an inclusive society based on the rule of law , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and democratic participation , which takes into account the special needs of vulnerable and disadvantages groups .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
To secure progressively , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
Women with mental disabilities are particularly vulnerable , while there is limited understanding , in general , of the broad range of risks to mental health to which women are disproportionately susceptible as a result of gender discrimination , violence , poverty , armed conflict , dislocation and other forms of social deprivation . 
Physical accessibility implies that adequate food must be accessible to everyone , including physically vulnerable individuals , such as infants and young children , elderly people , the physically disabled , the terminally ill and persons with persistent medical problems , including the mentally ill .  
Recent global conferences have highlighted human-centred economic growth ; basic physical infrastructures ; fundamental social services ; access to work ; land and credit ; empowerment of women ; food security ; natural resources regeneration ; good governance ; and vulnerable groups as the priorities in efforts to achieve the overarching objective to eradicate poverty .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
As a result , Hong Kong developed a light , specialized and efficient manufacturing base which , nonetheless , lacks technological depth and is therefore vulnerable to rising labour costs .  
For example , in Thailand , women working on family-owned land under contract to multinational companies earned cash income for the first time after years of unpaid labour in intensive rice cultivation . 15 However , the vertical integration of the agricultural sector which comes with the involvement of multinational corporations makes rural household food security vulnerable to market fluctuations . 
In the area of poverty alleviation , special emphasis was given to assisting Governments in enhancing the quality of life of the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including children , youth , older persons and disabled persons , through the provision of policy-oriented research and guidelines and the convening of intergovernmental meetings aimed at forging agreements on priority issues , policy approaches and regional benchmarks and their monitoring .  
An entire new cluster of WHO technical programmes has also been established to promote health in the context of sustainable human development , including a renewed emphasis on reducing malnutrition and improving management of environmental risks to human health , integrating health dimensions into poverty reduction programmes and protecting vulnerable populations in situations of crisis and post-crisis ; promoting the synergy between health and human rights constitutes an additional priority .  
Took note of the information provided by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on how to sign / ratify the Tampere Convention which provides a legal framework for the use of telecommunications in international humanitarian assistance ; ( i ) Noted that the considerable recent advances in seasonal weather and climate predictions , including of such phenomena as El Nio , enable improved preparedness of vulnerable communities against natural disasters .  
The Committee made an important point by emphasizing that in considering sanctions , it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing lite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law , and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .  
Contrary to what the aggressors are doing in the occupied territories , where civilians , including vulnerable persons , are massacred , raped , tortured , deported and robbed of their personal possessions and property , the Government of National Salvation , mindful of its international commitments , is protecting Rwandan , Ugandan and Burundian Tutsis in appropriate sites .  
The forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 which deal with international humanitarian law provides an opportunity for States which have signed and become party to the Conventions to reflect upon the degree of applicability of the provisions governing conduct of hostilities and respect for the civilian population , including vulnerable persons considered as non-combatants .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .  
The country 's narrow economic base , with tourism and fisheries contributing about 40 per cent of the gross domestic product , leaves the country excessively vulnerable to external shocks .  
As regards protecting families and vulnerable social sectors , we could mention the development , now under way , of a national family code , the strengthening and continuation of a programme of education in responsible parenting and the establishment of regulatory and legislative measures to protect the elderly , the disabled , and marginal populations .  
Concentrations of population in major urban centres ( megacities ) , many of which are located in hazard-prone areas in developing countries , are highly vulnerable to natural and technological hazards due to dependence on complex infrastructures and the occupation of marginal land .  
Expressing concern that the world is increasingly being threatened by large-scale natural disasters which will have long _ term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ,  
Similarly , the recommendation regarding the civil society and non-governmental organizations , encouraging their greater participation , especially of those groups that represent the vulnerable sections , such as the poor , the homeless and the unemployed , and the public interest ( e.g . consumer , environmental , human rights and women 's organizations ) , in the local and national decision-making , would be equally important .  
If providing food to poor families in all parts of the country is given equal value in a financially expensive programme of food security , the female children in backward villages may continue to be deprived , if social reforms are not pursued effectively . most vulnerable . 
Such a system should cover all children up to the age of 18 years , with specific emphasis on those who are particularly vulnerable , including children with disabilities , children living in poverty , children in the juvenile justice system , children of single _ parent families , children born out of wedlock , sexually abused children and institutionalized children .  
In light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to continue undertaking all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of available resources , including international cooperation , to continue ensuring that sufficient budgetary allocations are provided to social services for children and that particular attention is paid to the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
Of particular concern are certain vulnerable groups of children , including children with disabilities , particularly mental disabilities , girls , particularly Vidomegons , children living in remote rural areas , children living in extreme poverty , children living and / or working on the street , refugee and asylum _ seeking children , children in the juvenile justice system , children born out of wedlock , children of incestuous relations , and institutionalized children .  
Concern is expressed at the lack of a systematic , comprehensive and disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data _ collection mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention , especially the most sensitive , such as child abuse or ill _ treatment , but also in relation to all vulnerable groups of children , especially girls , children with disabilities , children living in rural areas , children living in poverty and refugee children .  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , [ and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ] [ and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ] ,  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
" The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
Ensuring access to basic social services for the unreached , the vulnerable and the most disadvantaged members of society is not only morally imperative but also economically rational , eradicating the worst manifestation of poverty and laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and productivity gains in the future .  
In addition to cash transfers for destitute families and children , the chronic sick , elderly and unemployed , assistance should be provided for developing capacities through the provision of basic services , skill training and retraining for the changing employment and market demand , micro-credit facilities , and other productive assets to help to broaden the income support base for the poor and vulnerable groups ;  
The recent economic crisis in some countries in the region has worsened further the situation for many , especially the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including women , children , older persons , disabled persons , minority groups and migrant workers .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
Combined efforts of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , should help countries to enhance the performance of macroeconomic management , achieve greater coherence in the policies affecting economic , financial , social and environmental aspects , and protect the most vulnerable groups , and thus give the concerned country an opportunity to use this support to further its national goals while integrating better into the global economy .  
Measures which should be taken to ensure the right to health are understood to be effective administration of available resources to improve health , establishment of health policies with an emphasis on prevention , increased primary health care , special attention to the health needs of the most vulnerable and free health care for the most economically disadvantaged .  
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
Efforts must be made to harmonize economic and social development , achieve a more equitable distribution of income , promote gender equity and implement proactive social policies , with special emphasis on the needs of the most vulnerable groups , such as children , women , the disabled , the elderly , indigenous persons and the unemployed .  
The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
C Analysing the impact , both positive and negative , of substantial reduction or elimination of export subsidies on developing countries , with particular attention being paid to the special concerns of LDCs , net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) and other small and vulnerable economies .  
Recognizing the continuing efforts of debtor countries , despite the great social cost involved , to pursue economic reform , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes aimed at achieving stability , raising domestic savings and investments , reducing inflation , improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development , including the eradication of poverty as well as the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations ,  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
This could be achieved if the international community would : recognize the special situation and needs of African countries , particularly supply constraints ; apply differential treatment in favour of developing countries , including small and vulnerable economies , in a concrete and comprehensive fashion ; and remove all barriers facing the trade of African countries , in particular of the least developed countries .  
Governments , vulnerable to the threats of withdrawal from transnational companies and to political pressure from voters who were not prepared to change their lifestyles , had difficulty in maintaining social standards and affording the initial cost of moving to environmentally friendly technologies and behaviours .  
However reasonable the original managerial decision to make a loan or acquire an asset , and however justified its initial classification as low-risk by banking supervisors , the loan is vulnerable to a possible eventual deterioration in its status . 17 So long as cycles of financial boom and bust are features of the economic system , so also will be unforeseeable deteriorations in the status of many bank assets . 
The objectives were to achieve nutritional coverage of the most vulnerable sector , reduce maternal and infant mortality , and ensure the supply of clean drinking water ; eliminate female illiteracy in rural areas and provide vocational training in urban areas , and educate women about their rights ; and reduce poverty , provide small loans to womens rural cooperatives , and increase employment .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
Along with domestic efforts , the international environment must also be improved , as it could have a direct impact on developing countries , which were fragile and especially vulnerable to external blows .  
A number of challenges lay ahead , including the achievement of a serious reduction in excess mortality and morbidity among the poor , which would require Governments to reallocate resources to activities that had proved to be effective and to focus on major diseases , such as malaria , HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis , and on the most vulnerable populations , particularly women .  
Among the many pressing needs are the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of child combatants ; the protection and safe return of internally displaced and refugee children ; the provision of humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations composed largely of women and children ; and the registration , protection and reunification of unaccompanied or orphaned children and children in foster families .  
Those developments had taken place despite the coercive economic sanctions imposed on the Libyan people in the early 1990s , which had caused it enormous losses and had impeded plans and programmes designed to meet the needs of vulnerable groups in society .  
The United Nations must provide some direction in the debate on the complex issues surrounding royalties for genetic material , and should help to fashion an international technological architecture that encouraged technological advances , but not at the cost of marginalizing the poorest and most vulnerable .  
Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in Iraq , which particularly affects certain vulnerable groups , such as children , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
The growing openness of some economies made them more vulnerable to adverse external effects and promoted the spread of local economic troubles to other regions of the world , as the recent financial crisis in Asia had demonstrated .  
Globalization was the newest form of economic colonialism ; it made possible the efficient exploitation of vulnerable nations in the name of free markets and allowed transnational capitalists to rampage through the developing world , sometimes with the connivance , and even the active participation , of the rich elite of those poor countries . 
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Issues addressed with regard to the linkages between poverty and various vulnerable groups , including indigenous peoples , minorities , migrant workers and persons affected by AIDS , included social exclusion and marginalization , the exploitation of natural resources , transnational corporations and the impact of their activities on the enjoyment of the rights of communities concerned by such activities , as well as the overall policies of host Governments . 
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
They should promote greater institutional convergence between developed and developing countries and assist the latter to establish the physical infrastructure necessary for their economic and social development , including by supporting social safety nets to protect the socially vulnerable and those marginalized by globalization and providing access to basic education , health and good drinking water .  
Urges also the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , provision of basic social services , poverty eradication , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of youth , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation , respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;

Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts , in order to promote international financial stability , and to this end to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
The need for greater support for the developing countries had to be seen in the context of four important realities : firstly , unless effective measures were taken at national and global levels to regulate , supervise and control financial activities and international capital flows , financial instability would continue to recur with increasing frequency and ferocity , destroying the most fragile economies and vulnerable populations and crippling their efforts to eradicate poverty .  
Recognizing the continuing efforts of debtor countries , despite the great social cost involved , to pursue economic reform , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes aimed at achieving stability , raising domestic savings and investments , reducing inflation , improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development , including the eradication of poverty as well as the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations ,  
Under the authority of the national committee on the use of illicit drugs , the relevant national institutions had focused their activities on human resource development , scientific research , periodic evaluation and the provision of services to the most vulnerable sectors of society , including young people .  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts to promote international financial stability and , to this end , to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crises in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;  
Humanitarian agencies fear increased suffering of the most vulnerable , particularly refugees , internationally displaced persons , the disabled , children , the chronically ill , urban elderly and social cases .  
This consists of consolidating the activities of associations working with the elderly , strengthening work in the specialized medical and paramedical areas , validating the role of older people by benefiting from their experience and knowledge and providing permanent assistance to 3 , 100 vulnerable older people in the context of the national programme for the protection of older people .  
Similarly , in the Veracruz declaration , signed on 19 March 1999 in Mexico , the Rio Group reaffirmed its ongoing commitment to implementing economic and social programmes designed to generate favourable conditions for the definitive integration of the vulnerable sectors of the population into the development process and to eliminate structural imbalances , in particular , conditions of poverty and marginalization .  
Since then , Egypt has embarked upon reforming its economy and has implemented structural adjustment programmes to achieve economic growth aimed at improving the living standards of the Egyptian people while establishing social safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable groups of our society .  
New or restored democracies need : fair treatment with respect to the debts they inherited from anti-democratic governments ; preferential access to major world markets ; concessionary credit policies by international financial institutions ; cooperation in the economic , technological and educational spheres ; and the advantages to be gained from aid and assistance programmes by international organizations for our countries most vulnerable populations .  
It has weighty legal , political and strategic implications , since it affects one of the vital organs of the United Nations , entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security and thereby vulnerable to the subtle interplay of the interests of the Powers , sometimes to the detriment of the very cause of maintaining international peace and security that it is supposed to promote .  
As a subregion that is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters resulting from violent tropical cyclones , El Nio , tsunamis , tidal waves , droughts , brush fires and earthquakes , we are committed to supporting the remarkable role played by the United Nations and its response system , including its engagement with many intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , in the delivery of much-needed relief assistance to our peoples .  
Despite the economic growth that began under the influence of the structural adjustment programmes combined with the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 , the problems of survival experienced by poor and vulnerable households were aggravated and the harmful effects of the crisis have been very much felt in some social sectors education , employment and health and have to an extent compromised the major gains made in previous decades .  
Although the number of people in Malta living below the acceptable national standard of living is about 1 per cent of the population , the Government continues to give special importance to social services and , within the constraints of a small island economy , social welfare programmes now provide an adequate safety net even for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged .  
The problem of HIV AIDS is of prime importance in the policy of the Government of Honduras , and the focus of reproductive rights and of attention to priority vulnerable population groups is therefore principally on promoting low-risk behaviour , through a sustained and systematic information and education campaign , and through increased medical , counselling , hospital and laboratory services for sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ,  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
I have a clear duty also to insist that the intellectual debate on how to strengthen the sustainable development prospects for a uniquely fragile and vulnerable group of countries is informed by the most current thinking , produced by those who fully understand the complex circumstances of the countries for which they prescribe solutions .  
Yet at the same time we stated candidly that the islands were increasingly vulnerable and that their precarious situation , if left unattended , would soon mirror similar critical circumstances in Africa , the least developed countries and the landlocked developing countries .  
Among these efforts we would like to mention the national economic conference , held in Bata in 1997 , which had as its objectives the involvement of all segments of society in defining the priorities for national development in all sectors , the designing of strategies for such development in the short , medium and long term and the rational use of oil resources to meet the needs of the most vulnerable sectors and to promote productivity for the sake of the harmonious development for our country .  
The need for universal commitment to such preventive measures has become more pressing due to the isolation and oceanic location of some small island developing States and their total dependence on a marine and limited terrestrial base , which render them highly vulnerable to contamination from such waste .  
The Committee notes that since 1994 , in addressing the budget deficits by slashing social expenditure , the State party has not paid sufficient attention to the adverse consequences for the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the Canadian population as a whole , and by vulnerable groups in particular .  
The Committee is concerned that the State party did not take into account the Committees 1993 major concerns and recommendations when it adopted policies at federal , provincial and territorial levels which exacerbated poverty and homelessness among vulnerable groups during a time of strong economic growth and increasing affluence .  
The Guidelines follow three broad and interconnected approaches , namely ( a ) improvement of governmental capacity for acknowledging the Governments responsibility for multisectoral coordination ; ( b ) widespread reform of laws and legal support services with a focus on the status of women , children and vulnerable groups ; and ( c ) support for increased private sector and community participation in the response to HIV AIDS .  
Guideline 5 encourages States to enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws to protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors ; ensure privacy and confidentiality ; ensure ethics in research involving human subjects ; and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies when the laws are breached .  
To be sure , projects addressing longer-term development needs should be pursued , but in parallel with the continued provision of basic humanitarian relief to those in need and especially to the most vulnerable groups among them , such as the elderly , the disabled and women heads of household , who are likely to continue to need humanitarian assistance regardless of the pace of development .  
Further standards are likely to be elaborated and mechanisms established at the international level , especially to ensure that genetic research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human rights and dignity , particularly of vulnerable groups of people . 
The CMAs Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics , which were developed in 1993 , are unique in that they represent the only available internationally recognized code of medical ethics to ( a ) deal with conditions of practice in developing countries ; ( b ) set out the ethical obligations of health professionals to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community ; and ( c ) be annotated throughout with references to corresponding internationally recognized human rights instruments .  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
Completion and implementation as called for under article 6 of the Convention on Biodiversity , of comprehensive national biodiversity strategy and action plans that , by individual country , ( i ) assess the state of knowledge on biodiversity ; ( ii ) identify vulnerable and endangered ecosystems and species ; ( iii ) identify activities and processes that endanger biodiversity ; and ( iv ) contain strategies for the protection and sustainable use of island biodiversity .  
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , administrative or technical opportunities for criminal organizations to commit profitable crimes and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
To secure , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer disproportionately from reproductive ill health .  
The Commission also recognized that its discussions and the analysis of the trade issues by the secretariat as well as the technical cooperation activities undertaken had made a positive contribution to the effective integration of developing countries , particularly LDCs and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , as well as the economies in transition , into the international trading system .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Concerned also that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Urges also the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , provision of basic social services , poverty eradication , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of youth , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation , respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
The continued imposition by international financial institutions upon some developing countries of policies for structural adjustment can have profoundly negative impacts on the poor and vulnerable .  
That neoracism was directed against vulnerable social groups such as migrant workers , refugees , ethnic or religious minorities and indigenous populations , who were reproached for being different ; that difference , instead of being celebrated as a source of richness and complementarity , became a synonym for rejection and discrimination .  
The Government , which has a minimal credit limit and is determined to abide by established budgetary norms , is making enormous financial sacrifices so as not to pass on the rising costs of petroleum products to the vulnerable segments of the population .  
Human rights education an effective tool to prevent human rights violations should be understood to cover the whole range of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the right to development , as well as those of vulnerable groups .  
In order to bring about satisfactory political , social and cultural integration , it was necessary to meet the needs of vulnerable groups in difficult circumstances such as women , children , the poor , displaced persons and refugees .  
Women and children become vulnerable to trafficking because of social inequality and the vast economic disparity within States and between rich and poor States , even though considerable efforts have gone into standardsetting to combat this evil .  
In conclusion , the representative emphasized Indias determined , concrete and sustained efforts to eliminate poverty and social disability and empower the poor and vulnerable .  
They stressed the special importance of cooperation in alternative development , including the better integration of the most vulnerable sectors involved in the illicit drug market into legal and viable economic activities .  
Other central regions and western and southeastern regions were also affected , but the economic and social consequences in those regions are less severe than in the more vulnerable northeastern and eastcentral regions .  
Considering ways in which early warning systems for extreme weather events might be strengthened or established in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to help address the climatechange related requirements of particularly vulnerable countries ;  
The extreme poverty faced by 80 per cent of the population , recent poor harvests , severe drought , and the collapse of the social safety net , public health , sanitation and educational systems render the achievements of the peace process extremely vulnerable .  
Strengthening existing [ and , where needed , establishing ] early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .  
An open , rulebased , equitable , secure , nondiscriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system that accorded preferential treatment to the weak and vulnerable would be vital to that end .  
In short , although globalization offers enormous potential for human development in the twentyfirst century , its current benefits are unevenly distributed while its costs are concentrated among the poorest and most vulnerable .  
It is equally intolerable that the intense fighting is hindering the access of humanitarian agencies to many regions , particularly the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo , depriving vulnerable populations of the precious assistance they so sorely need .  
While this debt may be manageable under rapid growth circumstances and in an otherwise favourable economic environment , their situation leaves them very vulnerable to abrupt changes in internal or external factors .  
We also recommend that positive consideration be given to the Secretary-Generals practical and action-oriented recommendations , in particular those that are targeted at enhancing the capacity of national Governments and the international community to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law ; improving engagement by the Security Council and others with a view to obtaining access to vulnerable populations for humanitarian operations ; and developing clear criteria and procedures for the identification and separation of armed elements in situations of massive population displacement .  
While welcoming the fact that access to vulnerable populations is improving , we note that faltering security remains a constant threat to crucial humanitarian and rehabilitation efforts , as illustrated by the deplorable attack on six workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) in April .  
My delegation has also subscribed to the premise that for sanctions to be effective , they must be implemented within a prescribed time frame and be subject to close monitoring and periodic review in order to ensure their continued usefulness and validity , as well as to evaluate their impact on vulnerable populations and neighbouring States .  
The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .  
In the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups for instance indigenous people , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with HIV / AIDS .  
In addition to the five major themes on its agenda , the World Conference should also take up other important issues , especially ways to reduce ethnic tensions and to prevent ethnic and racial conflicts ; the economic impact of racism ; discrimination against migrant workers ; the question of asylum-seekers , refugees and disabled persons ; trafficking in human beings ; assaults on minorities and vulnerable groups ; the rights of indigenous peoples ; and the role of the Internet and of communications technologies .  
In light of article 4 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that , the State party undertake a study on the impact of the Governments budgetary resources allocated for children and their families in order to assess their effectiveness and to develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure the full implementation of the economic , social and cultural rights of children to the maximum extent of available resources , in particular at the local level and with respect to children belonging to the most vulnerable groups in society .  
The Committee recommends that the State party allocate appropriate resources and develop comprehensive policies and programmes to improve health infrastructure , to increase the number of trained health and welfare , including mental health , professionals , to improve the health situation of children , to facilitate greater access to primary health services , to reduce the incidence of maternal , child and infant mortality , to prevent and combat malnutrition , especially in vulnerable and disadvantaged groups of children , and to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation that all measures to implement economic , social and cultural rights should be undertaken to the maximum extent of . . . available resources in the light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention and that particular attention be paid to effective budget mobilization and allocation , in particular for the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
Particular attention should be paid by the discussions under both sub-themes to the position and special vulnerability of children who have been marginalized or discriminated against on the basis of their ethnic origin of economic status who can be , for example , singled out in schools for bullying or degrading treatment by teachers or be more vulnerable to violence within the family that escapes detection by the normal monitoring systems ( for example for families that are homeless or illegal migrants ) .  
Six different approaches to caring for orphaned and vulnerable children were described : ( a ) informal , non-statutory foster care ; ( b ) community-based support structures ; ( c ) home-based care and support ; ( d ) unregistered residential care ; ( e ) statutory adoption and foster care ; and ( f ) statutory residential care .  
The Centre had also initiated preparatory work on a new programme activity in crime prevention to promote a culture of lawfulness and to assist national and local governments in protecting vulnerable groups at risk of being recruited by organized crime , in particular through educational and civic programmes .  
Also affirm in particular that the victims right to have access to justice is of special importance to victims of racial discrimination in the light of their vulnerable situation , socially , culturally and economically , and that the principle of equality of victims in legal systems is meaningless unless it is accompanied by affirmative action ;  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;  
Trade is the most important mechanism for most if not all small island developing States to expand domestic savings and finance their various development processes especially because they seriously lack comparative advantages and economies of scale , being vulnerable and dependent on a small number of export commodities , predominantly agriculture , light manufacturing and underdeveloped service-based sectors , to drive much-needed foreign exchange earnings , employment and development . 
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Request the operational programmes and agencies of the United Nations , financial and development institutions , in accordance with their mandates , to assign higher priority and provide more funding to projects in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination , and to include such vulnerable groups at the stage of the development and implementation of projects concerning them ;  
Urge States to consider taking special measures to protect especially vulnerable persons and groups which may be subject to multiple forms of discrimination on account of their gender , age , national origin , sexual orientation , social or economic status , physical or mental disability , state of health , religious belief or any other condition liable to give rise to discrimination , including racial discrimination ;  
Also invite them to ensure their full enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in particular women , children and vulnerable groups , so that persons who admit to an HIV infection , those presumably infected and other persons affected are protected against violence , stigmatization , discrimination , unemployment and other negative consequences which may be compounded by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
They therefore include commitments on amending the legal framework , strengthening and decentralizing the Ministry of Labour and Social Security , providing occupational training and education , improving social security and expanding its coverage , protecting the most vulnerable categories of workers and promoting collective bargaining and consensus methods of settling labour disputes .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Recognizing that care , support and treatment can contribute to effective prevention through increased acceptance of voluntary and confidential counselling and testing , and by keeping people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups in close contact with health-care systems and facilitating their access to information , counselling and preventive supplies ;  
Affirming that beyond the key role played by communities , strong partnerships among Governments , the United Nations system , intergovernmental organizations , people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups , medical , scientific and educational institutions , non-governmental organizations , the business sector including generic and research-based pharmaceutical companies , trade unions , media , parliamentarians , foundations , community organizations , faith-based organizations and traditional leaders are important ;

Calls upon Calls uponStrongly recommends to participating States to introduce , or encourage the introduction of , or reinforce , human rights education , including promoting anti-racism , with a view to combating prejudices which lead to racial discrimination and to promoting understanding , tolerance and friendship between different racial or ethnic groups in school curricula and in institutions of higher education and to support public formal and non-formal education programmes designed to promote cultural diversity and self-esteem of vulnerable groups ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
This should include mechanisms for protection when third parties evict a vulnerable group from their bases of subsistence and mechanisms of punishment and compensation in evictions already effected ; the guarantee of security of land tenure and other productive resources ; effective regulation of workers rights ; the guarantee of non-discrimination against women , in the area of work as well as in relation to ownership of property and productive resources ; and the guarantee of traditional rights of indigenous communities in relation to their natural resources ; ( c ) Obligation to fulfil .  
The consumption of food in sufficient quantity and adequate quality to ensure adequate growth of babies and children , as well as women , elderly and other vulnerable groups , must be monitored at the local level ( communities , municipalities , districts and so on ) by the health and social welfare authorities ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Reaffirms the need for strengthening an international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and within its framework of action ;  
Convinced that human rights education and information is in the best interests of particularly vulnerable segments of society , such as children , youth , women , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with HIV / AIDs and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing that low-lying and other small island countries , countries with low-lying coastal , arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods , drought and desertification , and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change ,  
To protect the poor in the short run and sustain progress already achieved towards the international development goals , Fund-supported programmes continue to include social safety nets to cushion the negative impact of economic reforms and external shocks on vulnerable groups .  
In a multi-faction conflict , such as that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , experience has shown that , in order to gain meaningful and regular access to vulnerable populations within different combat zones , where front lines are shifting from day to day , the consent of many parties has to be obtained at the local , regional , national and international levels .  They may include a range of armed groups and other non-State actors with often diverse or obscure political , economic and strategic goals .  
I encourage the Security Council to conduct more frequent fact-finding missions to conflict areas with a view to identifying the specific requirements for humanitarian assistance , in particular obtaining safe and meaningful access to vulnerable populations .  In view of the prevalence of civil wars among todays conflicts , a structured dialogue with armed groups is indispensable for reaching and protecting vulnerable populations in times of war ( see paras . 30-32 and 48-50 ) .  
Such projects have included peoples sensitization campaigns on indigenous people issues in Chile ; training sessions for school teachers and representatives of social groups in Chile ; the establishment of a centre in Mexico where human rights violations can be reported and which provides legal assistance to vulnerable groups , such as rural populations , street children , prisoners and people living with HIV / AIDS . France Liberts has also been advocating against the death penalty ; a CD-ROM against racism was also produced and distributed among schools and for public awareness purposes . 
The least developed countries committed to pursuing balance policies that sought to limit transmission of external shock into the domestic economy while promoting gradual liberalization , and developing safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of the population against the consequences of external shocks .  
Among the most significant aspects , the Government emphasized the importance given to the effective implementation of international accords on the matter , the fact that a lack of internal legislation should not hinder the protection of internationally recognized human rights , the provision of non-discrimination and equality of all persons , and the adoption of sanctions against the abuse and ill-treatment of certain vulnerable groups .  
Despite repeated calls for a change in the current international economic , trade and financial system , which did not meet the needs of the developing countries , especially those of the most vulnerable , no specific conclusions had yet been reached .  
This is a solid basis for continuing work in this area , which is steadily increasing in importance in a more interdependent and vulnerable world in which our democratic values are still constantly being challenged by undemocratic and violent acts .  
Call upon all States , consistent with applicable international standards , to take or continue to take measures to strengthen asylum and render protection more effective including through the adoption and implementation of national refugee legislation and procedures for the determination of refugee status and for the treatment of asylum-seekers and refugees , giving special attention to vulnerable groups and individuals with special needs , including women , children and the elderly ;  
The international community must develop and improve efforts to integrate the most vulnerable social sectors involved in the illicit drug trade through legal and viable economic activities .  
Recognizing that the interrelationship of ageing and disability among women needs special attention , since lifelong neglect of womens health , social condition , poor nutrition and hard physical labour leaves them at and after menopause especially vulnerable to the risks of disabilities ,  
In January 2000 , the Security Council had recognized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic to which women and girls were especially vulnerable was a major threat to development and security , while the Commission on the Status of Women had emphasized that the full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights was of crucial importance in preventing the further spread of the disease .

Recognize that sexual violence during armed conflict constituting serious violations of international humanitarian law has been used as a tool of systematic forms of discrimination , abuse and genocide directed against racial or ethnic populations of non-combatants , and that race and gender combine to make women particularly vulnerable to certain types of violence , particularly sexual violence ;  
Strengthening existing and , where needed , establishing early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;
