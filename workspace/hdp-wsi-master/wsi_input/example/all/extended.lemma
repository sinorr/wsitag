The " five noes policy " is not some new olive branch extended by the new Taiwanese leaders , it is not their political bargaining chip , because as a minority leader , and with the DPP not the majority organization in the island 's public opinion , the points rejected in the " five noes " have strong support among those opposing " independence " in the opposition parties , which exercises a natural restraining action on the DPP . It is not something that any leader or the DPP can easily promote at will .

Some law experts note that because LC fraud involves many middle links , and units and personnel at home and overseas that take part in the fraud are entitled to service charges illegally .  They say that fraud carried out in collusion by lawless elements at home and abroad , while preventing banks from collecting the loans they have extended and increasing their bad debts by geometric progression , is often accompanied by corruption , bribery , and other forms of lawlessness .  Thus its danger to society is even more penetrating and extensive than ordinary crimes .

Two or three hundred years ago Hakka began coming to Taiwan and settled in relatively interior , mountainous areas in what is now the Pingtung-Kaohsiung region in southern Taiwan and the Taoyuan-Miaoli region in central Taiwan . Here they extended their experience in pioneering harsh and demanding terrain , and their characteristic traits were passed down from generation to generation .  
The institution Mr . Chen worked for was a unit dealing with foreign affairs . During the six years of his employment there , he had many opportunities to be stationed abroad , but not once did he take so much as a single step outside the country . Always remembering that he was the only male in the third generation of his extended family , every week he returned to the family ' s home several times to help his paraplegic grandfather bathe . Such traditional filial responsibilities were his to shoulder .  
But in hunting and fishing society with its low productivity , faced with the harsh realities of nature and a lack of material resources , people gradually extended the range of resources they could use . For instance , the Oroqen people of northeast China once had a taboo against eating bears and tigers , but gradually came to eat bear meat and use bear skins for clothing . But a people which faces the constant threat of death and hunger both needs animals and fears them , and this has given rise to many hunters ' taboos .  
But these days , other products which have the same symbolic meaning - - like turtle-shaped patterns constructed out of canned food or made from mushrooms or day lilies - - are widely popular ; some people even just use cash as a substitute .

During the years of the preposterous and unprecedented Cultural Revolution , I finally realized that the difference between Mao Zedong and Karl Marx was that Mao extended the scope of the powerful machinery of the dictatorship of the proletariat from the political and economic sphere into the domain of the human mind .  
Five years ago , because he had to look after his children , he could not go too far from home , so he decided to embark on extended observation of a small , nameless earthen mountain next to the Wanfang residential development . He christened it " Little Green Mountain , " and produced a series of notes and articles describing the natural scenery and plant and animal life through the four seasons on the southern rim of the Taipei basin .  
On the contrary : birdwatchers have discovered that ever since accumulating soil from construction work upstream and an ever-decreasing flow of water caused sandbars to appear in the stretch of river near Huachiang Bridge , more and more ducks and geese have gathered there , and they have gradually extended their domain upriver to the Kuangfu , Huachung , Chungcheng and Yungfu bridges , so that the goose and duck park has had to be enlarged and its name changed .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
This second limitation means that some 2.6 million " workers with no fixed employer " and self-employed people will be excluded from the unemployment insurance system .

The year before last the show " Splendors of Imperial China " was well received by the American academic and cultural communities , and afterwards many nations extended invitations to the National Palace Museum . The French government worked especially hard to meet the Musuem 's needs , even passing a new law designating measures to protect foreign art works on exhibition there . Now , 63 years after part of the National Palace Museum collection first went to Europe for a show in London in 1935 , works from the museum are going to Paris .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
Dusk is falling , and having completed a hard day 's work , everyone is relaxing in front of the television in their warm homes , when scenes of hurricane-devastated neighbourhoods appear on the screen . " These are our friends , " intones the familiar voice of Jason Hu , Minister of Foreign Affairs . In what turns out to be the voice-over of an advertisement , he appeals for a helping hand to be extended to long-term friends of the ROC ravaged by Hurricane Mitch .  
Before the war , he only hunted animals , or perhaps would take part in an occasional " headhunting ceremony . " In either case , he acted on his own behalf , or at most on behalf of his tribe in times of armed conflict with neighboring tribes . After the war broke out , though , he was acting on behalf of the entire nation . The sacrifices he made were for a society that extended far beyond the confines of his tribe , and his actions took on a totally different significance .  
Another new style is " taiji-daoyin , " a 12-movement routine refined from traditional taijiquan by the well-known practitioner Hsiung Wei . Taiji-daoyin , which is easy to begin learning and requires a minimal amount of space for practice , has already been adopted as a keep-fit exercise by major corporations such as Acer , as well as being extended into modern dance and applied as a surprising new form of " Chinese-style dance workout . "  
Competitors were judged according to very rigorous standards . The head had to be kept centered , shoulders low , elbows down , arms loose , fingers extended , the breath drawn from the abdomen rather than the chest , etc . To aid in judging the skills of the competitors , the rules put special emphasis on large , sweeping moves . In addition to leg lift , fist form , step form , palm form , fluidity , and coordination , the competitors were also judged on style and rhythm .  
If a big clan lived in a traditional compound centered around their own courtyard , anyone that was sick or out of work could recuperate under the protective wings of the extended family , " says Taipei County deputy chief Lin Wan-yi , who is currently planning the county 's social welfare system . Within a single generation , the functions of the family declined greatly .  
With wisdom and intelligence , the people of the Han institutionalized the country 's political , economic and social systems , laying down the framework for the subsequent development of Chinese society . By the time the second millennium arrived , it was the era of the ultra-refined Song dynasty . This was a period when individual freedoms were extended , encouraging one of the most remarkable flowerings of literature , fine art and handicrafts in history .  
Many scholar-officials also formed communities out of their own extended families by establishing clan congregations , updating genealogies , and setting up private schools to educate promising youngsters . These new forms of local organization helped society to remain orderly and civilized , and fostered an overall mood of culture and enlightenment . Rule by the learned  
The latter was the northernmost of these three counties , and extended all the way to Taipei and Keelung , but settlers long declined to venture north of Touliu ( today the county seat of Yunlin ) . Further south in Tainan , the Dutch arrived in the 1620s and established a fortress called Zeelandia . Later in that century , the Ming loyalist Koxinga 's able minister Chen Yonghua adopted a policy of keeping Taiwan equally strong in both the cultural and military spheres . A period of cultural flowering ensued in the south .  
Twenty years ago theorists proposed that the magnetic field extended down below the sun 's surface to a depth of 0.7 solar radii from the center of the sun surface , but signals from the magnetic field are very weak , and could not be detected by the methods and instruments then available . But today acoustic imaging has enabled Chou Dean-yi to find much stronger evidence in support of the 20-year-old theory , and this is highly significant for solar astronomy .  
Italy 's " Slow Down the City " campaign was initiated by the mayor of a small Italian town . The campaign has also extended to the preservation of traditional vineyards threatened by multinational firms and industrialized farms , and restaurants have refused to accept " fast-food culture , " insisting on maintaining their original regional cuisines . Seventy Italian cities have already joined the campaign .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
The male 's dorsal and pelvic fins have long threadlike rays , and the tips of its red tail fins are extended in a swallowtail shape . The varied effects of their fins rippling in the water are very pleasing to the eye .  
The applications for refined CHM can be extended considerably . Already a number of manufacturers in Taiwan are adding raw materials from Kingstone to all kinds of products , including yogurt and ice cream . These raw materials can also be put to use in natural colorings and flavorings , edible fibers , cosmetic masks , bandages , and more . These uses are already common overseas , with the production value of such products increasing year in and year out , but in Taiwan there is still vast room for R &amp; D and promotion .  
For Wang Steak , which has annual revenues in Taiwan in excess of NT $ 1 billion and long ago extended its operations to the US , entry into the PRC was obviously rather late . Park Cheng explains : " We did a survey of white-collar workers several years ago and discovered that although Shanghai once did have areas controlled by Britain and France , nobody in Shanghai chose ' Western food ' as their preferred option for dinner out . "  
In the nearly 60 years since the end of World War II , societies around the world have undergone breathtaking transformations . The tide of industrialization has carried hundreds of millions of rural youth away from the land to work in urban factories , bringing about the disintegration of the traditional multi-generational extended family . Without the cohesion and support of the clan , it is a tall order for these young people to build and maintain stable , happy , mutually reliant families .  
Before the 1960s , one third of Taiwan families were classified as " patriarchal families . " These were " extended families " consisting of both direct and co-lateral family members living together . After the 1980s the proportion of " blended families " ( a " stem " family composed of three directly related generations ) increased . Today it is the " nuclear family " of husband , wife and children that has become the norm .  
Leaving aside families " in name only , " whether it 's the " single-parent family , " the " second family " ( after remarriage , bringing children from a previous marriage ) , the " geographically divided family , " or the " pseudo-single-parent family " ( one spouse absent for extended periods ) , they all have increased with surprising speed .

Before the war , he only hunted animals , or perhaps would take part in an occasional " headhunting ceremony .

With wisdom and intelligence , the people of the Han institutionalized the country 's political , economic and social systems , laying down the framework for the subsequent development of Chinese society .

A period of cultural flowering ensued in the south .

But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C .

The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland .

In the nearly 60 years since the end of World War II , societies around the world have undergone breathtaking transformations . The tide of industrialization has carried hundreds of millions of rural youth away from the land to work in urban factories , bringing about the disintegration of the traditional multi-generational extended family .
