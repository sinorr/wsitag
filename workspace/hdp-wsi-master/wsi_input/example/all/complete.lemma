The reason for this is that no organization - - not even the art galleries , with their more limited scope - - had ever been capable of bringing together artists and answering their need for a congenial place in which to show their works .

What a hot topic of conversation this has been over the ages ! One imaginative theory holds that dragons are bolts of lightning . As large numbers of dinosaur bones have been unearthed this century in China , views from a proper perspective of the more complete skeletons have given many a startling and eerie sense of recognition . If the Chinese painted the dragon based on an awe-inspiring subject and artists creatively enhanced their rendering of it , dinosaurs skeletons might just be what excited the imaginations of the ancient Chinese to depict dragons .  
Because of the rising and falling of geological strata and the alluviation of rivers , most dinosaur skeletons exist only in fragments ; very few are complete . But it is easy to imagine that the ancient Chinese were no less astonished by finding a " dragon skeleton " than their scientifically enlightened descendants are today when finding a dinosaur fossil .  
For instance , one stretch of road runs along the narrow point of a precipice . Although the outer ledge is protected by railing , one feels a sense of complete exhilaration .

Lu Kuang-yang says that although musk deer , certain tortoises and horned toads are protected animals , if there is clear documentation about the sources of domestically sold medicinal ingredients and a ban on the use of threatened species , then associations of doctors and pharmacists can control themselves . With the Board of Foreign Trade handling all imports , medicinal ingredients can be stamped to show that they are legal and thus prevent smuggling .

But with the present lack of an overall system of control , conservationists agree with the Department of Health 's extreme step of a temporary complete ban on medicinal ingredients taken from protected animals ; otherwise the situation will arise where legal behavior will obscure illegal behavior .  
One has the feeling of getting a complete picture of Taiwan , and the magazine 's simple style makes for absorbing reading . In the past , people did not well understand conditions on the other side of the Taiwan Strait , and with Chinese people 's penchant for extreme views , if it was not seen as poor and backward , corrupt and decadent and with declining moral values , then it was seen as a place where everything was better , an earthly paradise where the streets are paved with gold .  
Into the modern eraThe Directorate-General of Telecommunications ( DGT ) is located on a street corner behind the presidential offices . The DGT building has rounded corners , lines wrapping horizontally under the window sills ( rather than vertical lines which carry one 's eye up and down the building ) , rectangular windows instead of arched ones , bright coloring , and a complete absence of decorative embellishment .

If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious .

Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
In the past , depictions of nature often stopped short at the level of hypochondriac moaning . Today we should write slowly and deliberately about our personal , genuine environment , about the full range of phenomena , and we should employ all the different forms of literature . Good works , even works of complete philosophical reflection , will then arise .  
The complete extinction 65 million years ago of the dinosaurs - - the subjects of unlimited imaginings of us latter-day creatures - - was a seemingly calamitous and tragic event which left no survivors . But in fact the average rate at which the dinosaurs died out was equivalent to one species every thousand years . Even if humans had been alive at the time , we could not easily have observed the course of their demise .  
Thirty years ago , an American director and cinematographer named Morton Heilig , inspired by 3-D films , had the " wild idea " of developing a " total illusion of reality " which would encompass sight , smell , motion , and sound . He declared that audiences would enjoy complete and realistic sensory stimulation .  
The first time that I had written and delivered a speech in Mandarin . The first time that I had attended a Christian church service conducted entirely in Mandarin . The first time that I had celebrated Chinese New Year with my relatives in Taoyuan complete with hot pot ( huo guo ) , sticky rice cake ( nian gao ) , and a lucky red envelope ( hong bao ) . The first time that I had attended a traditional Chinese wedding .  
In fact , direct sales takes hard work , and requires a complete commitment of one 's whole person ( intellectual , physical , and emotional ) , time , and maybe even family ( with parents and siblings brought into the sales network ) . Results are only likely to be visible after three to five years , and it 's a one-in-a-million shot that one can grit one 's teeth and hang in until becoming a big player .  
This is of course sharing honor belonging to Sima Guang [ the original author ] , but I did make two contributions : ( 1 ) I made recondite classical Chinese understandable , and ( 2 ) I have given Chinese-or foreigners interested in uncovering the splendor of Chinese history-a chance to gain a complete familiarity by reading just one work . Nothing can substitute for it .  
Li describes a six-hour procedure in which he participated : The patient was suffering from a malignant tumor on the common bile duct , which connects to the hepatic duct , bile duct , and pancreatic duct . Because it affected so many organs , the surgery was extremely difficult . Seven persons-the assistant chief of the hospital , a chief resident , a resident , an anesthe-siologist , and three nurses-labored for those six hours to complete the job .  
A little later , when the inspection was complete and everyone was getting ready to return to Taipei , just as the bus driver started the engine a local official responsible for ancient monuments rushed aboard the bus to express his views to the assembled committee members .  
Although the surveyors were very hesitant to reopen the dispute , in order to complete their duties as civil servants they just put their heads down and plowed ahead , notifying the two to come out and identify their boundary . As expected , each of the two had his own version . But at least now there was a formal record that could be taken to a mediation committee for a compromise solution , thus allowing the surveyors to get through this risky " mission impossible . "  
However , because these organizations are all run by private individuals or civic groups , and are constantly being changed in response to social problems , to date no complete statistical survey has been done which would accurately reflect the actual resources which can be provided by Taiwan 's halfway houses .  
As one author puts it with complete confidence in a book published only a few years ago , when the gates of China were forced open in the nineteenth century , " the dreadful truth leaked out : the scale of the gardens of the mandarins compared to their equivalents in England rather as the bonsai does to the beech . " With such a world of difference between the Chinese and the English garden , the two should not be spoken of in the same breath . Mountain buildings , myriad torrents  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
COA officials emphasize that after the " Draft Revisions to the Agricultural Development Regulations " are passed , the primary task will be to do a complete survey to identify all current illegal use of agricultural land . At present , much vital farmland that is strictly prohibited for other purposes has in fact been misused . Observation of the principle of " agricultural use only for land zoned as agricultural land " must be rigorously ensured before restrictions on selling farmland are lifted .  
Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
Such questions are ignored , as are the intangible emotional aspects of morality , such as self-esteem , self-respect , caring for others , and even a sense of shame , a sense of guilt , moral courage and so on . Thus morality can easily become superficial or even a complete sham , adopted for show but not practiced in reality . In other words , under these circumstances moral actions never advance beyond the stage of " heteronomous morality " [ imposed by outside authority ] , and are unlikely to come from the heart .  
A well-bred cat , fresh from the pet store , besides being of pure breeding and refined appearance , will also come complete with fortune-telling tables , astrological charts , and Yi Jing readings ( to forecast the likely relationship between cat and owner ) ; these documents will foretell whether the cat will be happy in its new home .  
During the Sino-Japanese war of 1895 , the northern fleet was completely destroyed . By the time of the collective foreign invasion during the Boxer Rebellion , there was complete psychological collapse among the Chinese masses , and the Qing government finally realized the seriousness of the problem of having a population living in ignorance .  
Because Taiwan occupies an important strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region , and because the US has always paid close attention to developments in the Taiwan Strait , if the PRC could not achieve a rapid and complete victory in an outright conflict , there would be numerous opportunities for foreign powers to intervene politically or militarily . This would be extremely disadvantageous to the PRC .  
Chung argues that at the current stage Chinese medicine can still not achieve true integration with Western medicine . It is still seen by Western medical professionals only as supplementary , as helping out where Western medicine has failed , or as a partial substitute . " Integration , properly understood , is not taking something from A to plug a hole in B , but is a complete melding together of the two traditions . " This will require great deal of effort in the next century .  
Spending over 3000 hours with the caltrop birds over four and a half years , I have grown with them and seen them go from being ordinary birds to being noticed by conservationists and gradually becoming celebrities . But with the headlong rush to development and a complete lack of any effective plan for preserving their habitat , I am afraid that in the end they will once again be ignored .  
" Actually , controlling aging does n't mean rejecting aging . It means healthy , successful aging . " Dr . Wang says , " Aging is a natural , gradual , lifelong process . It is not the complete loss of one 's health and beauty within a very short period .  
For being and nonbeing give rise to each other , difficulty and ease complete each other , long and short reveal each other . . . . " This too displays Laozi 's characteristic way of thinking : everything in the manifest world comes in relative and complementary pairs , and human value judgements are mostly born of relativity .  
This center covers over 10,000 square meters . It is spacious and transport is convenient . It is said that during Tseng Kuang-shun 's time as director of Taiwan 's Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee the property was acquired through the efforts of two center directors . Cheng Hsin-pen made initial arrangements and Liang Po-chien signed the contract to complete the deal .  
The Taiwan Garrison Command was established in 1958 , assuming complete control over martial law , police functions , entry to and exit from Taiwan , media and cultural censorship , postal spying , and military trials ( which could also be used in civilian cases ) .  
Such occurrences might sound like complete fantasy to someone who has never practiced martial arts before . Chan wants to try and use modern scientific methods to explain these phenomena . " I 've been fortunate enough to win medals . This good fortune has come about thanks to good karma from a previous existence . "  
" During this final transitional year , " comments an editorial in the China Times , " Lee Teng-hui must do three things : construct a new parliamentary system , complete the nomination of the Kuomintang 's presidential candidate and assist in the election , and achieve a transition in political power that maintains a stable social structure . "  
Donations have come pouring in by the truckload-instant noodles , mineral water , crackers , sleeping bags , blankets-and medical personnel have also swarmed to the area , but a lack of coordination has resulted in an excess of personnel and materiel in some areas and a complete lack in others . When well-equipped international rescue operations arrived at the disaster area , the lack of information forced many of them to set out on their own in search of victims . In some cases , five or six different rescue groups converged on a single site .  
From today 's perspective we see that although the government has maintained a continuous , unbroken hold on Taiwan , it long since underwent significant changes : from the tight control over the country in the early years , when the national leader was supreme , to the no-holds-barred democracy of today ; from a reverential attachment to Confucian orthodoxy and the complete rejection of any notion that the leadership could content itself with ruling just a small fragment of the original country , to today 's chaotic national identity .  
On the other hand , Mu Huai-ling of VGH points out that even when one does go in for a rich feast at the New Year , it is better to eat fish than meat , better to eat lean meat than streaky pork complete with its rind and fat , and better to eat sea cucumber than cholesterol-rich mullet roe or crab eggs ; in short , you ca n't go wrong by cutting down on meat and eating plenty of vegetables , fruit and whole grains .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
Lin Shih-hua also recommends that consumers be wary of online retailers who offer goods at prices which seem too good to be true . Often , excited consumers rush to complete their transactions only to discover that they are responsible for hefty shipping charges .  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
Putting the public interest first As for the " three links " ( direct cross-strait communications , transportation , and postal links ) and the " go slow " approach that has guided cross-strait policy in recent years , Tsai Ing-wen says , " Right now cross-strait exchanges far outweigh the three links . We can not relax our policy unconditionally , as we must first complete an assessment of national security , taking a look at policy risks and only then considering what procedures to follow in relaxing policy .  
Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs . It 's not just anyone who is cut out for this pursuit , for frogs are especially active at night , when most people are in dreamland . He explores dark forests , deep valleys , and remote watercourses , searching for the 31 species of frogs and toads in Taiwan . He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
The 15-member committee finished its three-month review on September 15 without coming to a conclusive decision , with individual committee members in sharp disagreement over the per-kilowatt cost of nuclear power , the cost of canceling construction , and the cost to society of having a nuclear plant in operation . Many have criticized the Re-Evaluation Committee as " a complete waste of money , time , and energy . "  
" Taipei is struggling to catch up with Tokyo , Singapore and Hong Kong , and it has cities like Shanghai , Beijing , and Bangkok running fast on its heels , " says Chen . Chen points out that with the PRC lavishing resources on Shanghai , the city was able to complete its highway and put its electric cables underground in just two years . It was even able to lay down an entire fiber optic network .  
Where they had once viewed the island as a convenient port of call for their merchant vessels , they now schemed to take complete control . Awakened to the dangers posed by aggressive foreign powers , the Qing court dispatched Shen Baozhen in 1874 to develop Taiwan 's infrastructure and strengthen its defenses . The work started by Shen was continued by Ding Richang , who arrived in 1876 . In order to make sure that foreign powers would n't have any further opportunity for incursions into northern Taiwan , Shen had Taipei elevated to prefectural status .  
This elegant gent before me , dressed in a silk shirt and a dark brown woolen suit with a light , fine check pattern , savoring his coffee and chatting about French films , this classical music lover with a penchant for refined European life , looks utterly the product of a comfortable , happy upbringing . Who would have thought that a stream of bitterly painful childhood memories would flood through his book-memories that came as a complete surprise even to friends who know him well .  
In addition to plentiful sunshine and ample rains , the area abounds in natural resources . It is also a virtual second home to many species of migratory bird . Throughout its history-from its aboriginal days as Orchid Village , to its Qing dynasty incarnation as Hengchun ( " Eternal Spring " ) , and even to its present form , complete with national parks and farms providing tourist accommodations-Heng-chun has always pricked the interest of visitors .  
Zhang noted that students following the Russian textbook would n't complete their study of basic grammar until they had nearly finished high school . Feeling that this was not a good way to raise the standard of students ' Russian , Zhang isolated important and regular structures-things like changing the part of speech of words , the use of verbs , sentence structure and compound sentences-and taught them early on .  
In the years that followed Lan taught himself the historian 's craft and collected a rich store of materials which , as he explains , were the origin of his latest book : " I had collected a wealth of materials waiting to be classified and arranged , but the stories of these five women provided me with the most complete source for shedding light on the true face of the female victims of the White Terror . "  
In the novel , humans have long since created intelligent computers , the Earth is in the complete control of a cosmic computer alliance , all material needs are met , the genetic codes of all organisms have been fully decoded , the human dream of eternal youth has been realized , and humans can acquire all kinds of knowledge at any time through the network communication systems that they carry with them .  
Thanks to Lukang 's early prosperity , which brought many arts and crafts masters from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in mainland China to teach in Taiwan , Lukang has always been famous throughout the island for its artisanship . In early days , when someone 's daughter was getting married , there was no more demonstrative gift than a complete set of traditional Lukang furniture inlaid with precious metals and shells .  
Fortunately , when the integrated nine-year curriculum goes into effect , there will be more time devoted to sex education in junior high and elementary school classrooms . The education will provide the kids with a more complete understanding of sexual issues , including discussions about ethics , behavioral changes , and self-protection . These classes are not just going to focus on sensationalistic aspects of sex .  
To achieve this , CGCG has specially developed a production management system that breaks down the tasks involved in producing each scene into different categories . Designers are responsible for designing the characters , animators are responsible for adding movements , and other processes such as adding color , lighting and special effects are also handled by specialists . All these tasks are conducted simultaneously to reduce the amount of time needed to complete the project .  
Forging ahead as newlyweds , our only saving grace ended up being our roots . The wedding ceremony , here in the States , was what you would call a " traditional Western ceremony , " complete with a small white church , limousine and long white wedding grown . Benjamin survived that part just fine but it was the reception I worried about , as that 's when my Italian heritage truly blossomed .  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
Mrs . Lin originally planned to have Chia-hsun complete her undergraduate studies in Taiwan before going on to do advanced studies overseas . " But now , with education policies chopping and changing , I 'm worried that she will lose her international competitiveness , so perhaps we 'll send her to study overseas earlier , " says Mrs . Lin .  
In mid April , the usually inky green , stiff and subdued Formosan rhododendron undergoes a complete change of character , suddenly bursting forth in a riot of blossoms that range in color from white to pink .  
The site-which has been a tourist attraction ever since the quake hit-has been preserved and turned into an earthquake education park , complete with a museum . If you come by here you 'll not only get a better understanding of the awesome power of nature , but the gigantic enlarged photographs and videos will evoke powerful memories in any Taiwanese who experienced the 921 temblor .  
Chronologically speaking , each segment in the process was tightly linked . A MOE-certified candidate who completed teacher training in the summer of 1999 would then have to move on to the next phase of earning education credits at an academic institution by September ; 40 credits later , the prospective instructor would then have to locate an elementary school at which to complete the one year internship . Only strict adherence to this schedule would lead to a complete MOE endorsement - - a teacher 's certificate - - by September , 2001 .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
But over the past few years Taiwan railroads have suddenly experienced a retro revival and have become quite the fashion . Colorful tourist trains started running during the Millennium Year , and all at once there was a complete change in style as the Neiwan , Chichi and Pinghsi branch lines and Alishan Forestry Railway became hot tourist attractions . Train tickets from the auspiciously named " Eternal Peace and Vigor " route have sold in the tens of thousands . Convenience stores began selling boxed lunch prepared just the way they used to be served on trains .  
Although pressure for economic reform is gaining momentum in the international community , the PRC authorities see control of information as the final line of defense , and thus keep a tight grasp on it . However , this is already being put to the test by Western and Japanese companies , through running their own advertising fronts and licensing out their titles , staking their claims before the complete lifting of restrictions , and using their massive capital bases to secure their positions .  
Nita Ing says that construction on the high-speed rail project is 60% complete . This includes the civil engineering work , which is 100% complete . Work on train stations , tracks , maintenance bases and electronic , electrical and mechanical systems is well underway . Ing is confident that the entire project will be completed on schedule by the end of next year .  
The Council 's current practices , characterized by the closed and secret nature of the vast majority of the substantive deliberations of its members , make it ever more necessary to meet our demand for an analytical , complete and integral report .  
Mining and investment institutions are attracted to jurisdictions where the rules are simple and complete , the bureaucracy is efficient , mineral tenure is secure , and the general positioning of the mineral resource is competitive on a worldwide scale .  
The rapid and complete collapse of the previous system in the last years of the 1980s was characterized by a demoralizing and debilitating paralysis of the political , economic , financial , administrative and social structures of the country .  
Those forces conducting port operations continued building a sustainment base , and the multinational force established a complete headquarters for the Joint Task Force commander in the PortauPrince industrial complex .  
The Commission shall create a database intended to be a complete and standardized record on alleged grave violations of international humanitarian law committed on the territory of Rwanda including possible acts of genocide .  
A complete understanding of Iraq 's technical capabilities , manufacturing equipment , precursor suppliers and past chemical weapon production activities are essential if the Commission is to be confident that it is monitoring from a solid base .  
They emphasized the fact that the Moroccan nation was historically and constitutionally a single indivisible whole , but they wondered why censuses and studies carried out by the authorities employed only socio-economic and not racial , ethnic or linguistic criteria , which would give a more complete idea of the composition of the population .  
They justify the drafting of new international instruments to complete the existing legal arsenal , so that those who continue to perpetrate cruel and inhuman acts , genocide and ethnic cleansing can be punished .  
We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .  
However , the nuclear testing undertaken right afterwards caused disillusion in international public opinion and has made it imperative for all nations first and foremost the nuclear-weapon States to redouble their efforts in a fully responsible manner , so as to complete the comprehensive test-ban treaty in the course of the next year .  
First , France has not announced its intention to continue its nuclear testing indefinitely ; on the contrary , we have stated our decision to complete it by engaging in a final series limited to a few tests , which will be concluded before 31 May 1996 .  
Since its independence in 1956 , Tunisia has engaged in a comprehensive campaign to free Tunisians from poverty , ignorance and disease , as well as to ensure dignity and to build the basis for a modern national State as part of a complete development strategy based on investment in the human factor , and aimed at building a fully-balanced society that embraces all its segments without distinction .  
These obligations include achieving complete nuclear disarmament , expanding the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , strengthening the role and enhancing the authority of the IAEA as the only international body competent to oversee the good-faith discharge of Member States ' responsibilities under the Treaty , ensuring the universality of the NPT as an urgent priority , and establishing the Middle East as a zone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
In this regard , despite extensive damage caused by the imposed war and other economic pressures , the Islamic Republic of Iran , endowed with the resolve and work ethic of its entire population , has been able not only to move towards reversing the vast destruction of the war , but also successfully to complete its first five-year economic and social development plan and embark upon the implementation of the second five-year plan on solid foundations .  
Basing itself upon those principles and aspirations , Peru welcomes the thinking that is taking place during this fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and believes that the Organization should give serious thought to its future and to the course which international society is taking , so as to achieve a more complete vision encompassing different international realities based upon mutual respect and fairness among Member States .  
All armed action or repressive measures of all kinds directed against dependent peoples shall cease in order to enable them to exercise peacefully and freely their right to complete independence , and the integrity of their national territory shall be respected .  The Declaration , which was adopted without a dissenting vote , was an expression of the world 's desire to speed up the liberation of colonial peoples .  
We therefore consider it our obligation to reiterate once again that the ultimate solution to the problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices in various parts of the world is to achieve a complete ban on the production , stockpiling , exporting and proliferation of this type of inhumane weapon , and the future efforts of the international community must be directed towards this objective . 
There was also established a comprehensive phased programme with agreed time-frames for progressive and balanced reduction of stockpiles of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time .  
I express my fervent hope that the successful conclusion of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) this year and the indefinite extension of the Treaty will help to strengthen its effective implementation and speed progress towards the ultimate goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
We agreed , in New York in May , to the determined pursuit of global reduction of nuclear weapons , with the ultimate goal of their elimination , and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Secondly , the elimination of nuclear weapons , whether immediate or gradual , would certainly lead to the attainment of a world free of nuclear weapons and eventually of all weapons of mass destruction and would facilitate complete and general disarmament which , in turn , would ease tensions in the world at large and help redirect financial and other resources to economic and social development .  
My delegation believes that all possible measures must be sought to put an end to illicit arms transfers and , in conformity with the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly , the first devoted to disarmament , all arms suppliers and recipients should coordinate their policies on the limitation of all types of international transfers of conventional weapons for achieving the ultimate goal of complete transparency in this field .  
In this so-called new era in which bipolar confrontation no longer exists , it is especially regrettable that the international community should be unable to arrive at a firm commitment on nuclear disarmament and on the complete elimination of these weapons of mass destruction , which continue to endanger the very survival of the human race .  
At its 852nd ( closing ) meeting , on 30 September 1994 , the Board took note of document TD / B / 41 ( 1 ) / L . 7 , containing elements for the provisional agenda for the pre-sessional executive session of the Board in Spring 1995 , and requested the Officer-in-Charge of UNCTAD to complete the draft provisional agenda in the light of developments and to submit it for approval , early in 1995 , to the consultative machinery established by paragraph 83 of the Cartagena Commitment .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
We consider that the countries that are participating in ECOWAS and in the ECOWAS Military Observer Group ( ECOMOG ) are playing a key role in preventing Liberia from sliding into complete military and political anarchy and in preventing the breakup of the country which , without any doubt , would have serious negative consequences for the entire region .  
Unless a significantly more effective approach to land resources management is adopted now , a possible scenario could include a large increase in poverty , hunger , social instability , war , greatly increased migration from resource-poor environments to more favourable ones , together with almost complete destruction of the remaining natural environment and possibly modifications to the world 's climate which will cause social upheaval and political unrest on a vast scale .  
There is far less enthusiasm now for sudden sharp changes in policies ( shock therapy ) than for slow , piecemeal and gradual changes in the light of the more stable and rapid growth in the centrally planned economies in Asia in contrast to disruptions and slow recovery of those in Europe , where changes were complete and sharp .  
On the other hand , some delegations held the view that there was an inseparable link between the procedural law contained in the draft statute and the substantive law of the draft Code , and suggested that , for the Court to function effectively , it was essential to complete the work of the draft Code , which would substantially clarify the Court 's jurisdiction ratione materiae .  
The above notwithstanding , the wording of subparagraph ( c ) providing that the Court should apply " to the extent applicable , any rule of national law " was considered as too vague by some representatives , who called for more specific language bearing in mind that international law did not yet contain a complete statement of substantive and procedural criminal law . 
China hoped that the United States of America and the Russian Federation would implement existing nuclear-disarmament treaties as scheduled and carry out further drastic cuts in their respective nuclear arsenals , thereby creating the necessary conditions for the commencement of multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations with the participation of all nuclear-weapon States in order to conclude a convention on the complete prohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons . 
Four of the five nuclear-weapon States and some of their allies had taken a clear position on the Treaty 's indefinite and unconditional extension , but with regard to such matters as the pace of the negotiations on a complete test-ban treaty , peaceful nuclear explosions , the future of nuclear energy for civilian purposes and negative security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States , the overall impression was that it was business as usual .  
At the global level , a significant number of the inhabitants of our planet continue to be chronically poor ; nearly 35 per cent of the adult population are still illiterate , two thirds of whom are women ; 30 per cent of school age children do not complete primary school ; over 40 per cent in the developing countries are without basic services .  
The election on 29 June 1993 of a parliamentary majority representing FRODEBU , which gained 65 of the 81 seats in the National Assembly , made his victory over the previous regime complete and strengthened his claim , which was undoubtedly legitimate , to a more active role in the country 's political , economic , social and cultural life . 
Test piece support structures and electronic units designed to combine multiple shaker units into a complete shaker system capable of providing an effective total force of 25kN , measured " bare table " , or greater , and usable in vibration test systems in paragraph 2.8.1.1 .  2.8.2 Wind-tunnels ;  
" As no consideration of the maintenance of international peace and security would be complete without acknowledging the essential role of economic and social factors both in the origin of conflicts and in the building of a durable peace , we reiterate our commitment to the establishment of a dynamic , vigorous and equitable international economic environment that decisively contributes to the stability and prosperity of all nations and peoples . "  
It is also no longer acceptable from a legal , political or humanitarian point of view for an entire people to continue to suffer because of a mere suspicion that two persons may be connected with the bombing of an aircraft based on investigations that are not yet complete .  
At the same time , since ONUSAL will be withdrawing on 30 April 1995 , the Human Rights Division has been emphasizing the urgent need to implement those parts of the peace agreements concerning human rights which are still pending , a matter which is of the utmost importance if El Salvador is to complete the framework of legal and institutional safeguards required in order to achieve democracy and lasting peace .  
In a whole range of areas , there is no halt to military actions , in clear violation of the agreements of 21 and 31 December last year between the Bosnian parties on a cease-fire and on a complete cessation of hostilities .  The situation is being aggravated by attempted offensives from the Government forces and by disproportionate responses from the Bosnian Serbs , including acts against the civilian population which is absolutely inadmissible .  
While agreeing with the need for Headquarters to become more involved in validating the aircraft requirements of all missions , the Field Administration and Logistics Division stated that " since this recommendation would involve a major policy initiative , and would consequently entail a comprehensive review , we believe it more judicious to reserve our specific comments in this regard , pending the outcome of a complete evaluation " . 
In this regard , Earthwatch is exploring the potential to use schools , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , the media and other groups in building a more complete picture of the status of species , land uses , development activities , pollution problems and other characteristics of the human and natural environment as inputs for state-of-the-environment reporting and as a basis for selective continued monitoring of national and global trends and for filling data gaps .  
Furthermore , the practice of organizing a small group into an official unit complete with a unit chief requires careful consideration given the status associated with " bosses " , and the potential for " mini " bureaucracies to develop .  19 .  In terms of specific findings relating to these small units , electronic data-processing personnel were found to have been scattered across the Division in one or two units within each Service .  
As far as Croatia is concerned such peaceful settlements imply complete restoration of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia within its internationally recognized borders , with full guarantees of minority rights given to the Serbian ethnic community in Croatia accompanied , should there be a need , by international monitoring .

According to the unofficial histories , Chu Yuan-chang 's mother was a servant in a wealthy household . By chance the master 's son was born at the very same moment as Chu Yuan-chang , but these two " companions in fate " ended up very differently - - Chu Yuan-chang rose to be emperor , while the master 's son proved a complete failure in life .  
Seeing that he had shot so much film but had n't put it in finished form , his good friend Yang Hsien-hung , a freelance writer , was even more anxious than he was , fearing he would forget exactly what he had filmed as time went by , and pressed him to complete A Record of Migratory Birds of Kuantu . He was also afraid that his woefully neglected teeth would cause a serious health problem , and he asked a schoolmate of his to fix them for free .  
The Northern Hsiung-nu were defeated in a military expedition led by Tou Hsien and Pan Ch'ao and driven away to " Ta-tse , " but " no one knows what became of them eventually . " Having vanished from Chinese history around the first century A . D . , the Hsiung-nu resurfaced in European history in the fourth century when they crossed the Don in pursuit of the westward-fleeing Alans and won complete victory in a great battle with the Ostrogoths and Visigoths , after which they established a kingdom on the Hungarian plain .  
This traditional " matchmaker " field , which one would have thought would have been wiped out by free choice in love and marriage , is not only alive and kicking ; in the last ten years it has experienced a complete turnaround to become a hot profession . Besides the matchmaking columns and programs popular in the media , an even greater number of specialized , commercialized " modern super matchmakers " are popping up everywhere .  
The Elizabethan-style Tsubouchi Memorial Theater Museum , built in commemoration of the dramatist Shoyo Tsubouchi , is one of a kind in the entire country . Dr . Tsubouchi translated the complete works of Shakespeare into Japanese and introduced audiences to the works of Ibsen , Gorky and other European playwrights . Japan was very conservative at the time , and staging these early 20th century pieces , which were defiant of social taboos and convention , was daring and sensational .  
TSC imported a complete hothouse facility from the Netherlands , but within half a year an intense electrical storm had knocked out the computer that controlled the temperature . They sought help from Holland , but were shocked when their counterpart asked for NT $ 500,000 . This fortified their determination to " develop a greenhouse suited to Taiwan , " states Center director Hu Chun-kwang .  
What a hot topic of conversation this has been over the ages ! One imaginative theory holds that dragons are bolts of lightning . As large numbers of dinosaur bones have been unearthed this century in China , views from a proper perspective of the more complete skeletons have given many a startling and eerie sense of recognition . If the Chinese painted the dragon based on an awe-inspiring subject and artists creatively enhanced their rendering of it , dinosaurs skeletons might just be what excited the imaginations of the ancient Chinese to depict dragons .  
Because of the rising and falling of geological strata and the alluviation of rivers , most dinosaur skeletons exist only in fragments ; very few are complete . But it is easy to imagine that the ancient Chinese were no less astonished by finding a " dragon skeleton " than their scientifically enlightened descendants are today when finding a dinosaur fossil .  
For instance , one stretch of road runs along the narrow point of a precipice . Although the outer ledge is protected by railing , one feels a sense of complete exhilaration . This is also the location along the trail with the finest vantage point . One can view from after the river bluffs of Lushui and look straight down upon the torrential Liwu River dropping down , the Central Cross Island Highway at its foot .  
Lu Kuang-yang says that although musk deer , certain tortoises and horned toads are protected animals , if there is clear documentation about the sources of domestically sold medicinal ingredients and a ban on the use of threatened species , then associations of doctors and pharmacists can control themselves . With the Board of Foreign Trade handling all imports , medicinal ingredients can be stamped to show that they are legal and thus prevent smuggling . With " complete rules of the game , " he would then not object to unthreatened animals being used in limited quantities .  
But with the present lack of an overall system of control , conservationists agree with the Department of Health 's extreme step of a temporary complete ban on medicinal ingredients taken from protected animals ; otherwise the situation will arise where legal behavior will obscure illegal behavior .  
One has the feeling of getting a complete picture of Taiwan , and the magazine 's simple style makes for absorbing reading . In the past , people did not well understand conditions on the other side of the Taiwan Strait , and with Chinese people 's penchant for extreme views , if it was not seen as poor and backward , corrupt and decadent and with declining moral values , then it was seen as a place where everything was better , an earthly paradise where the streets are paved with gold .  
Into the modern eraThe Directorate-General of Telecommunications ( DGT ) is located on a street corner behind the presidential offices . The DGT building has rounded corners , lines wrapping horizontally under the window sills ( rather than vertical lines which carry one 's eye up and down the building ) , rectangular windows instead of arched ones , bright coloring , and a complete absence of decorative embellishment . All these features declare that this is an edifice composed after 1920 and linked to European " modern " architecture .  
If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious . The mass media is continually emphasizing that good academic work is not enough , and that a complete education should give equal emphasis to ethics , physical education , group consciousness , and fine arts as well . Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
In the past , depictions of nature often stopped short at the level of hypochondriac moaning . Today we should write slowly and deliberately about our personal , genuine environment , about the full range of phenomena , and we should employ all the different forms of literature . Good works , even works of complete philosophical reflection , will then arise .  
The complete extinction 65 million years ago of the dinosaurs - - the subjects of unlimited imaginings of us latter-day creatures - - was a seemingly calamitous and tragic event which left no survivors . But in fact the average rate at which the dinosaurs died out was equivalent to one species every thousand years . Even if humans had been alive at the time , we could not easily have observed the course of their demise .  
Thirty years ago , an American director and cinematographer named Morton Heilig , inspired by 3-D films , had the " wild idea " of developing a " total illusion of reality " which would encompass sight , smell , motion , and sound . He declared that audiences would enjoy complete and realistic sensory stimulation .  
The first time that I had written and delivered a speech in Mandarin . The first time that I had attended a Christian church service conducted entirely in Mandarin . The first time that I had celebrated Chinese New Year with my relatives in Taoyuan complete with hot pot ( huo guo ) , sticky rice cake ( nian gao ) , and a lucky red envelope ( hong bao ) . The first time that I had attended a traditional Chinese wedding .  
In fact , direct sales takes hard work , and requires a complete commitment of one 's whole person ( intellectual , physical , and emotional ) , time , and maybe even family ( with parents and siblings brought into the sales network ) . Results are only likely to be visible after three to five years , and it 's a one-in-a-million shot that one can grit one 's teeth and hang in until becoming a big player .  
This is of course sharing honor belonging to Sima Guang [ the original author ] , but I did make two contributions : ( 1 ) I made recondite classical Chinese understandable , and ( 2 ) I have given Chinese-or foreigners interested in uncovering the splendor of Chinese history-a chance to gain a complete familiarity by reading just one work . Nothing can substitute for it .  
Li describes a six-hour procedure in which he participated : The patient was suffering from a malignant tumor on the common bile duct , which connects to the hepatic duct , bile duct , and pancreatic duct . Because it affected so many organs , the surgery was extremely difficult . Seven persons-the assistant chief of the hospital , a chief resident , a resident , an anesthe-siologist , and three nurses-labored for those six hours to complete the job .  
A little later , when the inspection was complete and everyone was getting ready to return to Taipei , just as the bus driver started the engine a local official responsible for ancient monuments rushed aboard the bus to express his views to the assembled committee members .  
Although the surveyors were very hesitant to reopen the dispute , in order to complete their duties as civil servants they just put their heads down and plowed ahead , notifying the two to come out and identify their boundary . As expected , each of the two had his own version . But at least now there was a formal record that could be taken to a mediation committee for a compromise solution , thus allowing the surveyors to get through this risky " mission impossible . "  
However , because these organizations are all run by private individuals or civic groups , and are constantly being changed in response to social problems , to date no complete statistical survey has been done which would accurately reflect the actual resources which can be provided by Taiwan 's halfway houses .  
As one author puts it with complete confidence in a book published only a few years ago , when the gates of China were forced open in the nineteenth century , " the dreadful truth leaked out : the scale of the gardens of the mandarins compared to their equivalents in England rather as the bonsai does to the beech . " With such a world of difference between the Chinese and the English garden , the two should not be spoken of in the same breath . Mountain buildings , myriad torrents  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
COA officials emphasize that after the " Draft Revisions to the Agricultural Development Regulations " are passed , the primary task will be to do a complete survey to identify all current illegal use of agricultural land . At present , much vital farmland that is strictly prohibited for other purposes has in fact been misused . Observation of the principle of " agricultural use only for land zoned as agricultural land " must be rigorously ensured before restrictions on selling farmland are lifted .  
Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
Such questions are ignored , as are the intangible emotional aspects of morality , such as self-esteem , self-respect , caring for others , and even a sense of shame , a sense of guilt , moral courage and so on . Thus morality can easily become superficial or even a complete sham , adopted for show but not practiced in reality . In other words , under these circumstances moral actions never advance beyond the stage of " heteronomous morality " [ imposed by outside authority ] , and are unlikely to come from the heart .  
A well-bred cat , fresh from the pet store , besides being of pure breeding and refined appearance , will also come complete with fortune-telling tables , astrological charts , and Yi Jing readings ( to forecast the likely relationship between cat and owner ) ; these documents will foretell whether the cat will be happy in its new home .  
During the Sino-Japanese war of 1895 , the northern fleet was completely destroyed . By the time of the collective foreign invasion during the Boxer Rebellion , there was complete psychological collapse among the Chinese masses , and the Qing government finally realized the seriousness of the problem of having a population living in ignorance .  
Because Taiwan occupies an important strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region , and because the US has always paid close attention to developments in the Taiwan Strait , if the PRC could not achieve a rapid and complete victory in an outright conflict , there would be numerous opportunities for foreign powers to intervene politically or militarily . This would be extremely disadvantageous to the PRC .  
Chung argues that at the current stage Chinese medicine can still not achieve true integration with Western medicine . It is still seen by Western medical professionals only as supplementary , as helping out where Western medicine has failed , or as a partial substitute . " Integration , properly understood , is not taking something from A to plug a hole in B , but is a complete melding together of the two traditions . " This will require great deal of effort in the next century .  
Spending over 3000 hours with the caltrop birds over four and a half years , I have grown with them and seen them go from being ordinary birds to being noticed by conservationists and gradually becoming celebrities . But with the headlong rush to development and a complete lack of any effective plan for preserving their habitat , I am afraid that in the end they will once again be ignored .  
" Actually , controlling aging does n't mean rejecting aging . It means healthy , successful aging . " Dr . Wang says , " Aging is a natural , gradual , lifelong process . It is not the complete loss of one 's health and beauty within a very short period .  
For being and nonbeing give rise to each other , difficulty and ease complete each other , long and short reveal each other . . . . " This too displays Laozi 's characteristic way of thinking : everything in the manifest world comes in relative and complementary pairs , and human value judgements are mostly born of relativity .  
This center covers over 10,000 square meters . It is spacious and transport is convenient . It is said that during Tseng Kuang-shun 's time as director of Taiwan 's Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee the property was acquired through the efforts of two center directors . Cheng Hsin-pen made initial arrangements and Liang Po-chien signed the contract to complete the deal .  
The Taiwan Garrison Command was established in 1958 , assuming complete control over martial law , police functions , entry to and exit from Taiwan , media and cultural censorship , postal spying , and military trials ( which could also be used in civilian cases ) .  
Such occurrences might sound like complete fantasy to someone who has never practiced martial arts before . Chan wants to try and use modern scientific methods to explain these phenomena . " I 've been fortunate enough to win medals . This good fortune has come about thanks to good karma from a previous existence . "  
" During this final transitional year , " comments an editorial in the China Times , " Lee Teng-hui must do three things : construct a new parliamentary system , complete the nomination of the Kuomintang 's presidential candidate and assist in the election , and achieve a transition in political power that maintains a stable social structure . "  
Donations have come pouring in by the truckload-instant noodles , mineral water , crackers , sleeping bags , blankets-and medical personnel have also swarmed to the area , but a lack of coordination has resulted in an excess of personnel and materiel in some areas and a complete lack in others . When well-equipped international rescue operations arrived at the disaster area , the lack of information forced many of them to set out on their own in search of victims . In some cases , five or six different rescue groups converged on a single site .  
From today 's perspective we see that although the government has maintained a continuous , unbroken hold on Taiwan , it long since underwent significant changes : from the tight control over the country in the early years , when the national leader was supreme , to the no-holds-barred democracy of today ; from a reverential attachment to Confucian orthodoxy and the complete rejection of any notion that the leadership could content itself with ruling just a small fragment of the original country , to today 's chaotic national identity .  
On the other hand , Mu Huai-ling of VGH points out that even when one does go in for a rich feast at the New Year , it is better to eat fish than meat , better to eat lean meat than streaky pork complete with its rind and fat , and better to eat sea cucumber than cholesterol-rich mullet roe or crab eggs ; in short , you ca n't go wrong by cutting down on meat and eating plenty of vegetables , fruit and whole grains .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
Lin Shih-hua also recommends that consumers be wary of online retailers who offer goods at prices which seem too good to be true . Often , excited consumers rush to complete their transactions only to discover that they are responsible for hefty shipping charges .  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
Putting the public interest first As for the " three links " ( direct cross-strait communications , transportation , and postal links ) and the " go slow " approach that has guided cross-strait policy in recent years , Tsai Ing-wen says , " Right now cross-strait exchanges far outweigh the three links . We can not relax our policy unconditionally , as we must first complete an assessment of national security , taking a look at policy risks and only then considering what procedures to follow in relaxing policy .  
Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs . It 's not just anyone who is cut out for this pursuit , for frogs are especially active at night , when most people are in dreamland . He explores dark forests , deep valleys , and remote watercourses , searching for the 31 species of frogs and toads in Taiwan . He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
The 15-member committee finished its three-month review on September 15 without coming to a conclusive decision , with individual committee members in sharp disagreement over the per-kilowatt cost of nuclear power , the cost of canceling construction , and the cost to society of having a nuclear plant in operation . Many have criticized the Re-Evaluation Committee as " a complete waste of money , time , and energy . "  
" Taipei is struggling to catch up with Tokyo , Singapore and Hong Kong , and it has cities like Shanghai , Beijing , and Bangkok running fast on its heels , " says Chen . Chen points out that with the PRC lavishing resources on Shanghai , the city was able to complete its highway and put its electric cables underground in just two years . It was even able to lay down an entire fiber optic network .  
Where they had once viewed the island as a convenient port of call for their merchant vessels , they now schemed to take complete control . Awakened to the dangers posed by aggressive foreign powers , the Qing court dispatched Shen Baozhen in 1874 to develop Taiwan 's infrastructure and strengthen its defenses . The work started by Shen was continued by Ding Richang , who arrived in 1876 . In order to make sure that foreign powers would n't have any further opportunity for incursions into northern Taiwan , Shen had Taipei elevated to prefectural status .  
This elegant gent before me , dressed in a silk shirt and a dark brown woolen suit with a light , fine check pattern , savoring his coffee and chatting about French films , this classical music lover with a penchant for refined European life , looks utterly the product of a comfortable , happy upbringing . Who would have thought that a stream of bitterly painful childhood memories would flood through his book-memories that came as a complete surprise even to friends who know him well .  
In addition to plentiful sunshine and ample rains , the area abounds in natural resources . It is also a virtual second home to many species of migratory bird . Throughout its history-from its aboriginal days as Orchid Village , to its Qing dynasty incarnation as Hengchun ( " Eternal Spring " ) , and even to its present form , complete with national parks and farms providing tourist accommodations-Heng-chun has always pricked the interest of visitors .  
Zhang noted that students following the Russian textbook would n't complete their study of basic grammar until they had nearly finished high school . Feeling that this was not a good way to raise the standard of students ' Russian , Zhang isolated important and regular structures-things like changing the part of speech of words , the use of verbs , sentence structure and compound sentences-and taught them early on .  
In the years that followed Lan taught himself the historian 's craft and collected a rich store of materials which , as he explains , were the origin of his latest book : " I had collected a wealth of materials waiting to be classified and arranged , but the stories of these five women provided me with the most complete source for shedding light on the true face of the female victims of the White Terror . "  
In the novel , humans have long since created intelligent computers , the Earth is in the complete control of a cosmic computer alliance , all material needs are met , the genetic codes of all organisms have been fully decoded , the human dream of eternal youth has been realized , and humans can acquire all kinds of knowledge at any time through the network communication systems that they carry with them .  
Thanks to Lukang 's early prosperity , which brought many arts and crafts masters from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in mainland China to teach in Taiwan , Lukang has always been famous throughout the island for its artisanship . In early days , when someone 's daughter was getting married , there was no more demonstrative gift than a complete set of traditional Lukang furniture inlaid with precious metals and shells .  
Fortunately , when the integrated nine-year curriculum goes into effect , there will be more time devoted to sex education in junior high and elementary school classrooms . The education will provide the kids with a more complete understanding of sexual issues , including discussions about ethics , behavioral changes , and self-protection . These classes are not just going to focus on sensationalistic aspects of sex .  
To achieve this , CGCG has specially developed a production management system that breaks down the tasks involved in producing each scene into different categories . Designers are responsible for designing the characters , animators are responsible for adding movements , and other processes such as adding color , lighting and special effects are also handled by specialists . All these tasks are conducted simultaneously to reduce the amount of time needed to complete the project .  
Forging ahead as newlyweds , our only saving grace ended up being our roots . The wedding ceremony , here in the States , was what you would call a " traditional Western ceremony , " complete with a small white church , limousine and long white wedding grown . Benjamin survived that part just fine but it was the reception I worried about , as that 's when my Italian heritage truly blossomed .  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
Mrs . Lin originally planned to have Chia-hsun complete her undergraduate studies in Taiwan before going on to do advanced studies overseas . " But now , with education policies chopping and changing , I 'm worried that she will lose her international competitiveness , so perhaps we 'll send her to study overseas earlier , " says Mrs . Lin .  
In mid April , the usually inky green , stiff and subdued Formosan rhododendron undergoes a complete change of character , suddenly bursting forth in a riot of blossoms that range in color from white to pink .  
The site-which has been a tourist attraction ever since the quake hit-has been preserved and turned into an earthquake education park , complete with a museum . If you come by here you 'll not only get a better understanding of the awesome power of nature , but the gigantic enlarged photographs and videos will evoke powerful memories in any Taiwanese who experienced the 921 temblor .  
Chronologically speaking , each segment in the process was tightly linked . A MOE-certified candidate who completed teacher training in the summer of 1999 would then have to move on to the next phase of earning education credits at an academic institution by September ; 40 credits later , the prospective instructor would then have to locate an elementary school at which to complete the one year internship . Only strict adherence to this schedule would lead to a complete MOE endorsement - - a teacher 's certificate - - by September , 2001 .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
But over the past few years Taiwan railroads have suddenly experienced a retro revival and have become quite the fashion . Colorful tourist trains started running during the Millennium Year , and all at once there was a complete change in style as the Neiwan , Chichi and Pinghsi branch lines and Alishan Forestry Railway became hot tourist attractions . Train tickets from the auspiciously named " Eternal Peace and Vigor " route have sold in the tens of thousands . Convenience stores began selling boxed lunch prepared just the way they used to be served on trains .  
Although pressure for economic reform is gaining momentum in the international community , the PRC authorities see control of information as the final line of defense , and thus keep a tight grasp on it . However , this is already being put to the test by Western and Japanese companies , through running their own advertising fronts and licensing out their titles , staking their claims before the complete lifting of restrictions , and using their massive capital bases to secure their positions .  
Nita Ing says that construction on the high-speed rail project is 60% complete . This includes the civil engineering work , which is 100% complete . Work on train stations , tracks , maintenance bases and electronic , electrical and mechanical systems is well underway . Ing is confident that the entire project will be completed on schedule by the end of next year .  
The Council 's current practices , characterized by the closed and secret nature of the vast majority of the substantive deliberations of its members , make it ever more necessary to meet our demand for an analytical , complete and integral report .  
Mining and investment institutions are attracted to jurisdictions where the rules are simple and complete , the bureaucracy is efficient , mineral tenure is secure , and the general positioning of the mineral resource is competitive on a worldwide scale .  
The rapid and complete collapse of the previous system in the last years of the 1980s was characterized by a demoralizing and debilitating paralysis of the political , economic , financial , administrative and social structures of the country .  
Those forces conducting port operations continued building a sustainment base , and the multinational force established a complete headquarters for the Joint Task Force commander in the PortauPrince industrial complex .  
The Commission shall create a database intended to be a complete and standardized record on alleged grave violations of international humanitarian law committed on the territory of Rwanda including possible acts of genocide .  
A complete understanding of Iraq 's technical capabilities , manufacturing equipment , precursor suppliers and past chemical weapon production activities are essential if the Commission is to be confident that it is monitoring from a solid base .  
They emphasized the fact that the Moroccan nation was historically and constitutionally a single indivisible whole , but they wondered why censuses and studies carried out by the authorities employed only socio-economic and not racial , ethnic or linguistic criteria , which would give a more complete idea of the composition of the population .  
They justify the drafting of new international instruments to complete the existing legal arsenal , so that those who continue to perpetrate cruel and inhuman acts , genocide and ethnic cleansing can be punished .  
We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .  
However , the nuclear testing undertaken right afterwards caused disillusion in international public opinion and has made it imperative for all nations first and foremost the nuclear-weapon States to redouble their efforts in a fully responsible manner , so as to complete the comprehensive test-ban treaty in the course of the next year .  
First , France has not announced its intention to continue its nuclear testing indefinitely ; on the contrary , we have stated our decision to complete it by engaging in a final series limited to a few tests , which will be concluded before 31 May 1996 .  
Since its independence in 1956 , Tunisia has engaged in a comprehensive campaign to free Tunisians from poverty , ignorance and disease , as well as to ensure dignity and to build the basis for a modern national State as part of a complete development strategy based on investment in the human factor , and aimed at building a fully-balanced society that embraces all its segments without distinction .  
These obligations include achieving complete nuclear disarmament , expanding the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , strengthening the role and enhancing the authority of the IAEA as the only international body competent to oversee the good-faith discharge of Member States ' responsibilities under the Treaty , ensuring the universality of the NPT as an urgent priority , and establishing the Middle East as a zone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
In this regard , despite extensive damage caused by the imposed war and other economic pressures , the Islamic Republic of Iran , endowed with the resolve and work ethic of its entire population , has been able not only to move towards reversing the vast destruction of the war , but also successfully to complete its first five-year economic and social development plan and embark upon the implementation of the second five-year plan on solid foundations .  
Basing itself upon those principles and aspirations , Peru welcomes the thinking that is taking place during this fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and believes that the Organization should give serious thought to its future and to the course which international society is taking , so as to achieve a more complete vision encompassing different international realities based upon mutual respect and fairness among Member States .  
All armed action or repressive measures of all kinds directed against dependent peoples shall cease in order to enable them to exercise peacefully and freely their right to complete independence , and the integrity of their national territory shall be respected .  The Declaration , which was adopted without a dissenting vote , was an expression of the world 's desire to speed up the liberation of colonial peoples .  
We therefore consider it our obligation to reiterate once again that the ultimate solution to the problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices in various parts of the world is to achieve a complete ban on the production , stockpiling , exporting and proliferation of this type of inhumane weapon , and the future efforts of the international community must be directed towards this objective . 
There was also established a comprehensive phased programme with agreed time-frames for progressive and balanced reduction of stockpiles of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time .  
I express my fervent hope that the successful conclusion of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) this year and the indefinite extension of the Treaty will help to strengthen its effective implementation and speed progress towards the ultimate goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
We agreed , in New York in May , to the determined pursuit of global reduction of nuclear weapons , with the ultimate goal of their elimination , and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Secondly , the elimination of nuclear weapons , whether immediate or gradual , would certainly lead to the attainment of a world free of nuclear weapons and eventually of all weapons of mass destruction and would facilitate complete and general disarmament which , in turn , would ease tensions in the world at large and help redirect financial and other resources to economic and social development .  
My delegation believes that all possible measures must be sought to put an end to illicit arms transfers and , in conformity with the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly , the first devoted to disarmament , all arms suppliers and recipients should coordinate their policies on the limitation of all types of international transfers of conventional weapons for achieving the ultimate goal of complete transparency in this field .  
In this so-called new era in which bipolar confrontation no longer exists , it is especially regrettable that the international community should be unable to arrive at a firm commitment on nuclear disarmament and on the complete elimination of these weapons of mass destruction , which continue to endanger the very survival of the human race .  
At its 852nd ( closing ) meeting , on 30 September 1994 , the Board took note of document TD / B / 41 ( 1 ) / L . 7 , containing elements for the provisional agenda for the pre-sessional executive session of the Board in Spring 1995 , and requested the Officer-in-Charge of UNCTAD to complete the draft provisional agenda in the light of developments and to submit it for approval , early in 1995 , to the consultative machinery established by paragraph 83 of the Cartagena Commitment .
