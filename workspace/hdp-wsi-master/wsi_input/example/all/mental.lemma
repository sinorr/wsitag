It is affirmed by many international instruments , the most recent of which is the Convention on the Rights of the Child , adopted by the United Nations on 20 November 1989 , article 32 of which obliges States to " recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child 's education , or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development .

The priorities pursued , which the Special Rapporteur would like to endorse , include a multidisciplinary approach , involving social services and mental health workers , to interviewing and investigation , special treatment in court settings which are child-friendly and appropriate to age and status , and continuing care in order to address the lingering effects of commercial sexual exploitation .

Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development . 
The Committee is deeply concerned by the institutionalized use of corporal punishment as a means of discipline , particularly in schools , as well as at the absence of a comprehensive law that clearly prohibits the use of both mental and physical torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment against children .  
However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .  
We uphold the traditional indigenous perspective that the mental , physical , social and spiritual well-being of our peoples and the survival of our future generations can not be separated from the health of our environment , the practice of our cultures and religions and the expression of our inherent right to self-determination .

The accused must undertake one of a series of acts - killing , causing serious bodily or mental harm ; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction ; imposing measures intended to prevent births ; and forcibly transferring children from the group ; ( b ) The accused must do so against a " national , ethnical , racial or religious group " ;

Since the enactment of proper legislation to protect children was essential to their healthy physical , mental and psychological development , Iran had adopted certain legal measures , including the establishment of special courts to protect the family , and had modified article 1173 of the civil code regarding child custody to recognize the mothers role in guardianship .  
The report indicated that in the light of those principles , all countries that had ratified the international instruments were confronted with the incompatibility that existed between the obligations they had assumed as States parties to the various agreements and the maintenance of certain traditional practices , especially since the practices had proved injurious to the physical and mental health of women and children .

Since the enactment of proper legislation to protect children was essential to their healthy physical , mental and psychological development , Iran had adopted certain legal measures , including the establishment of special courts to protect the family , and had modified article 1173 of the civil code regarding child custody to recognize the mothers role in guardianship .
