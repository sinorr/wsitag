This is because the compilation and publication that comes out of the ISI 's citation indexing database is aimed at providing services for scientific and technical information , and the items cited do not all directly affect the concrete substance of articles ; so as a type of statistical analysis product , the influence itself of the data does not have an academic evaluative content and should not be deemed the authoritative data for evaluating academic publications .  
At present , many foreign academic journals , because they have established specialized web pages on the Internet , not only have provided weekly content for articles to be published , but some have even set up links to vast information databases .

As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "  
Many practical difficulties : If children are required to study additional subject matter which is not related to future examinations , then implementing local vernacular instruction in a situation where schoolchildren are already under heavy academic pressure is bound to provoke a reaction from many sides , including the children 's parents , the pupils themselves , the schools and certain sections of society .  
In colonized areas , the nostalgia felt by expatriates for their homeland reflected itself in a growing romanticism and meticulous concern for form , symbolism , and detailed embellishment in the external appearance of the buildings they constructed . This came to be known as the " Imperial " mode , a mode which became increasingly fashionable in European academic circles after the mid-19th century .  
If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious . The mass media is continually emphasizing that good academic work is not enough , and that a complete education should give equal emphasis to ethics , physical education , group consciousness , and fine arts as well . Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
Under the Japanese occupation , Taiwanese had limited access to higher education . Lien Wen-pin , now a famous doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , went to the temple to ask about his academic future shortly before he finished high school . The poem he drew read " You climbed the high mountain to study the immortals / But then came the imperial edict / When the white sun shines forever in a blue sky / If you so desire your fame will spread across the four seas . "  
The Ministry of Education , which has jurisdiction over sunken ships , argues that Huang has always been trying to get commissioned to do the work of recovering the artifacts . However , due to academic considerations , the Ministry can not sign a contract with a single individual . Thus plans for exploring and salvaging the ships have been delayed for eight years .  
Even if his academic record was n't anything special , he worked to help support his family . He was quick at making chicken cages , and early every morning would wash and shell the dried fava beans that his mother bought at the wholesale market and sold from her front door outside the military dependents ' village . "  
Second , because the members of these societies do n't have a high level of education , the clubs are very much a part of local Taiwanese culture - - virtual reflections of common Taiwanese society . " These poetry societies were not established in the modern academic era , and so they are representative of local temple fair society , " Chien says .  
But in the view of the institute 's director Chen San-ching , since Liu Shao-tang began the magazine thirty-odd years ago , although his work can not be said to follow the traditional methods of academic research , his contribution to Chinese contemporary history has been incomparable , for he has rescued countless quantities of first-hand material including manuscripts , photographs , documents and personal memoirs , and has inspired many people who then participated actively in research and writing .  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
Chienkuo High School , generally recognized as a " star school , " has already determined that its outstanding selected students will not be judged exclusively by the standard of academic grades . Particular emphasis will also be placed on performance in activity groups , in order to " lend balance " to their current student population , whose on-campus activities lean heavily in favor of scholastic pursuits .  
Other topics include " loving a younger man " - is it shameful for a female student to become involved with a boy who is her academic junior ? - and , how to define " best friends of the opposite sex ? " The true stories that emerge through these discussions touch on the personal concerns of the participants .  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
And how can we keep this concept-along with the familiar concept of IQ , and the newly-emerging one of children 's motor intelligence ( MQ ) - from being merely fashionable phrases which are mouthed parrot-fashion , and instead allow them to help us turn back from educational methods which have been twisted by an obsession with academic success , and give back to parents the opportunity to raise physically healthy and emotionally balanced children ?  
Society in Taiwan puts paramount im-portance on academic advancement . The call for a balanced education , in which ethical , intellectual , physical , social and artistic development are given equal stress , has long been regarded as a far-off ideal that gets lip service only .  
And before the old ailment could be cured , the patient contracted a new illness : pressures for academic advancement began growing heavier and heavier . The joint entrance exam system is a modern version of the imperial civil service examination system , and it pushes down on modern children so much they scarcely can breathe .  
Just as Emotional Intelligence author Daniel Goleman has observed , many social phenomena of the last few decades have revealed that neither academic achievement nor professional ability are the sole factors leading to success . Especially in modern corporations which emphasize organizational management , such qualities as emotional balance , personability and leadership are frequently more important .  
Because the theory of EQ includes a balanced , multifaceted educational perspective that emphasizes both the mental and physical aspects of individuals ' emotions , it has not only become popular among the population at large , but has also garnered considerable interest in the academic community , being seen as compatible with the call to educational reform .  
" Obsessively focusing on EQ , " he avers , " would very likely create an undesirable subculture in which people are hypocritical , excessively complex , and adjust their behavior according to each situation in order to curry the favor of others . If this happened , we might replace the past unfair bias toward academic standing and breeding , but we would be embracing a different kind of extreme . "  
Second , Lu Hsiu-lien offered strong personal credentials : a strong academic record , a clean and fresh image , a background as a leader in the women 's movement , and her imprisonment as an early democratic activist back in the early 1980s . She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
This academic debate not only revolved around objective evidence , but also involved national sentiments and encroached on the academic turf of various researchers . This has always been a highly sensitive area , so perhaps it is not surprising that for a while a fierce battle of words raged .  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
Out of the national scientific research budget of NT $ 40 billion at that time , NT $ 18.5 billion was earmarked for defense technology research ; of the remaining NT $ 21.7 billion , NT $ 7 billion was set aside for NSC-directed academic research , and the other NT $ 14-plus billion was distributed among the various subordinate departments of the NSC for applied technology research .  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
This exchange is the first time since the break-off of negotiations that dialogue has been conducted between the two sides . The letter sent from Taiwan on March 5th received a quick and clear response on March 11th with ARATS reiterating that they were willing to invite representatives from the SEF of " a suitable level " to lead economic , cultural or academic missions to the PRC , either to visit or participate in seminars . The opportunity to restart cross-straits negotiations can be traced back to earlier this year .  
People found the case even more startling not only because had it occurred in a staid seat of higher learning , but also because all those involved came from backgrounds which did not suggest criminality or licence : Hsu Chia-chen 's father is a civil servant , and her parents gave her a strict upbringing ; and Hung Hsiao-hui had always been a " good student , " with excellent grades since childhood and a smooth academic career .  
Tsai Yuan-pei had been living in France when he received a telegram from the Ministry of Education , hoping to entice him to come back to take the reins at Beida : " The nation is returning to normal , and urgently in need of education . Now we are making your virtuous self master of the capital 's highest academic institution . "  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
According to First International Computers ' Jeff Hsue , who has also traveled to the States himself to interview applicants , Taiwan 's ability to design and produce products is hard to beat . But he says that few Taiwanese firms are involved in taking product design to a higher level , whether it be through technological developments , preliminary research or even fundamental academic research , because of the difficulties and risks involved .  
When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired . " More class time is spent explaining English than teaching subject matter , " says Professor Chi Hsi-sheng of HKUST 's Division of Social Science .  
The year before last the show " Splendors of Imperial China " was well received by the American academic and cultural communities , and afterwards many nations extended invitations to the National Palace Museum . The French government worked especially hard to meet the Musuem 's needs , even passing a new law designating measures to protect foreign art works on exhibition there . Now , 63 years after part of the National Palace Museum collection first went to Europe for a show in London in 1935 , works from the museum are going to Paris .  
These periodicals and books are of a very high standard and have a respected position in international sinology . Their diverse content includes economics , literature ( both classical and modern ) , politics , history , philosophy and so on . These publications constitute a major textual resource for academic research .  
It is worthy of note that in recent years , German sinology has gradually turned away from " pure academic sinology " - research directed entirely at studying traditional China-and has incorporated such topics as modern politics , history , sociology , commerce , culture and education to examine practical issues in China . Hot topics of current research include such questions as the relationship between Confucianist thought and China 's modernization , and various aspects of Chinese philosophy .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
And in Meinung , a red banner draped in front of the Founding Uncle altar at the East Gate , presented by a local believer , reads : " Praying for sons , for wealth and for honors ; for academic success and for peaceful well-being . " Chang An-sheng , a local senior who sweeps the altar at 4 a.m . every morning , remarks : " Old Uncle here grants whatever you request . He 's especially effective with requests for examination success ! "  
It required " a grade one vocational qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a junior college of that time ] and a grade two academic qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a three-year technical high school of that time ] . Preparing for the test was difficult . Days were hard after you went to work too , both in the training period and when you actually were working . If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
When senior Macau officials are asked about having studied in Taiwan , they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in Macau , Lisbon , or mainland China . " It 's called sanitizing your record ! " quips Tan Zhiqiang , Hong Kong and Macau bureau chief for the China Times , who was born and raised in Macau and wrote his doctoral dissertation on " The Question of Macau 's Sovereignty . "  
According to art academic Chiang Hsun , Impressionism , from which sorrow and suffering and even seriousness all seem to be absent , was a product of the first generation to enjoy the fruits of urban life following the industrial revolution . The painter Renoir was particularly fond of showing nudes posed amid nature , depicted with caressing strokes of the brush .  
" When people think about students at star schools they think in terms of students who get good grades , but being a high academic achiever is not the same thing as being gifted , " says Cheng . At Kaohsiung High , which is the most selective school in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung testing zone , quite a few of the students find the textbooks hard to follow . They are so difficult and obscure because their editors designed them to meet the needs of a small group of truly gifted students .  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it . The tension between whites and blacks in America is very obvious , and my academic training gave me a way to analyze the situation and place it in its proper historical context . I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
The situation is somewhat different in Japan , a close neighbor of Taiwan and its former colonial master for half a century , which has a more complex emotional relationship with the island . The Japanese academic community has long paid close attention to non-literary aspects of the Taiwan experience , and it is against this background that Taiwan literature is now getting more attention .  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like . Environmental protection agencies are weak , and research funding is limited . Thus there is little concrete knowledge about the numbers of various species and whether these numbers are rising or falling , not to mention any understanding of what concrete steps can be taken to solve specific problems .  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
" There are still good students who select an agricultural college on account of the academic reputation of the university , " notes Hsu . " But with the abolition of the joint entrance examination next year , agricultural colleges are concerned that there 'll be a big drop in the quality of students they can attract . " With today 's changing circumstances , it is imperative for agricultural colleges to alter their approach . It 's both a crisis , and an opportunity .  
Since 1991 more than 100 new public and private high schools ( including comprehensive high schools ) have been founded , so now there are more than 270 such institutions . Meanwhile , the ratio of students entering academic vs . vocational tracks has been adjusted to 45:55 . This means that today more than 40% of kids can keep their university dream alive after junior high school .  
However , in contrast to the relative independence of European and American think tanks , in Taiwan , where political power has always held the upper hand over pure academic research , think tanks operate with such obvious political orientations that outsiders naturally assume that think tanks are nothing but parrots reflecting the views of the powers-that-be .  
In fact , Taiwan Advocates was established in response to President Chen 's idea of a trans-party " national security alliance , " bringing together many political figures as well as social and academic elites . Taiwan Advocates aims to be " the brains of the national security alliance , " and also to link together different political forces in the Legislative Yuan . Taiwan Advocates has held few public activities , so its actual impact remains to be seen .  
In addition , Taiwan 's background as a former Japanese colony and the many Taiwanese who have studied and worked in the US give the island a human network of international dimensions . Add in the fact that the island shares a common language and culture with China and with ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia , and the tight ties between its own business , political and academic circles , and Taiwan looks to be very well positioned here at the beginning of the era of globalization .  
As for Samson Tsou , with his incomparably rich academic and professional background and experience of international agricultural practice , he intends to move into teaching and research , and hopes also to be able to make a contribution to the development of international businesses in the field of vegetable farming , and thus achieve an ideal that is also in AVDRC 's future agenda .  
Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth . Ever since the Ming loyalist Koxinga ( Zheng Chenggong ) ruled over the island in the late 17th century , almost all Chinese-language scholarship on the subject has consisted of written tracts , with very few visual images . Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
To provide guidance for future legislation , I have begun collating a compendium of local and foreign academic writings , legislation and court rulings relevant to transgender rights . With regard to the protection of homosexuals ' rights , I recently published a monograph entitled On Equal Protection for Lesbians and Gay Men , which I hope interested readers will read for themselves .  
At present , 76 US medical schools offer courses in alternative medicine . In the international academic community , bioenergetic medicine organizations are holding frequent symposia , to take the first steps toward putting the field on a sound scientific footing . They have also begun active dialogue with practitioners of Chinese and Western medicine . It looks as if the health authorities in Taiwan ought not to completely ignore alternative medicine .  
Chang Chao-tang was born to a family of doctors in Panchiao , Taipei County . A smart kid , he was granted admission to Taipei 's prestigious Cheng Kung Senior High School based on his outstanding academic record alone , so that he did n't need to take the joint entrance exam .  
" Although the pattern in international medical aid is to offer long-term aid at fixed locations , the TRMPC will at least for the near future continue its approach of not adopting any fixed location , but of doing volunteer care deep in those areas that local medical systems do not reach , " says TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun . Like explorers on the Discovery Channel , the TRMPC 's tramping through the developing world has yielded some valuable academic discoveries .  
Before the 1980s , academic work on aborigines was largely confined to anthropology . Research focused on things like the clothing , social structure , and myths and legends of the various tribes . Aboriginal culture was treated as something already dead , as a museum specimen . This type of research was of no help at all in understanding how living indigenous people were responding to changing times .  
Chronologically speaking , each segment in the process was tightly linked . A MOE-certified candidate who completed teacher training in the summer of 1999 would then have to move on to the next phase of earning education credits at an academic institution by September ; 40 credits later , the prospective instructor would then have to locate an elementary school at which to complete the one year internship . Only strict adherence to this schedule would lead to a complete MOE endorsement - - a teacher 's certificate - - by September , 2001 .  
On September 13 , the Ministry of Education held the National Education Development Conference . At the conference , the central topic for higher education was " Promoting the Quality of Higher Education to Raise International Competitiveness . " The stated objective was to have a local university enter the ranks of the world 's top hundred universities within ten years , and have at least ten key academic departments or inter-institution research centers ranked first in Asia in their respective categories .  
Over time , with the constant expansion and division of academic disciplines , new units were established , including divisions of medicine , engineering , and agricultural science , as well as graduate institutes of tropical medicine , southern civilization , and southern resources . By the time Japanese rule ended in 1945 , the university had five academic divisions , a preparatory school , three graduate institutes , and 115 academic chairs , with 378 full-time academic personnel , 123 part-time personnel and 382 students .  
When NTU absorbed the Agricultural Division of TIU , it changed its name to the College of Agriculture ( CoA ) . With seven academic departments it was NTU 's largest college . Later , the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine was split into two , and the mechanical engineering group in the agricultural engineering department became a separate department . The CoA gradually expanded to 12 departments .  
I 've noticed a trend : in recent years , a large number of works that have entered the market have been from the mainland-both original Chinese and translated works-and this has become one of the causes of the current rapid expansion of the Taiwanese book market . Moreover , these books are n't limited to the old academic and translated works , they 've now grown to include popular literature .  
Asked what areas of personal concern they feel they most need to address , respondents answered , in order of priority : job skills or professional abilities and knowledge ( 30.1% ) ; personal economic or financial situation ( 21.5% ) ; foreign language ability ( 11.2% ) ; level of academic achievement ( 9.6% ) ; quality of life or place of residence ( 5.2% ) ; and religious or spiritual growth ( 2.6% ) .  
In his third year of senior high , in connection with the inauguration of the president of Costa Rica , Wu accepted an invitation to put on a personal exhibit in Central America , but he promised to go only after the school granted him leave . While he was preparing that same academic year for graduation and the equivalency exam , his father fell seriously ill and had to go into the hospital . While at the hospital caring for his father , Wu kept worrying about failing the equivalency exam .  
Such plans all emphasize lively and vivid presentation , and putting fun into learning . But the school authorities are also very aware that some parents might think the teachers are " not doing their regular work " or just playing games with the students . For this reason they must first persuade parents to support the approach . Fortunately , the experimental plan is aimed at first-grade students who entered junior high school in 2002 and who do n't yet feel the pressures of academic testing , so resistance is minimal .  
While continuing to work in the classical field , Lee also turned his attention to pop music . He could n't stand the schmaltzy love tales that characterized Mandarin pop lyrics , and he always found the music itself excessively influenced by Japanese teeny-bopper styles . Thus he took his background in academic music and plunged headfirst into the vulgar world of pop , determined to refine the genre and bring it to a higher level .  
The erudite Buddhist master Yin-Shun , said to be " the most eminent Buddhist since Xuan Zang , " celebrated his 100th birthday in late April , on the 20th day of the third lunar month . A huge conference was held jointly by Buddhist religious and academic communities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . It was a memorable event , as many Buddhist groups in Taiwan have been inspired by Yin-Shun 's teaching , and were in attendance to mark his birthday .  
A : The process was quite convoluted . In 1979 , we submitted an article to an American academic journal . The editor thought the findings violated scientific principles , as anyone with minimal knowledge of chemistry knew that molecules could not possibly exist in such combinations , and therefore rejected the paper . Perhaps to preserve academic objectivity , they sought the additional appraisal of an authority in the field , who also judged my assumptions to be too bold , casting doubt on the conclusions .  
In order to maintain this environment while also developing the level of the more academic courses we provide , we 've decided that the best choice is to follow the example set by overseas adult education providers and adopt a " twin-track " system .  
Teachers are also very concerned about the possibility of lowered academic competence on the part of their students , given the fact that the increasingly diversified subject matter of the new integrated curriculum takes away from time spent on basic subjects .  
Chou takes the nine-year integrated curriculum as an example . Neither the idea of a system integrating the content to be studied in Grades 1-9 , nor that of academic " fields , " are new . In fact , these things had been spelled out in previous curricular standards . In past decades , however , one saw the prevalent use of " contracting out " specialized tasks within Taiwan 's education system , so much so that now that things have been opened up , people can not imagine doing otherwise .  
At my children 's school , too , there are many truly dedicated teachers who put a lot of effort into running more flexible classes and communicating with parents , making them a part of their children 's education . These teachers have a four-pronged goal for their students : emotional development , life skills , personal growth , and fundamental academic knowledge . Their achievements show that if they work together , the trio of school , teacher , and parents can be a formidable one , and one which opens the door to truly excellent education .  
Chang specifically targeted seasoned pedagogues who were at or close to retirement age , reasoning that it would be the best way to attract true lovers of the teaching profession . Such individuals would be teaching primarily for the sheer pleasure of it rather than merely for profit . The teachers ' essentially altruistic persuasion along with their experience and dedication would combine to create an academic atmosphere high in quality but low in expense .  
wang , who is a deputy to the eighth national people 's congress , told xinhua the constitutional institutes have organized scholars , teachers and judicial workers to conduct study and academic exchange through various forms they have achieved valuable academic results and promoted development of chinese constitutional theory  
to my greatest delight , an increasing number of chinese scholars are going overseas for academic meetings in recent years , many young scholars have been invited to attend and address international conferences no wonder professor t d lee , a nobel prize winner , said that chinese will have a bigger say on physics in the 21st century  
Your brilliant academic career , your outstanding diplomatic skills and your warm , personable style of leadership assured your unanimous election .  
The greatest national benefit will be obtained if the exercise is based on the overall principles adopted by in-country preparatory processes , i.e . , the participation of civic leaders , the academic and scientific community , grass-roots community leaders and non-governmental and community-based organizations , the private sector and human settlements professionals .  
Beyond your qualifications , Mr . President , as Prime Minister , Minister or Head of a democratic party posts that you have occupied or still occupy I am sure it was your standing as an academic , intellectual and man of culture that first and foremost determined that choice .  
It goes without saying that the reaffirmation by all in the academic world and in the field of the international community 's interest in recognizing and consolidating linguistic diversity must , at the same time , be accompanied by concrete actions and daily gestures to ensure harmonious , mutually beneficial and mutually fruitful existence for all cultures .  
Jamaica 's national youth policy was therefore designed to redress all these deficiencies , but first of all to bring an integrated approach to the activities of youth organizations nation wide and to equip all youth with the necessary academic , technical and life-coping skills to foster their personal development .  
In her opening statement , the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women stressed that the preparatory process at the national and regional levels had proceeded successfully owing to the strong involvement of Governments , international , political , financial and development organizations , the private sector , academic and research institutions , donors and , especially , non-governmental organizations .  
Improving the reliability , validity , utility and public availability of statistical and other information on social development and gender issues , including the effective use of gender disaggregated statistics collected at the national , regional and international levels , including through support to academic and research institutions .  
Supporting academic and research institutions particularly in the developing countries , in their contribution to social development programmes , and to facilitate the mechanisms for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of social progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about economic and social development ;  
As indicated elsewhere , there is growing cooperation with non-governmental organizations , building on the role assigned to them in Agenda 21 in relation to activities at the country level , and with centres of excellence and academic institutions , in recognition of the cross-cutting nature of desertification control , involving the social , cultural , economic and physical management of a territory .  
The active involvement of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , women 's organizations , the media , non-governmental organizations , youth organizations , cultural groups , and financial and other for-profit organizations .  
Under the heading " strengthening support for families " , proposed actions would be arranged according to the principal actors concerned : national Governments ; regional or local governments ; the private sector ; non-governmental organizations at different levels ; research and academic institutions ; the media .  
In her opening statement , the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women stressed that the preparatory process at the national and regional levels had proceeded successfully owing to the strong involvement of Governments , international political , financial and development organizations , the private sector , academic and research institutions , donors and , especially , non-governmental organizations .  
All parties involved in the development process , including academic institutions , non-governmental organizations and grass-roots and women 's groups , should mobilize to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes directed towards the poorest and most disadvantaged groups of women , such as rural and indigenous women , female heads of households , young women and older women , refugees and migrant women and women with disabilities .  
They note that an informal round table that includes representatives of all agencies , as well as members of the academic community and relevant non-governmental organizations , is useful for the purposes of developing innovative ideas and concepts relating to how development communication should be understood , as far as this concept has not yet been defined according to one universal standard .  
APINESS was set up in 1986 with a view to providing national-level academic groups in the social sciences field appropriate , relevant and pertinent international as well as indigenous data , documentation and information , so that professionals in the field of social sciences may meaningfully contribute to national development .  
The active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , non-governmental organizations , including women 's organizations and feminist groups , the media , religious groups , youth organizations and cultural groups , as well as financial and non-profit organizations .  
The results of the study would also be used for the development of special programmes , courses and curriculums for academic institutions , to ensure that theoretical knowledge is increased , improved and disseminated , and to create the basis for long-term and consistent action against organized transnational crime .  
This presentation selectively describes basic aspects of satellite remote sensing and geographic information systems ( GIS ) which must be sufficiently appreciated by users of remotely sensed data for their effective application to the national development problems or academic issues identified by the participants .  
In improving natural and human-made disaster prevention , preparedness , mitigation and response , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , and in close consultation and cooperation with such entities as insurance companies , non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , organized communities , the academic , health and scientific community , should :  
The Workshop was composed of qualified academic and governmental lawyers in their personal capacities , taking into account geographical representation ; and was based on the premise that , in moving towards sustainable development , international environmental law is inspiring new and innovative concepts , principles and ideas , and developing facilitative and enabling mechanisms and procedures in areas such as implementation and compliance and dispute avoidance and settlement .  
Some delegations noted that the classical distinction into civil and political rights as justiciable , and economic , social and cultural rights as non-justiciable could , in the light of practice , case law and academic writings , no longer be maintained .  
Among the partners in such cooperation are governments , governmental agencies , United Nations entities , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , national and local professional and scientific associations , academic institutions , private enterprises and individuals .

This is because the compilation and publication that comes out of the ISI 's citation indexing database is aimed at providing services for scientific and technical information , and the items cited do not all directly affect the concrete substance of articles ; so as a type of statistical analysis product , the influence itself of the data does not have an academic evaluative content and should not be deemed the authoritative data for evaluating academic publications .  
At present , many foreign academic journals , because they have established specialized web pages on the Internet , not only have provided weekly content for articles to be published , but some have even set up links to vast information databases . 
Although this is an extreme case in a tiny minority , it is sufficient to show : Reducing the heavy academic burden on students and fostering their fine psychological quality and legal concepts are a pressing task .

The 30-plus theses it published have attracted the attention of academic departments and higher-level administrative departments .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
We should concentrate our manpower as well as financial and material resources on building a group of high-ranking academies and universities that have clear-cut military characteristics .  We should give priority to supporting a group of academic departments and laboratories that have utmost bearing on future wars .  These academic departments and laboratories will play a role as an initiator and demonstrator for all military academies .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
In the United States , debates revolving round the NMD program are turning hotter , and voices of opposition to it getting louder , in the military and academic circles .

Many of them are teachers and students .  This may bring the impact of their administrative posts , academic status , and master-student relations into the party .  Thus , it is more necessary to intensify study , enhance the ideological and theoretical quality , strictly follow the requirement of the democratic centralist system , set aright the position of an individual , approach things from the across-the-board interests of section development .  
For instance , there are many outstanding or top-notch people of great academic attainments in society who have attained a high level in scientific research and professional skills , but military units can not enlist them because of their age and physical conditions ; in such a case , we can adopt a measure for employment under contract so that we can use their knowledge , technology , and other intellectual resources and that they can provide services for us in a certain way and at a definite time .  2 .  
Through reform , all the military 's colleges and universities should enable our military 's colleges and universities to catch up with the world 's technological progress , military revolution and trends in educational development with respect to educational concepts , infrastructure , curricular and research capabilities , and academic levels .  All military colleges and universities should create famous brands , try to be members of the first class , and make greater contributions to cultivating and supplying talented military professionals of high quality .  
It also means and is most crucial to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party , comprehensively implement both the Party 's guiding principle on education and the Central Military Commission 's requirements on running military schools , and maintain the original nature of these schools . " producing skilled students " means to foster high-quality military professionals with a comprehensive training in moral , academic , military and physical aspects and with superior qualities in all other aspects .

Political military exercises are a new type of training which the US military has added in recent years ; these can be either joint or combined , and the main characteristic is that many departments take part in such exercises and the grades are high ; apart from the military , relevant academic institutions and government departments concerned also participate .  
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the PLA training institutions at the postgraduate level built a number of key academies or schools ; developed a batch of key academic disciplines ; and set up a number of key laboratories as well , and this was a major decision made by the Central Military Commission .  
In accordance with unified arrangements laid down by the Central Military Commission , the general departments selected and built in a centralized way a batch of key academic disciplines , key laboratories , or key academies or schools on the basis of a scientific forecast and sufficient demonstration .

Such a judgment that sets academic backgrounds and knowledge against practice is a mentality of finding fault with and making excessive demands on high-quality talent ; and in the eyes of people with such a mentality , high-quality talent " are not bold and vigorous enough in their work but are holding themselves aloof , " lack mature skills in leading the troops , have insufficient drive in exercising control , and are engaged in impractical scientific research and studies .  
As a matter of fact , in analyzing the major cause to the chaotic political situation in Taiwan , the public opinion and some political and academic figures on the island pointed out in the same way without prior consultation : First , in the past year since the leader of the Taiwan authorities took office , he has not taken actual measures to relax and improve cross-strait relations and to dispel the people 's misgiving about his seeking " Taiwan independence " and this has caused the Taiwan society to have an unstable external environment .  
In recent years , in particular , the Western hostile forces have made use of the theories of human rights , globalization , and environmental protection , which are of common concern to the people , to pursue their strategy of westernization and disintegration behind a fashionable facade and under the pretence of the scientific nature of academic research , the objective nature of news reports , and the recreational nature of literary and art works and , for this reason , they are very confusing and deceptive .  
To this end , while making efforts to build the command , operation , and technical contingents and in connection with its efforts to tackle key scientific and technological problems in equipment development and training reform , it actively encouraged cadres having development potentials to attend academic symposiums and research results reviewing conferences sponsored by the superior organs , research units , and colleges and schools in an effort to broaden their vision and enable them to have unclogged access to information .

As may be seen from Chen Shuibian 's [ Ch'en Shui-pian ] inaugural speech on 20 May , this " minority leader " who took power with 39 percent of the popular vote is still hard-pressed to promote " Taiwan Independence " at present .  Under domestic and international pressure , he has forged compromises with all sides , and his government is presented with pretty wording and an academic wrapping .  However , all these are unable to conceal the consistently true nature of things .  
He added that apart from the gradual improvement in material conditions , a good academic research environment should include an institutional environment for scientific research , a humanistic environment , a good atmosphere for academic discussion , and harmonious interpersonal relationships .  
Science and technology in ancient China produced some stellar results , but there were some inadequacies , mainly in that no tradition of experimental science was formed and there was no system of academic disciplines .

Li Mingyu , a standing committee member , noted : the implementation of the strategy of ruling the country by law is demanding higher and higher standards for the quality of judges and procurators .  Placing stress on the academic requirements on judges and procurators , the current amendments have addressed just to the right issue , which suits the need for development of the legal system in our country .  
Some standing committee members stated that it is justified to set higher requirements on the academic qualifications of judges and procurators .  However , the quality of judges and procurators should not be reflected in their academic qualifications alone .  Examination only reveals professional standards , whereas other factors , such as political integrity and vocational ethics , can only be assessed by practical work .  
In this connection , Chang Shanna , a standing committee member , asserted : as far as the personal quality of judges and procurators is concerned , the key factor lies in their political integrity and ideological understanding .  So , in the revision of the two laws , stress should be laid on the academic requirements , and importance should be attached to the improvement of overall quality as well .

Right now , there are a total of 712 societies and organizations of all types .  They are divided into seven major categories including theoretical studies , social sciences , academic studies in science and technology , literature and arts , volunteer work , and sports and physical education .  
Although the United States calls ethnic Chinese a " model ethnic minority , " quite a number of whites still look down on ethnic Chinese in their heart of hearts .  Faced with the outstanding achievements of ethnic Chinese in the academic , science and technological , and industrial and commercial fields , they have suffered from a psychological unbalance , and the subconscious attitude of repressing and discriminating against ethnic Chinese has been waiting for the right time to break out .  
He emphasized in particular the need to strengthen the development of backbone cadres of professional and technical personnel , devote major efforts to train academic leaders and aces in the world frontiers of science and technology , train a large number of top-notch scientists , engineering and technical experts , scientific and technical management experts and other types of experts , and optimize the composition of our contingent of professional and technical personnel so that China can achieve a new leap in its science and technology , including national defense science and technology .  
Reportedly , the Chinese Government has attached importance to the development of human and social sciences .  " Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend , " encouraging academic exchanges with foreign countries , and intensifying research on international cooperation are the guiding principles for China 's efforts to develop and enliven human and social sciences .  
A cross-strait academic seminar on Dr . Sun Yat-sen was held here a few days ago .  Specialists and scholars from both sides of the strait pointed out that opposing a split and safeguarding national unification are important parts of Dr . Sun Yat-sen 's ideas and that reunification is the only choice of the Chinese on both sides of the strait .  
China 's well-known academic Liu Ji is in the opinion that economic globalization is the necessity of the development of large-scale socialized production , the inevitable course leading to world peace and universal harmony , and the economic base of the future new society of mankind .  
shall have cultivated organization and command capabilities as required by their posts ; shall have obtained relevant academic qualifications after receiving training in an academy or school ; and shall have remained in excellent health " ; and Section Four shall be revised as : " Shall cherish soldiers and set a good example with their own conduct ; shall remain fair and upright ; shall remain honest in performing official duties ; and shall work hard , live a plain life , and fear no sacrifices . "  
Since the US economy has grown strongly in recent years , its military strength far outstrips anyone else , and it controls international organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the World Bank , many in political and academic circles have become dizzy and declared that the US pursuit of world " unipolarization " is historically inevitable .  
and in guiding agricultural scientific and technological development , we should lay emphasis on enhancing the academic level of scientific research , pay more attention to orienting our work to the needs of the markets , and resolve the practical problems in agricultural development .  
The " Boao Forum for Asia " is an unofficial international conference organization .  Being based in Asia , it will provide a convenient place for people in the enterprise , industrial , business , and academic circles who are concerned about Asia 's development to obtain information , carry out exchanges , and strengthen cooperation , thus promoting mutual understanding and mutually beneficial cooperation between various Asian countries and between Asian countries and other regions of the world .  
In the coming academic year , the Institute will organise undergraduate and part-time taught postgraduate programmes to promote the continuing and professional development of teachers .  These programmes will certainly help to achieve our goal of raising the professional status of our teachers so as to meet the changing expectations of the community and to upgrade the overall quality of our education , " he added .  
The maximum grant is set at a level to cover tuition fees , academic expenses and compulsory student union fees .  Loans are intended to assist students in meeting their living and personal expenses .  
During visits to Frankfurt , Munich , The Hague and Amsterdam , the Financial Secretary held fruitful and frank discussions with a wide audience which included central bankers and leading bank chiefs , finance ministers and government officials , industrialists and business executives as well as several think-tanks and academic research groups .  
( b ) The Civil Service Bureau co-ordinates the assessment of non-local academic qualifications for civil service appointment purposes .  Assessment is conducted on a case-by-case basis for individual civil service job applicants to determine whether the non-local qualifications held by the applicants are comparable in standard to the local qualifications required for entry to the civil service posts concerned .  
In addition , the Government will establish an Applied Science and Technology Research Institute to provide " mid-stream " research , which is pivotal in linking basic scientific research to its commercial applications ; set up a $ 5 billion Innovation and Technology Fund to finance projects which will contribute to innovation and technological upgrading in the manufacturing and service industries ; establish a $ 5 billion Quality Education Fund for grants to raise school standards through innovation ; and facilitate technology collaboration between academic institutions and the business community .  
" As all applications are of a high quality , the selection panel , comprising members from heads and teachers of primary , secondary and special schools , an academic from a tertiary institution and ED officers had a difficult task in coming up with the allocation decisions , " he said .  
These panels are assisted by external reviewers who are renowned international academic / professional experts in the subject areas concerned .  
" We are very grateful that prominent members of the international academic community and respected members of the local professional and business community have agreed to participate as panel members in this important venture , " he added .  
The SCDS consulted the department management and staff before making its recommendations .  They considered that the pay advantage which the disciplined services now enjoy over the civilian grades in recognition of their special job factors should be preserved , but some adjustment would be justified to that element of the starting salaries of recruits entering the disciplined services which is based on academic qualification benchmarks in order to maintain broad comparability with the rest of the civil service .  
The HKCAA considered that the College had established a base from which it could develop into a degree-awarding institution .  It advised the College to enhance its academic standards further by formulating a long-term strategic plan , strengthening its quality assurance mechanism and fostering its links with its counterparts in the local academic community .  
The Fire Safety Committee , set up under the Buildings Department , comprising representatives from the Buildings Department and the Fire Services Department , professional and academic in the fire engineering field , has considered the findings and has agreed that the fire safety provisions in these Trident blocks constitute an acceptable fire engineering approach , which is recognised as one of the means under the Code of Practice for the Provision of Means of Escape in Case of Fire issued by the Buildings Department to meet the performance safety requirements of the Building ( Planning ) Regulations .  
" Nevertheless , Dr Lam said " over 70 per cent of the eligible academic staff in the UGC-funded institutions were able to produce some output that were of a quality which the panels considered worthwhile , and over 55 per cent ( including fractional counts ) have been assessed to have met the threshold standard of excellence appropriate to the discipline in Hong Kong , and showing some evidence of international excellence . "  
Although the overall success rate remained roughly at the same level as last year 's , Professor Young explained that the number of proposals considered by the Council to be of sufficient academic quality to merit funding support , but were unable to be supported by the Council because of a lack of funds , increased by about 34 per cent to 432 proposals .  
Under the programme , seminars will be organised for over 60 secondary schools within the current academic year .  The objective is to , through live demonstrations and simulate exercises , explain to the young generation the importance of information security , the technology of public key infrastructure , the use of digital certificates and the services provided under the Electronic Service Delivery Scheme .  
It is learnt that at present Mainland scholars have to go through some rather complicated and time-consuming procedure applying to the relevant Mainland authorities for coming to Hong Kong to conduct academic researches or give lectures , and some of such scholars were granted permission just a few days before their scheduled dates for lecturing , thereby causing much difficulty to the local organizations concerned in making arrangements .  
Its registration is based on HKCAA 's recommendations that CFHC had made conscious efforts to improve the academic environment for the provision of post-secondary education and that the four Higher Diploma programmes were of a satisfactory standard and comparable to similar courses offered at post secondary colleges and tertiary institutions in Hong Kong and overseas , " the spokesman added . 
On the academic , scientific research and athletic fronts , our achievements were no less impressive .  Last year , six Hong Kong scholars were awarded Membership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , with the youngest coming from Hong Kong . With the full support of the community and effective training , our sportsmen have won many medals in recent international competitions and in the 9th National Games last year .  
As part of an ongoing study to identify the way forward for improving water quality in Victoria Harbour , the Government is now seeking views from different sectors , particularly from academic institutions , green groups and professional bodies , on a set of proposed water quality criteria . 
( c ) of the average amount of public fund granted to each of these non-local students , together with the total amount of such funding , in the current academic year ; whether it knows which countries provide similar level of subsidies from public funds to foreign tertiary students ; and  
The Chairman of JUCC , Mr Graeme Large , said during the ceremony that the ongoing function of JUCC since its earliest days in 1970 was to support tertiary level students , faculties and researchers in their pursuit of education , learning and research by providing them with leading edge information and networking technologies to connect speedily and effectively not only within Hong Kong 's academic community , but with educational and research institutions worldwide .  
To tie in with the class resumption at primary and special schools , the Bureau will issue additional guidelines to remind schools of the various points to note , including arrangements for undertaking academic assessments and making up the lessons lost during class suspension .  Whole-day schools are advised to adopt a flexible timetable and consider adopting half-day schooling to spare students having lunch at school .  
Of the approved provision , $ 450 million would be made available for application by local researchers and research institutes from the public , private and academic sectors for projects covering research on etiology , surveillance and epidemiology of infectious diseases , public health , basic , clinical and health service research , and funding of institutions to enhance research infrastructure . 
Thus , subjects of academic , practical , vocational and integrated nature will be included in the curriculum to meet the different personal and vocational needs of students as well as the social , economic and technological demands of Hong Kong 's development .  
In the sixth area of education , health and sports , the two sides agreed to encourage the exchange of talent and experience in order to promote quality education and strengthen bilateral ties .  As regards the health sector , the two sides will enhance co-operation in the areas of academic exchange and Chinese medicinal products development , as well as encouraging Hong Kong investment in Shanghai 's medical institutions in the form of joint ventures .  As for sports , both sides would step up collaboration on the development of sports industries .  
The National Science Council , under the Executive Yuan , has established a " Scientific and Technological Information Center " in Taipei , to meet the needs of national economic construction and to serve better the industrial and academic worlds . The main tasks of the center include providing information service , collection of documents , coordination and communication and technological evaluation .  
Work Enriches Students ' Lives As a relative newcomer to the industrial world , Taiwan has been experiencing accompanying changes in its social and cultural structure . In China in the past , academic study was generally re served for the nobility or the rich , while toiling in the fields was the lot of most people .  
Many children of upper level cadres were admitted despite their low academic standards , while many outstanding students were rejected . Because my father had run a textile business before the Communists gained power , I was naturally considered part of the capitalist class .  
When young people dance they obtain satisfaction on the surface ; but the concealed subconscious motive may be a rebellious heart , " says Huang Wei-hsien , professor of Sociology at National Cheng-chi University . " The value judgments derived from the ideal of scholastic advancement cause those students with less than outstanding academic records to look elsewhere for support , rebelling against the superiority of society at large .  
Because this meeting is to be held in Peking , the government had to carefully weigh the valued ties to the organization and the possible reactions of the public and academic community against the policy of no official contacts with Peking . Lien explains that " official contacts " are not thinkable , but that it was easier to allow the delegates to attend in a private capacity . However , " it is hard to say " if this is a precedent .  
This so-called " domain of single subjectivity " refers to the main characteristic that in traditional Chinese history social , economic , academic , cultural , and artistic activities as subjectivities were deeply influenced by political activity as subjectivity .  
Our reliance upon foreign countries is still great . As the U . S . seeks royalties for its reading material , we can compete on a reasonable basis if we can increase the prices of these materials in order to benefit R . O . C . products . On the other hand , academic , educational , and technological material might be sold in larger quantities at lower prices .  
The government hopes that overseas experts and consultants can work together with domestic construction firms and academic institutions from the viewpoints of urban planning , financing , and urban management in exploring the comprehensive utilization of space in the area and in determining urban design control , development methods for public and private lands , development organizations , implementation schedules , and the like in order to promote the comprehensive development of the entire area .  
It is planned that by the 1993 academic year , the number of teachers per class will have risen to 1.5 , and this standard would be maintained until the turn of the century . As to class size , it is hoped that it can be reduced from the present average of 43 students per class to an average of 40 students per class by the year 1993 , with further reductions thereafter until the number will have been reduced to 35 students per class by the year 2000 .  
But the historical drama played out on this beautiful stage during the following century , in which the chief actors were the Chinese , the Dutch , the Spanish , and the Japanese , has nearly vanished into the mists of antiquity . Not only is the story little known among the general public , but the field is practically unexplored among academic researchers as well .  
According to a survey done twenty years ago , the University of Chicago ranked third among American colleges and universities , enjoying a lofty academic reputation and battling it out for number one as a worthy representative for the Midwest against Harvard on the east coast and Stanford in the west .  
Trade and business contacts , academic scholarly exchange , events sponsored by private groups , and overseas tourism by ordinary citizens are all channels for showing people overseas the good side of our people and for demonstrating the united effort being made inside and outside government . This is how a good international image is built up .  
Professor Ho Peng-yoke , a member of the Academia Sinica and present director of the Needham Research Institute , says that at that time there was great interest among scholars in traditional science and technology partly for reasons that were not strictly academic : China 's international position had declined drastically and she was backwards economically , technologically and militarily . In addition to this the condescension of Western and Japanese scholars stirred up an intellectual " war to defend culture , " which involved working hard to glorify the achievements of ancient Chinese science and technology .  
Especially after the end of the Second World War , which left the country , like the U . S . , relatively unscathed , its strong economy , which ranked among the world 's top , and its abundant capital at the time laid a good foundation for the development of its universities and academic research .  
He set up elementary schools in the island 's five towns and Kinmen senior high school , its highest academic institution . Next he led the troops in laying the island 's two main outer roads and its central highway . He also built a tobacco plant and a liquor distillery and encouraged farmers to plant sorghum , which they could sell to the distillery at high prices . Bottling and packaging for the liquor industry stimulated business at the ceramic plant and printing plant .  
As for the R . O . C . , which has deep ties with both Berkeley and Dr . Tien - - he graduated from Kien Kuo senior high school and National Taiwan University before going to the U . S . and Berkeley boasts more members of Academia Sinica than any other university overseas - - the Ministry of Education , the Legislative Yuan and the private sector have donated US $ 3 million since his appointment was announced in support of its research on East Asia and other broad academic areas . "  
Stalin , who massacred the intellectuals , paid special attention to genetics , psychology , applied mathematics and computers , which he saw as products of capitalism , and on the basis of pseudoscientific theories he ordered the schools to suspend any relevant teaching . " At that time a deadly atmosphere hung over academic circles , " says Karapetjants Artemi , a senior collaborator in Chinese languages .  
The ordinary teachers are also rigorously tested , attend lessons and write theses . Publishing articles in academic journals is compulsory work and under-taking research occupies at least half the workload . The topics of research are decided from above and there is no autonomy here . " Researchers in national defense have all been through a strict process of selection , " says V . Prudnikov .  
More than half the members of the current Diet are Waseda alumni , and the school has turned out four prime ministers , including Noboru Takeshita and Toshiki Kaifu . The Waseda " old school tie " network helps its own and wields tremendous clout . Besides featuring new academic concepts , the research center combines the latest art and technology in its architecture - - spacious , attractive buildings nestled in the hills . The big lecture halls , which can seat hundreds , are equipped with five or six television screens hooked up to the podium .  
As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "  
Many practical difficulties : If children are required to study additional subject matter which is not related to future examinations , then implementing local vernacular instruction in a situation where schoolchildren are already under heavy academic pressure is bound to provoke a reaction from many sides , including the children 's parents , the pupils themselves , the schools and certain sections of society .  
In colonized areas , the nostalgia felt by expatriates for their homeland reflected itself in a growing romanticism and meticulous concern for form , symbolism , and detailed embellishment in the external appearance of the buildings they constructed . This came to be known as the " Imperial " mode , a mode which became increasingly fashionable in European academic circles after the mid-19th century .  
If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious . The mass media is continually emphasizing that good academic work is not enough , and that a complete education should give equal emphasis to ethics , physical education , group consciousness , and fine arts as well . Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
Under the Japanese occupation , Taiwanese had limited access to higher education . Lien Wen-pin , now a famous doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , went to the temple to ask about his academic future shortly before he finished high school . The poem he drew read " You climbed the high mountain to study the immortals / But then came the imperial edict / When the white sun shines forever in a blue sky / If you so desire your fame will spread across the four seas . "  
The Ministry of Education , which has jurisdiction over sunken ships , argues that Huang has always been trying to get commissioned to do the work of recovering the artifacts . However , due to academic considerations , the Ministry can not sign a contract with a single individual . Thus plans for exploring and salvaging the ships have been delayed for eight years .  
Even if his academic record was n't anything special , he worked to help support his family . He was quick at making chicken cages , and early every morning would wash and shell the dried fava beans that his mother bought at the wholesale market and sold from her front door outside the military dependents ' village . "  
Second , because the members of these societies do n't have a high level of education , the clubs are very much a part of local Taiwanese culture - - virtual reflections of common Taiwanese society . " These poetry societies were not established in the modern academic era , and so they are representative of local temple fair society , " Chien says .  
But in the view of the institute 's director Chen San-ching , since Liu Shao-tang began the magazine thirty-odd years ago , although his work can not be said to follow the traditional methods of academic research , his contribution to Chinese contemporary history has been incomparable , for he has rescued countless quantities of first-hand material including manuscripts , photographs , documents and personal memoirs , and has inspired many people who then participated actively in research and writing .  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
Chienkuo High School , generally recognized as a " star school , " has already determined that its outstanding selected students will not be judged exclusively by the standard of academic grades . Particular emphasis will also be placed on performance in activity groups , in order to " lend balance " to their current student population , whose on-campus activities lean heavily in favor of scholastic pursuits .  
Other topics include " loving a younger man " - is it shameful for a female student to become involved with a boy who is her academic junior ? - and , how to define " best friends of the opposite sex ? " The true stories that emerge through these discussions touch on the personal concerns of the participants .  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
And how can we keep this concept-along with the familiar concept of IQ , and the newly-emerging one of children 's motor intelligence ( MQ ) - from being merely fashionable phrases which are mouthed parrot-fashion , and instead allow them to help us turn back from educational methods which have been twisted by an obsession with academic success , and give back to parents the opportunity to raise physically healthy and emotionally balanced children ?  
Society in Taiwan puts paramount im-portance on academic advancement . The call for a balanced education , in which ethical , intellectual , physical , social and artistic development are given equal stress , has long been regarded as a far-off ideal that gets lip service only .  
And before the old ailment could be cured , the patient contracted a new illness : pressures for academic advancement began growing heavier and heavier . The joint entrance exam system is a modern version of the imperial civil service examination system , and it pushes down on modern children so much they scarcely can breathe .  
Just as Emotional Intelligence author Daniel Goleman has observed , many social phenomena of the last few decades have revealed that neither academic achievement nor professional ability are the sole factors leading to success . Especially in modern corporations which emphasize organizational management , such qualities as emotional balance , personability and leadership are frequently more important .  
Because the theory of EQ includes a balanced , multifaceted educational perspective that emphasizes both the mental and physical aspects of individuals ' emotions , it has not only become popular among the population at large , but has also garnered considerable interest in the academic community , being seen as compatible with the call to educational reform .  
" Obsessively focusing on EQ , " he avers , " would very likely create an undesirable subculture in which people are hypocritical , excessively complex , and adjust their behavior according to each situation in order to curry the favor of others . If this happened , we might replace the past unfair bias toward academic standing and breeding , but we would be embracing a different kind of extreme . "  
Second , Lu Hsiu-lien offered strong personal credentials : a strong academic record , a clean and fresh image , a background as a leader in the women 's movement , and her imprisonment as an early democratic activist back in the early 1980s . She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
This academic debate not only revolved around objective evidence , but also involved national sentiments and encroached on the academic turf of various researchers . This has always been a highly sensitive area , so perhaps it is not surprising that for a while a fierce battle of words raged .  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
Out of the national scientific research budget of NT $ 40 billion at that time , NT $ 18.5 billion was earmarked for defense technology research ; of the remaining NT $ 21.7 billion , NT $ 7 billion was set aside for NSC-directed academic research , and the other NT $ 14-plus billion was distributed among the various subordinate departments of the NSC for applied technology research .  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
This exchange is the first time since the break-off of negotiations that dialogue has been conducted between the two sides . The letter sent from Taiwan on March 5th received a quick and clear response on March 11th with ARATS reiterating that they were willing to invite representatives from the SEF of " a suitable level " to lead economic , cultural or academic missions to the PRC , either to visit or participate in seminars . The opportunity to restart cross-straits negotiations can be traced back to earlier this year .  
People found the case even more startling not only because had it occurred in a staid seat of higher learning , but also because all those involved came from backgrounds which did not suggest criminality or licence : Hsu Chia-chen 's father is a civil servant , and her parents gave her a strict upbringing ; and Hung Hsiao-hui had always been a " good student , " with excellent grades since childhood and a smooth academic career .  
Tsai Yuan-pei had been living in France when he received a telegram from the Ministry of Education , hoping to entice him to come back to take the reins at Beida : " The nation is returning to normal , and urgently in need of education . Now we are making your virtuous self master of the capital 's highest academic institution . "  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
According to First International Computers ' Jeff Hsue , who has also traveled to the States himself to interview applicants , Taiwan 's ability to design and produce products is hard to beat . But he says that few Taiwanese firms are involved in taking product design to a higher level , whether it be through technological developments , preliminary research or even fundamental academic research , because of the difficulties and risks involved .  
When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired . " More class time is spent explaining English than teaching subject matter , " says Professor Chi Hsi-sheng of HKUST 's Division of Social Science .  
The year before last the show " Splendors of Imperial China " was well received by the American academic and cultural communities , and afterwards many nations extended invitations to the National Palace Museum . The French government worked especially hard to meet the Musuem 's needs , even passing a new law designating measures to protect foreign art works on exhibition there . Now , 63 years after part of the National Palace Museum collection first went to Europe for a show in London in 1935 , works from the museum are going to Paris .  
These periodicals and books are of a very high standard and have a respected position in international sinology . Their diverse content includes economics , literature ( both classical and modern ) , politics , history , philosophy and so on . These publications constitute a major textual resource for academic research .  
It is worthy of note that in recent years , German sinology has gradually turned away from " pure academic sinology " - research directed entirely at studying traditional China-and has incorporated such topics as modern politics , history , sociology , commerce , culture and education to examine practical issues in China . Hot topics of current research include such questions as the relationship between Confucianist thought and China 's modernization , and various aspects of Chinese philosophy .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
And in Meinung , a red banner draped in front of the Founding Uncle altar at the East Gate , presented by a local believer , reads : " Praying for sons , for wealth and for honors ; for academic success and for peaceful well-being . " Chang An-sheng , a local senior who sweeps the altar at 4 a.m . every morning , remarks : " Old Uncle here grants whatever you request . He 's especially effective with requests for examination success ! "  
It required " a grade one vocational qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a junior college of that time ] and a grade two academic qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a three-year technical high school of that time ] . Preparing for the test was difficult . Days were hard after you went to work too , both in the training period and when you actually were working . If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
When senior Macau officials are asked about having studied in Taiwan , they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in Macau , Lisbon , or mainland China . " It 's called sanitizing your record ! " quips Tan Zhiqiang , Hong Kong and Macau bureau chief for the China Times , who was born and raised in Macau and wrote his doctoral dissertation on " The Question of Macau 's Sovereignty . "  
According to art academic Chiang Hsun , Impressionism , from which sorrow and suffering and even seriousness all seem to be absent , was a product of the first generation to enjoy the fruits of urban life following the industrial revolution . The painter Renoir was particularly fond of showing nudes posed amid nature , depicted with caressing strokes of the brush .  
" When people think about students at star schools they think in terms of students who get good grades , but being a high academic achiever is not the same thing as being gifted , " says Cheng . At Kaohsiung High , which is the most selective school in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung testing zone , quite a few of the students find the textbooks hard to follow . They are so difficult and obscure because their editors designed them to meet the needs of a small group of truly gifted students .  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it . The tension between whites and blacks in America is very obvious , and my academic training gave me a way to analyze the situation and place it in its proper historical context . I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
The situation is somewhat different in Japan , a close neighbor of Taiwan and its former colonial master for half a century , which has a more complex emotional relationship with the island . The Japanese academic community has long paid close attention to non-literary aspects of the Taiwan experience , and it is against this background that Taiwan literature is now getting more attention .  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like . Environmental protection agencies are weak , and research funding is limited . Thus there is little concrete knowledge about the numbers of various species and whether these numbers are rising or falling , not to mention any understanding of what concrete steps can be taken to solve specific problems .  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
" There are still good students who select an agricultural college on account of the academic reputation of the university , " notes Hsu . " But with the abolition of the joint entrance examination next year , agricultural colleges are concerned that there 'll be a big drop in the quality of students they can attract . " With today 's changing circumstances , it is imperative for agricultural colleges to alter their approach . It 's both a crisis , and an opportunity .  
Since 1991 more than 100 new public and private high schools ( including comprehensive high schools ) have been founded , so now there are more than 270 such institutions . Meanwhile , the ratio of students entering academic vs . vocational tracks has been adjusted to 45:55 . This means that today more than 40% of kids can keep their university dream alive after junior high school .  
However , in contrast to the relative independence of European and American think tanks , in Taiwan , where political power has always held the upper hand over pure academic research , think tanks operate with such obvious political orientations that outsiders naturally assume that think tanks are nothing but parrots reflecting the views of the powers-that-be .  
In fact , Taiwan Advocates was established in response to President Chen 's idea of a trans-party " national security alliance , " bringing together many political figures as well as social and academic elites . Taiwan Advocates aims to be " the brains of the national security alliance , " and also to link together different political forces in the Legislative Yuan . Taiwan Advocates has held few public activities , so its actual impact remains to be seen .  
In addition , Taiwan 's background as a former Japanese colony and the many Taiwanese who have studied and worked in the US give the island a human network of international dimensions . Add in the fact that the island shares a common language and culture with China and with ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia , and the tight ties between its own business , political and academic circles , and Taiwan looks to be very well positioned here at the beginning of the era of globalization .  
As for Samson Tsou , with his incomparably rich academic and professional background and experience of international agricultural practice , he intends to move into teaching and research , and hopes also to be able to make a contribution to the development of international businesses in the field of vegetable farming , and thus achieve an ideal that is also in AVDRC 's future agenda .  
Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth . Ever since the Ming loyalist Koxinga ( Zheng Chenggong ) ruled over the island in the late 17th century , almost all Chinese-language scholarship on the subject has consisted of written tracts , with very few visual images . Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
To provide guidance for future legislation , I have begun collating a compendium of local and foreign academic writings , legislation and court rulings relevant to transgender rights . With regard to the protection of homosexuals ' rights , I recently published a monograph entitled On Equal Protection for Lesbians and Gay Men , which I hope interested readers will read for themselves .  
At present , 76 US medical schools offer courses in alternative medicine . In the international academic community , bioenergetic medicine organizations are holding frequent symposia , to take the first steps toward putting the field on a sound scientific footing . They have also begun active dialogue with practitioners of Chinese and Western medicine . It looks as if the health authorities in Taiwan ought not to completely ignore alternative medicine .  
Chang Chao-tang was born to a family of doctors in Panchiao , Taipei County . A smart kid , he was granted admission to Taipei 's prestigious Cheng Kung Senior High School based on his outstanding academic record alone , so that he did n't need to take the joint entrance exam .  
" Although the pattern in international medical aid is to offer long-term aid at fixed locations , the TRMPC will at least for the near future continue its approach of not adopting any fixed location , but of doing volunteer care deep in those areas that local medical systems do not reach , " says TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun . Like explorers on the Discovery Channel , the TRMPC 's tramping through the developing world has yielded some valuable academic discoveries .  
Before the 1980s , academic work on aborigines was largely confined to anthropology . Research focused on things like the clothing , social structure , and myths and legends of the various tribes . Aboriginal culture was treated as something already dead , as a museum specimen . This type of research was of no help at all in understanding how living indigenous people were responding to changing times .  
Chronologically speaking , each segment in the process was tightly linked . A MOE-certified candidate who completed teacher training in the summer of 1999 would then have to move on to the next phase of earning education credits at an academic institution by September ; 40 credits later , the prospective instructor would then have to locate an elementary school at which to complete the one year internship . Only strict adherence to this schedule would lead to a complete MOE endorsement - - a teacher 's certificate - - by September , 2001 .  
On September 13 , the Ministry of Education held the National Education Development Conference . At the conference , the central topic for higher education was " Promoting the Quality of Higher Education to Raise International Competitiveness . " The stated objective was to have a local university enter the ranks of the world 's top hundred universities within ten years , and have at least ten key academic departments or inter-institution research centers ranked first in Asia in their respective categories .  
Over time , with the constant expansion and division of academic disciplines , new units were established , including divisions of medicine , engineering , and agricultural science , as well as graduate institutes of tropical medicine , southern civilization , and southern resources . By the time Japanese rule ended in 1945 , the university had five academic divisions , a preparatory school , three graduate institutes , and 115 academic chairs , with 378 full-time academic personnel , 123 part-time personnel and 382 students .  
When NTU absorbed the Agricultural Division of TIU , it changed its name to the College of Agriculture ( CoA ) . With seven academic departments it was NTU 's largest college . Later , the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine was split into two , and the mechanical engineering group in the agricultural engineering department became a separate department . The CoA gradually expanded to 12 departments .  
I 've noticed a trend : in recent years , a large number of works that have entered the market have been from the mainland-both original Chinese and translated works-and this has become one of the causes of the current rapid expansion of the Taiwanese book market . Moreover , these books are n't limited to the old academic and translated works , they 've now grown to include popular literature .  
Asked what areas of personal concern they feel they most need to address , respondents answered , in order of priority : job skills or professional abilities and knowledge ( 30.1% ) ; personal economic or financial situation ( 21.5% ) ; foreign language ability ( 11.2% ) ; level of academic achievement ( 9.6% ) ; quality of life or place of residence ( 5.2% ) ; and religious or spiritual growth ( 2.6% ) .  
In his third year of senior high , in connection with the inauguration of the president of Costa Rica , Wu accepted an invitation to put on a personal exhibit in Central America , but he promised to go only after the school granted him leave . While he was preparing that same academic year for graduation and the equivalency exam , his father fell seriously ill and had to go into the hospital . While at the hospital caring for his father , Wu kept worrying about failing the equivalency exam .  
Such plans all emphasize lively and vivid presentation , and putting fun into learning . But the school authorities are also very aware that some parents might think the teachers are " not doing their regular work " or just playing games with the students . For this reason they must first persuade parents to support the approach . Fortunately , the experimental plan is aimed at first-grade students who entered junior high school in 2002 and who do n't yet feel the pressures of academic testing , so resistance is minimal .  
While continuing to work in the classical field , Lee also turned his attention to pop music . He could n't stand the schmaltzy love tales that characterized Mandarin pop lyrics , and he always found the music itself excessively influenced by Japanese teeny-bopper styles . Thus he took his background in academic music and plunged headfirst into the vulgar world of pop , determined to refine the genre and bring it to a higher level .  
The erudite Buddhist master Yin-Shun , said to be " the most eminent Buddhist since Xuan Zang , " celebrated his 100th birthday in late April , on the 20th day of the third lunar month . A huge conference was held jointly by Buddhist religious and academic communities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . It was a memorable event , as many Buddhist groups in Taiwan have been inspired by Yin-Shun 's teaching , and were in attendance to mark his birthday .  
A : The process was quite convoluted . In 1979 , we submitted an article to an American academic journal . The editor thought the findings violated scientific principles , as anyone with minimal knowledge of chemistry knew that molecules could not possibly exist in such combinations , and therefore rejected the paper . Perhaps to preserve academic objectivity , they sought the additional appraisal of an authority in the field , who also judged my assumptions to be too bold , casting doubt on the conclusions .  
In order to maintain this environment while also developing the level of the more academic courses we provide , we 've decided that the best choice is to follow the example set by overseas adult education providers and adopt a " twin-track " system .  
Teachers are also very concerned about the possibility of lowered academic competence on the part of their students , given the fact that the increasingly diversified subject matter of the new integrated curriculum takes away from time spent on basic subjects .  
Chou takes the nine-year integrated curriculum as an example . Neither the idea of a system integrating the content to be studied in Grades 1-9 , nor that of academic " fields , " are new . In fact , these things had been spelled out in previous curricular standards . In past decades , however , one saw the prevalent use of " contracting out " specialized tasks within Taiwan 's education system , so much so that now that things have been opened up , people can not imagine doing otherwise .  
At my children 's school , too , there are many truly dedicated teachers who put a lot of effort into running more flexible classes and communicating with parents , making them a part of their children 's education . These teachers have a four-pronged goal for their students : emotional development , life skills , personal growth , and fundamental academic knowledge . Their achievements show that if they work together , the trio of school , teacher , and parents can be a formidable one , and one which opens the door to truly excellent education .  
Chang specifically targeted seasoned pedagogues who were at or close to retirement age , reasoning that it would be the best way to attract true lovers of the teaching profession . Such individuals would be teaching primarily for the sheer pleasure of it rather than merely for profit . The teachers ' essentially altruistic persuasion along with their experience and dedication would combine to create an academic atmosphere high in quality but low in expense .  
wang , who is a deputy to the eighth national people 's congress , told xinhua the constitutional institutes have organized scholars , teachers and judicial workers to conduct study and academic exchange through various forms they have achieved valuable academic results and promoted development of chinese constitutional theory
