" In traditional Chinese thinking there were human rights , there just was n't the term for them , " says Chai Sung-lin , chairman of the Chinese Human Rights Association .

Grave concerns have been expressed that despite the worldwide call for an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba , this embargo not only continues but has been further strengthened and extended since the Helms-Burton Act was promulgated in March this year .

Our positive vote , based on the reasons I have just expressed , reflects Ecuador 's unwavering position of rejection and repudiation of the occupation or annexation of territory by force , as well as its firm conviction that a peaceful and negotiated settlement of territorial disputes between States must be reached without the threat of force , in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law .

While some support was expressed for the view that the current text ( in particular the words " exercise such powers . . . as the applicable foreign law may permit " ) adequately covered those instances , the prevailing view was that the text should express only the principle that the insolvency administrator is authorized to act in a foreign State without enumerating the types of measures or relief the administrator might be seeking .  
With regard to the requirement for a certified copy of the decision opening the foreign proceeding , the concern was expressed that the use of such an expression might exclude those cases in which the foreign representative was appointed , or the proceedings were commenced , without an actual decision or order of the court ( e.g . , by right pursuant to statutory authority , such as in a debtor-initiated voluntary proceeding ) .

We are hopeful that the coming consultations will overcome these obstacles and embody the political will expressed by the leaders of the world during the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as their affirmation that the expansion of the Security Council is a basic condition for making its membership more representative and its working methods more transparent .

I am firmly convinced that the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the leaders of the political party that won a clear majority in the 1990 elections and of other relevant political forces , including the national races and ethnic groups , is essential to achieve the Government 's stated objectives of democratization and national reconciliation and to assuage the concerns that have been repeatedly expressed in the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights about Myanmar .

Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 49 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
In an earlier report , JIU had expressed the view that it would be premature and even counterproductive to delegate essential functions before human resources management policies were formulated , all personnel procedures were reviewed and improved , proper demarcation of responsibilities in human resources management was established between OHRM and other offices and departments , and appropriate mechanisms for reporting and accountability were put in place .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern that the Trade and Development Report 's forecast of slow world economic growth reflected the effects of the unequal access of developing countries to external lending and FDI .

Recalling further section I.AA of its resolution 50 / 208 of 23 December 1995 , by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III .  A of its twenty-first annual report , [ 5 ] to take into account the views expressed by Member States at its fiftieth session , in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons ,  
His delegation , which fully associated itself with the views expressed at a previous meeting by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union , was of the view that the court , though closely linked to the United Nations , should be an independent international institution established by a multilateral treaty .

In its resolution 1996 / 71 , the Commission expressed very deep concern at information on rape and abuse of women in the areas of armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia , in particular in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and considered outrageous the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape used as a weapon of war which , in this context , constituted a war crime .  
Other delegations expressed the view that those organizational units should be merged with other relevant organizational units of the Secretariat or consolidated under the umbrella of a high-level official of the Secretariat to be responsible for the implementation of all action programmes on African development .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
Some delegations expressed their thanks to JIU for preparing an excellent study and described it as a high-quality analytical document , as well as a valuable and timely contribution to the current restructuring process in the economic , social and related fields of activity of the United Nations system .  
The view was expressed that paragraph ( 1 ) was inadequate to achieve the purpose for which it had been formulated , namely , to limit the possibility of opening local proceedings after recognition of a foreign main proceeding , since under paragraph ( 1 ) the mere presence of assets in a State would be sufficient for the opening of local proceedings .  
Having considered the different views expressed , the Commission agreed that paragraph ( 1 ) should be redrafted to provide that , upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding , the effects of a local proceeding in the enacting State should be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of that State and , to the extent necessary to implement coordination and cooperation under article 21 , to other assets of the debtor that , under the laws of that State , should be administered in such a proceeding .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .  
When we met during the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held only four months ago , we all expressed our deep concern that , compared to 1992 , the overall trend regarding sustainable development in developing countries is worse today .  
Considering the increased cooperation we have witnessed during the past year in support of Latin American and Caribbean Member States in the field of designing policies on social development including the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development on economic integration and on trends in the globalization process , our delegations are in favour of a further broadening and deepening of the mutual supporting activities between ECLAC and the Latin American Economic System , as expressed this morning by the representative of Peru .  
Only substantive consideration by the Council of the legitimate interests and concerns expressed by Member States during the debates can accurately guide the Council in its work and provide it with the necessary and impartial information that will enable it to assess the real causes of conflicts , counteract their consequences and take action to find just and lasting solutions , free from politically motivated prejudices and not dominated by the illegitimate interests of just one country or a small group of countries .  
Likewise , for democracy to have real meaning for it to be an ideal shared by all peoples and for it to fully achieve its liberating and saving effects it must be unambiguously expressed both at the national and the international levels .  
In our view , special attention should be paid in the charter to the security interests of States that have not joined military and political alliances and have not expressed the desire to join such alliances in the foreseeable future .  
A quick review of its recent report transmitted to the General Assembly indicates that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories expressed its grave concern at the existing human rights situation in the occupied territories as a result of the settlerist policy pursued by the current Israeli Government . 
And only a few days ago the Assembly extensively considered the question of Palestine and expressed its views in no uncertain terms on the Government of Israel 's continued evasion of the commitments and agreements reached as well as its blatant unilateral measures to impose a fait accompli in the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Mr . Thiebaud ( France ) ( interpretation from French ) : The General Assembly is being asked today to extend the mandate of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti ( MICIVIH ) to 31 December 1998 , in response to the wishes expressed by President Ren Pr � al in his letter dated 10 November 1997 to the Secretary-General , in which he requested the continued support of that Mission to carry out the institutional consolidation that is essential for a state of law and for the deepening of the democratic process in Haiti .  
They also expressed their concern that technological developments in the field of communication , including computer networks such as Internet , can potentially be used for the dissemination of racist , anti-Semitic and xenophobic propaganda , the main victims of which are , inter alia , racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities .  
In her special report on minorities ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 8 ) the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia expressed concern at the failure of the former Yugoslavia 's political leadership to meet the challenge of governing populations which do not share the nationality , ethnicity , religion or language of the different regions ' dominant national groups .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 48 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
Without genuine political will on the part of the international community , expressed in the form of cooperative arrangements , through , for example , the United Nations system and its various organizations , these most basic gaps will persist , seriously compromising efforts to move towards sustainable development .  
The Commission noted with interest that the democratic transition process in Equatorial Guinea had led to the holding of the first multi _ party legislative elections in 1993 , the first multi _ party municipal elections in 1995 and the first multi _ candidate presidential election in February 1996 ( para . 3 ) , although it expressed its deep concern at the fact that the presidential election had not guaranteed transparency and had not allowed the proper participation of all the political forces ( para .  4 ) .  
For example , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia both reported that several countries in their region expressed strong concerns regarding their problems in the implementation of and compliance with conventions due to the administrative burden imposed , and the lack of institutional and technical capacities and financial resources .  
I am sure that this desire is widely shared and also reflects the concerns expressed in the message with which the new Secretary-General of the United Nations honoured us in the wise and inspired words in which he noted that there is no institution on Earth better qualified to translate the universal yearning for peace into negotiated practical measures for enhancing international understanding and the security of all nations .  
In strict compliance with its mandate , the Mission verified and expressed its views on a case in which the death penalty was applied to two persons without need for the precautionary measures requested by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and , therefore , in violation of article 18 of the Constitution of Guatemala , which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty while legal remedies are pending . 
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
In view of the accelerated deterioration of the situation in Burundi and the current crisis afflicting the Great Lakes region , the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that , during the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , a special day should be devoted to considering all the problems confronting the subregion , culminating in the adoption of a joint resolution , in accordance with the wish expressed by the three Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Burundi , Rwanda and Zaire .

In various international forums , Panama has expressed its opposition to the growing tendency to seek to apply unilaterally with extraterritorial effect national laws and measures that affect other States in the field of trade and international relations , since they are contrary to international law , violate the principles of the legal equality of States , respect for and the dignity of national sovereignty , and non-intervention , and are detrimental to their harmonious coexistence .

Charg d'affaires a.i . The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries ( CPLP ) expresses its deep appreciation for the exemplary and democratic manner in which the people of East Timor exercised their right to choose their own future through the popular consultation that took place on 30 August 1999 , the results of which have unequivocally expressed the option of this brotherly people for national independence . 
In the current stage of global developments , there is still a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;

The Taliban 's conduct of forced displacement of the civilian population during their recent offensive in the Shomali plains is a particularly alarming signal which reflects the movement 's apparent disregard for the concerns expressed by the international community .

Widespread concern was expressed that an enhanced electronic signature would be considered as if it were a distinct legal concept , rather than just a description of a collection of technical criteria , the use of which made a method of signing particularly reliable .  
A view was expressed that the reference to article 7 of the Model Law in paragraph ( 2 ) of draft article 6 ( which was also useful as a reminder of the conceptual origin of the Uniform Rules ) was to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the Uniform Rules to situations where an electronic signature was used to meet a mandatory requirement of law that certain documents had to be signed for validity purposes .  
The view was expressed that , irrespective of whether draft article 6 established a presumption that the data was signed or a mere presumption that the electronic signature was technically reliable and linked to a given message , the burden of rebutting such presumptions might be too onerous in the context of consumer transactions , which might need to be excluded from the scope of draft article 6 .  
So it is that the objective of collective security of States , associated with the new horizons opened up at the end of the cold war and serious progress towards general and complete disarmament which should involve first and foremost weapons of mass destruction will be expressed in the new terms of physical well-being and quality of life for citizens .

On the question of the formulation of the provision , the view was expressed that , while the spirit of the proposal could be supported , an absolute formulation making the prior resort to peaceful settlement of disputes a sine qua non for the imposition of sanctions would be too inflexible in practice , as there may be occasions when sanctions would have to be resorted to immediately , and that it would go further than Article 40 of the Charter , which is formulated in permissive terms .  
The rejection of this hostile policy directed at Cuba was also expressed by the leaders of the non-aligned countries during their twelfth summit meeting , held in Durban in September 1998 ; Malaysia strongly supported the final document of that summit , wherein the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries reiterated their call upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial actions against Cuba .

Accordingly , it would appear timely to convene a meeting between government officials and representatives of the international community for the purpose of devising a common strategy for addressing not only the present , and very pressing , needs of the internally displaced for continued humanitarian assistance , but also their own expressed desire to become more self-reliant through increased access to opportunities for employment and other means of income-generation .

Those who finished high in the number of interpellations expressed satisfaction that their daily diligence at pursuing public policy is finally laid out for the public .

"

Maybe drawing large crowds with deliberately staged events is a necessary measure to develop the tourism industry . But what if they are " full of sound and fury , but lacking in soul " ( in the words of Wang Chen-hua , director of a private school ) .

The view was expressed that the accused should be allowed to enter a plea of guilty which would have the procedural effect of obviating the need for a lengthy and costly trial : the accused would be allowed to admit his wrongdoing and accept his sentence ; the victims and witnesses would be spared any additional suffering ; and the Court would be allowed to take the guilty plea into account in sentencing the convicted person .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .

A call for harmonization and uniformity was first expressed in Council resolution 1743 ( LIV ) of 4 May 1973 , in which the Council , mindful of the increase of unitization and containerization of cargoes as part of total world transportation , invited " international organizations concerned to foster the adoption of a single system of identification , classification and labelling of dangerous goods " and requested the Committee to continue to investigate divergencies currently existing in the modal practices in that respect .  
Despite the interest expressed in these projects , inter alia , by the countries where these peacekeeping missions are carried out , subsequent project proposals related to training needs of the civilian police of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) , the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNMIBH ) and the local police forces , including the establishment of a focal point for strengthening of criminal justice institutions , have so far received little support .  
In its resolution 50 / 58 K , the General Assembly expressed its concern , inter alia , that Burundi continued to face a social and political crisis , the adverse consequences of which were manifest in human rights abuses , the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and external trade and shrinking public revenue .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation also expressed the urgent need for the international community to call upon certain developed countries immediately to eliminate laws and regulations with adverse extra-territorial impacts and other forms of coercive economic measures against developing countries .

It is noteworthy that , while some Member States may have expressed reservations with respect to this or other provisions of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States on a variety of grounds , they have nonetheless expressed through the European Community 's statements and elsewhere their objection to the Helms-Burton legislation , so extreme and unjustified is its interference with their sovereign decision to maintain normal economic and commercial relations with Cuba .  
However , CPC had been unable to reach agreement on the content of that document at its session in June 1996 and had recommended that the Secretary-General be asked to present to the current session of the General Assembly , through CPC at its September session , a short and concise document to be considered for inclusion in the proposed medium-term plan based on relevant resolutions and decisions of intergovernmental bodies and taking into account the views expressed by the members of CPC .  
In its concluding observations on the report of Finland , the Committee expressed concern at the absence of an integrated monitoring mechanism capable , inter alia , of supervising the effectiveness of decentralized and sometimes privatized social ( health , education and social care ) municipal policies and services for the most vulnerable groups of society , including minority children .  
While some support was expressed for the view that the current text ( in particular the words " exercise such powers . . . as the applicable foreign law may permit " ) adequately covered those instances , the prevailing view was that the text should express only the principle that the insolvency administrator is authorized to act in a foreign State without enumerating the types of measures or relief the administrator might be seeking .  
With regard to the requirement for a certified copy of the decision opening the foreign proceeding , the concern was expressed that the use of such an expression might exclude those cases in which the foreign representative was appointed , or the proceedings were commenced , without an actual decision or order of the court ( e.g . , by right pursuant to statutory authority , such as in a debtor-initiated voluntary proceeding ) .  
At its fifty-second session , the Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 71 , of 23 April 1996 expressed its outrage that the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape had been used as a weapon of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina , recognized that rape in the context of armed conflict constituted a war crime and called for the protection and care of rape victims , respect for the special needs of victims of sexual violence in the investigation and prosecution of alleged violations and punishment of those responsible .

We are hopeful that the coming consultations will overcome these obstacles and embody the political will expressed by the leaders of the world during the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as their affirmation that the expansion of the Security Council is a basic condition for making its membership more representative and its working methods more transparent .

For all those reasons , and in view of its previous request for the strengthening of support to the Committee , made at its fourth session it expressed its willingness to be involved in future consultations with the Secretariat to ensure the optimal use of available resources and the effective performance of its functions , in the light of article 43 , paragraph 11 of the Convention .

Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
This singling out of the Jehovah 's Witnesses is almost certainly due to their religious militancy , which is expressed through proselytism , conscientious objection to military service and a variety of public demonstrations which call into question the interests of the dominant Church and the legislative and political system of the State .  
I am firmly convinced that the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the leaders of the political party that won a clear majority in the 1990 elections and of other relevant political forces , including the national races and ethnic groups , is essential to achieve the Government 's stated objectives of democratization and national reconciliation and to assuage the concerns that have been repeatedly expressed in the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights about Myanmar .

The Committee advised applicant States wishing to undertake energy-related exports to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for humanitarian purposes , that it was not in a position to approve the supply of energy-related products to the country for general distribution ; however , without prejudice to its final decision , the Committee expressed readiness to consider requests for authorization of shipments of strictly limited quantities of fuel targeting specific end-users among the most vulnerable groups of civilian population and for purely humanitarian purposes .

Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 49 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
In an earlier report , JIU had expressed the view that it would be premature and even counterproductive to delegate essential functions before human resources management policies were formulated , all personnel procedures were reviewed and improved , proper demarcation of responsibilities in human resources management was established between OHRM and other offices and departments , and appropriate mechanisms for reporting and accountability were put in place .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern that the Trade and Development Report 's forecast of slow world economic growth reflected the effects of the unequal access of developing countries to external lending and FDI .

BAKER ( Israel ) shared the view expressed by the Commission as to the difficulty of distinguishing between codification and progressive development of international law , especially in an era in which the development of international law took place in specialized spheres through the activities of various institutions , the regionalization of the handling of specific issues and an increase in law-making bodies , whether private or official , formal or informal .  
Recalling further section I.AA of its resolution 50 / 208 of 23 December 1995 , by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III .  A of its twenty-first annual report , [ 6 ] to take into account the views expressed by Member States at its fiftieth session , in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons ,  
Recalling further section I.AA of its resolution 50 / 208 of 23 December 1995 , by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III .  A of its twenty-first annual report , [ 5 ] to take into account the views expressed by Member States at its fiftieth session , in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons ,  
His delegation , which fully associated itself with the views expressed at a previous meeting by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union , was of the view that the court , though closely linked to the United Nations , should be an independent international institution established by a multilateral treaty .  
It further states that " the will of the people shall be the basis of authority of government " , and that " this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures " . 7 It also declares the right to equality before the law , to freedom of opinion and expression , and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association . 
8 December 1988 , reaffirming that the will of the people , expressed in periodic and genuine elections , shall be the basis of authority of government , the General Assembly stressed that , " as a matter of practical experience , the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country is a crucial factor in the effective enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights and fundamental freedoms , embracing political , economic , social , and cultural rights " . 
In its resolution 1996 / 71 , the Commission expressed very deep concern at information on rape and abuse of women in the areas of armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia , in particular in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and considered outrageous the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape used as a weapon of war which , in this context , constituted a war crime .  
Other delegations expressed the view that those organizational units should be merged with other relevant organizational units of the Secretariat or consolidated under the umbrella of a high-level official of the Secretariat to be responsible for the implementation of all action programmes on African development .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
Some delegations expressed their thanks to JIU for preparing an excellent study and described it as a high-quality analytical document , as well as a valuable and timely contribution to the current restructuring process in the economic , social and related fields of activity of the United Nations system .  
The view was expressed that paragraph ( 1 ) was inadequate to achieve the purpose for which it had been formulated , namely , to limit the possibility of opening local proceedings after recognition of a foreign main proceeding , since under paragraph ( 1 ) the mere presence of assets in a State would be sufficient for the opening of local proceedings .  
Having considered the different views expressed , the Commission agreed that paragraph ( 1 ) should be redrafted to provide that , upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding , the effects of a local proceeding in the enacting State should be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of that State and , to the extent necessary to implement coordination and cooperation under article 21 , to other assets of the debtor that , under the laws of that State , should be administered in such a proceeding .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .  
When we met during the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held only four months ago , we all expressed our deep concern that , compared to 1992 , the overall trend regarding sustainable development in developing countries is worse today .  
Considering the increased cooperation we have witnessed during the past year in support of Latin American and Caribbean Member States in the field of designing policies on social development including the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development on economic integration and on trends in the globalization process , our delegations are in favour of a further broadening and deepening of the mutual supporting activities between ECLAC and the Latin American Economic System , as expressed this morning by the representative of Peru .  
Only substantive consideration by the Council of the legitimate interests and concerns expressed by Member States during the debates can accurately guide the Council in its work and provide it with the necessary and impartial information that will enable it to assess the real causes of conflicts , counteract their consequences and take action to find just and lasting solutions , free from politically motivated prejudices and not dominated by the illegitimate interests of just one country or a small group of countries .  
Likewise , for democracy to have real meaning for it to be an ideal shared by all peoples and for it to fully achieve its liberating and saving effects it must be unambiguously expressed both at the national and the international levels .  
In our view , special attention should be paid in the charter to the security interests of States that have not joined military and political alliances and have not expressed the desire to join such alliances in the foreseeable future .  
A quick review of its recent report transmitted to the General Assembly indicates that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories expressed its grave concern at the existing human rights situation in the occupied territories as a result of the settlerist policy pursued by the current Israeli Government . 
And only a few days ago the Assembly extensively considered the question of Palestine and expressed its views in no uncertain terms on the Government of Israel 's continued evasion of the commitments and agreements reached as well as its blatant unilateral measures to impose a fait accompli in the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Mr . Thiebaud ( France ) ( interpretation from French ) : The General Assembly is being asked today to extend the mandate of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti ( MICIVIH ) to 31 December 1998 , in response to the wishes expressed by President Ren Pr � al in his letter dated 10 November 1997 to the Secretary-General , in which he requested the continued support of that Mission to carry out the institutional consolidation that is essential for a state of law and for the deepening of the democratic process in Haiti .  
They also expressed their concern that technological developments in the field of communication , including computer networks such as Internet , can potentially be used for the dissemination of racist , anti-Semitic and xenophobic propaganda , the main victims of which are , inter alia , racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities .  
In her special report on minorities ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 8 ) the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia expressed concern at the failure of the former Yugoslavia 's political leadership to meet the challenge of governing populations which do not share the nationality , ethnicity , religion or language of the different regions ' dominant national groups .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 48 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
Without genuine political will on the part of the international community , expressed in the form of cooperative arrangements , through , for example , the United Nations system and its various organizations , these most basic gaps will persist , seriously compromising efforts to move towards sustainable development .  
The Commission noted with interest that the democratic transition process in Equatorial Guinea had led to the holding of the first multi _ party legislative elections in 1993 , the first multi _ party municipal elections in 1995 and the first multi _ candidate presidential election in February 1996 ( para . 3 ) , although it expressed its deep concern at the fact that the presidential election had not guaranteed transparency and had not allowed the proper participation of all the political forces ( para .  4 ) .  
For example , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia both reported that several countries in their region expressed strong concerns regarding their problems in the implementation of and compliance with conventions due to the administrative burden imposed , and the lack of institutional and technical capacities and financial resources .  
I am sure that this desire is widely shared and also reflects the concerns expressed in the message with which the new Secretary-General of the United Nations honoured us in the wise and inspired words in which he noted that there is no institution on Earth better qualified to translate the universal yearning for peace into negotiated practical measures for enhancing international understanding and the security of all nations .  
In strict compliance with its mandate , the Mission verified and expressed its views on a case in which the death penalty was applied to two persons without need for the precautionary measures requested by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and , therefore , in violation of article 18 of the Constitution of Guatemala , which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty while legal remedies are pending . 
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
In view of the accelerated deterioration of the situation in Burundi and the current crisis afflicting the Great Lakes region , the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that , during the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , a special day should be devoted to considering all the problems confronting the subregion , culminating in the adoption of a joint resolution , in accordance with the wish expressed by the three Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Burundi , Rwanda and Zaire .  
Disturbed by the widespread occurrence in many parts of the world of violent conflicts engendering ethnic or religious hostility , and convinced that the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , together with other relevant instruments , is the best approach for resolving such conflicts peacefully , the Sub _ Commission in its resolution 1996 / 17 expressed its deep appreciation to the Working Group and called on the Commission to extend its mandate for another two years .  
However , the view was also expressed that , for those legal systems where the words " to intervene " were not well understood , those words might be given a different interpretation , and in particular that they might carry the meaning that the foreign representative might substitute for the debtor in judicial actions .  
While some support was expressed for modifying the article as suggested , one view was that the article should be deleted because it either stated what applied anyway or because it was not for a ( model ) national statute to deal with matters that concerned the hierarchy among legislative acts , an issue that had constitutional implications .  
A view was expressed that , as an alternative to the enumeration of the grounds on which recognition might be refused , the Model Provisions could contain a definition of the effects limited to coordination and cooperation , to be granted to the recognized foreign proceeding when a local proceeding is already pending in the enacting State .  
Educated women in the urban areas of northern Afghanistan expressed grave concern over the restrictive measures imposed on women by the Taliban movement , especially in large urban centres which had achieved a certain level of sophistication such as Kabul and Herat , where women have played a prominent role in the culture for centuries .

A number of members of the Committee expressed concern that in the current situation of dwindling financial resources throughout the United Nations system , there was a tendency in many organizations to cut the funding for public information activities , as public information work was difficult to define in quantitative terms .  
The Philippines - as expressed in previous comments - favoured the draft minimum rules and stated that the Department of Justice of the Philippines was developing several activities intended to improve the capabilities of prosecutors and enhance the working relations among law enforcers and trial court judges , in order to fulfil the desired goals set by the draft minimum rules .  
Costa Rica , true to the traditional principles of its foreign policy , has always expressed its firm and determined support for the peace process and , in the context of its deep feelings of friendship for and solidarity with all the peoples of that region , reiterates that peace , stability and reconciliation in the Middle East should be based on faithful compliance with the Oslo accords .

Alarmed by the marked increase in acts of sexual violence directed notably against women and children , as expressed in the Final Declaration of the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims , held in Geneva from 30 August to 1 September 1993 , and reiterating that such acts constitute grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,

The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
The view was expressed that reference to practical problems in the implementation of equitable access to the geostationary satellite orbit presupposed that there were no prior legal problems in the implementation of equitable access , particularly for the developing countries .  
At another level , the Non-Aligned Movement expressed its concern over the Afghan problem in the final communiqu of the ministerial meeting held at New Delhi earlier this month and expressed the need for the Afghan parties to move towards national reconciliation , in accordance with the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions .  
In view of the grave consequences of a possible intensification of military confrontation , the Polish delegation shares the view expressed by the Secretary-General in his report that it is necessary to increase and coordinate international efforts to impress upon the Afghan parties the need to solve the conflict in a peaceful way , that is to arrive at a lasting political settlement with the participation of all segments of Afghan society .  
The Sudan is also ready and willing to participate in the preparatory meetings leading to the forthcoming Ottawa Conference , which will hopefully commit those countries which have expressed their readiness to accept some constraints on the kind of landmine that can be used or sold , taking into consideration paragraphs 69 and 70 of the section on Disarmament and international security of the Final Document adopted at the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non _ Aligned Countries held in New Delhi on 7 and 8 April 1997 .

The Conference acknowledged the concerns expressed by several delegations that an insufficient number of national delegations from Latin America and the Caribbean had seen fit to attend the Sixth Conference and that some of the key decision makers and senior government officials had been absent from this important forum .  
Those delegations stressed the importance of disseminating information on the activities of the Organization throughout the world and the strategic role played by the Department of Public Information as information disseminator in order to enhance the image of the Organization and to promote an informed understanding of the work of the United Nations among the peoples of the world , through the implementation of mandated programme activities .  3 .

The Organization of African Unity has consistently expressed its concern over the continued sanctions imposed on that country , with their humanitarian consequences on the ordinary people , and has called for a fair trial of the suspects according to acceptable requirements of justice and international law .

He agreed with the view , expressed in paragraph 21 of the Advisory Committees first report ( A / 52 / 7 ) , that an economy that resulted in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service was a false economy and that the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget were realistic and reliable .

The outrage duly expressed by the international community , condemning the Taliban as the perpetrators of these killings , and particularly the special attention given to this tragic event by the United Nations as embodied in Security Council resolutions 1193 ( 1998 ) and 1214 ( 1998 ) laid the political , legal and international groundwork for the investigation of the issue , identification and prosecution of those responsible for the murders .

Widespread concern was expressed that an enhanced electronic signature would be considered as if it were a distinct legal concept , rather than just a description of a collection of technical criteria , the use of which made a method of signing particularly reliable .  
A view was expressed that the reference to article 7 of the Model Law in paragraph ( 2 ) of draft article 6 ( which was also useful as a reminder of the conceptual origin of the Uniform Rules ) was to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the Uniform Rules to situations where an electronic signature was used to meet a mandatory requirement of law that certain documents had to be signed for validity purposes .  
The view was expressed that , irrespective of whether draft article 6 established a presumption that the data was signed or a mere presumption that the electronic signature was technically reliable and linked to a given message , the burden of rebutting such presumptions might be too onerous in the context of consumer transactions , which might need to be excluded from the scope of draft article 6 .  
So it is that the objective of collective security of States , associated with the new horizons opened up at the end of the cold war and serious progress towards general and complete disarmament which should involve first and foremost weapons of mass destruction will be expressed in the new terms of physical well-being and quality of life for citizens .

On the question of the formulation of the provision , the view was expressed that , while the spirit of the proposal could be supported , an absolute formulation making the prior resort to peaceful settlement of disputes a sine qua non for the imposition of sanctions would be too inflexible in practice , as there may be occasions when sanctions would have to be resorted to immediately , and that it would go further than Article 40 of the Charter , which is formulated in permissive terms .  
The rejection of this hostile policy directed at Cuba was also expressed by the leaders of the non-aligned countries during their twelfth summit meeting , held in Durban in September 1998 ; Malaysia strongly supported the final document of that summit , wherein the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries reiterated their call upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial actions against Cuba .

Accordingly , it would appear timely to convene a meeting between government officials and representatives of the international community for the purpose of devising a common strategy for addressing not only the present , and very pressing , needs of the internally displaced for continued humanitarian assistance , but also their own expressed desire to become more self-reliant through increased access to opportunities for employment and other means of income-generation .

In the light of the discussions held previously on the initial proposal by Sierra Leone , a view was expressed cautioning against being overambitious and stating that the revised informal paper struck a manageable balance to build upon .  
In the Declaration , we also expressed our intention to carry out all the efforts required to ensure the Treatys full and universal implementation in order to promote the final objective , a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
However , the view was expressed that statutory language by itself was not sufficient to establish a functioning insolvency regime ; what was required was a strong institutional structure that was both accountable and transparent .

CARICOM member States have for many years expressed growing concern at the increasing threat to our marine environment posed by pollution and by the transportation of hazardous and nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea .

Other delegations expressed concern that dealing with possession was beyond the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee or that simple possession offences might not be treated as criminal offences ( as opposed to administrative or regulatory offences ) in domestic law .  
Several delegations expressed the view that , for such negotiations to be successful , developed countries must find the political will to overcome narrow domestic interests and deal with the concerns of developing countries in an equitable manner .

All States have an urgent obligation to complete negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , under strict and effective international control , as expressed by the International Court of Justice in its Advisory Opinion .

In the future , combating racial discrimination would be more difficult as it would be expressed less and less in crude forms of colour discrimination , but rather would be combined with class and other material conditions .

In contrast , the view was expressed that the distinction between primary and secondary rules was intellectually tempting , but rather artificial , hard to maintain , difficult to apply in practice and sometimes invalid .

All States participating in the negotiations expressed their determination to deny safe havens to those who engaged in transnational organized crime by prosecuting their crimes wherever they occurred and by cooperating at the international level .

Either by promoting weak decisions , watered down by the need to find a compromise acceptable to the permanent members , or by imposing immobility on the Security Council , the hidden veto can often be more negative than the expressed veto .  
The view was expressed that there is the need for developing countries to successfully manage the flows of foreign private capital at the national level in order to prevent financial distresses or crises while maximizing their benefits .

Those delegations expressed the view that such re-entry constituted a serious threat to human security and the economic activities of coastal States and threatened the marine environment and its natural resources .  
The view was expressed that , while discussing barriers to the greater use of space applications and services within the United Nations system under the second year of the work plan , in 2002 , difficulties experienced by the satellite data user community , such as the exorbitant cost of data , lack of technical know-how and of equipment to process the data and use the products thereof and inappropriate spatial resolution , should be considered in detail by the Subcommittee in order to find reasonable solutions to those problems .  
The view was expressed that the consideration of this regular item represented an innovation that had opened the door for an increased interest in the work of the Subcommittee of international organizations engaged in space activities and their active contribution to the progressive development of space law .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the brief historical summary on the consideration in the Legal Subcommittee of the question on the definition and delimitation of outer space , which the working group had requested the Secretariat to prepare , would be most useful for the continued discussions in 2002 , as it would assist in identifying positions that had developed over the years under the item and reduce the likelihood of a repetition of previous discussions .  
The view was expressed that a single issue / item for discussion should be included in the agenda of the forty-first session of Legal Subcommittee on international cooperation in limiting obtrusive commercial space advertising that could interfere with astronomical observations , as had been proposed by the delegation of the United States .

Israel recognizes , and has repeatedly expressed its sympathy for , the unfortunate deaths of Palestinian civilians and for the Palestinian populations that must endure the precautionary security measures foisted upon Israel by the inaction of the Palestinian leadership .

It expressed satisfaction at the progress made , and it affirmed its genuine desire to advance the GCC process in order to keep pace with ongoing changes at the regional and international levels so as to achieve the worthy aspirations and objectives set forth in the GCC Statute .  
It had expressed regret , however , that full information on the preliminary estimate of resources was not available in the proposed budget outline , despite the fact that in its resolution 53 / 206 , the General Assembly had requested that provisions should be made in the budget outline for expenditures for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved in the course of the biennium .  
It was also agreed that , in view of the concerns expressed about whether the draft convention should include private international law rules dealing with priority issues with respect to types of asset that were not receivables and about which the appropriate applicable law should be , and the issues identified for further refinement , the proposed text should be retained within square brackets .  
The concern was expressed that paragraph 2 was formulated in an overly broad way and might inadvertently result in giving priority even to consensual rights and even in cases in which the forum might not wish to apply its own rules and to give priority to preferential rights existing under its own law since no fundamental policy issue might be involved in a particular case .  
With respect to cases of honour killing considered by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers expressed his concern in regard to these instances of summary execution and urged the Governments concerned to bring those responsible to justice .  
With respect to the latter issue , he considered that making the Court subject to a prior decision of the Security Council would compromise its independence , a fact that justified the reservations expressed by numerous delegations which , like his own , considered it premature to ratify the Statute under those conditions and proposed that the Court should act on its own initiative to establish the existence of a crime of aggression in cases where the Security Council had refrained from doing so . 
Concern has been expressed that , where the summary of a 1503 communication is edited to eliminate material that may not deal expressly with the rights of women , this may distort the overall gist of the communication and may make it difficult to evaluate a governmental response that addresses all issues raised in the original communication .

The Ministerial Council welcomed the historic outcome of the referendum on the Charter of National Action in Bahrain , which expressed national cohesion as well as popular support for and mass approval of all the worthy measures and policies of His Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa , Amir of Bahrain , thus bolstering the process of modernization and development and the building of a bright future for the State of Bahrain and the advancement of its citizens .  
As far as we , the Palestinian people , are concerned , we believe that this failure also means a failure to contribute to ending the tragedy that has been taking place in the occupied Palestinian territories because of the bloody and oppressive campaign waged against our people by Israel the occupying Power and by the leaders in charge and the current and previous Israeli Prime Ministers Messrs . Sharon and Barak through all their declared and expressed statements and positions that run counter to international law and that call for escalation and confrontation .

The view was expressed that the initiative held considerable potential for facilitating the development of commercial activities in outer space , to the benefit of countries and in all economic spheres .  
The view was expressed that the interaction and potential conflicts between the proposed system of international interests in mobile equipment and existing domestic legal regimes would require careful analysis .  
The view was expressed that the proposal by the delegation of the United States regarding international cooperation in limiting obtrusive commercial space advertising concerned a matter of relatively little importance when considered alongside many of the other potential issues for consideration by the Legal Subcommittee .  
Requests the independent expert to clarify further the proposed development compact , taking into consideration views expressed during the two sessions of the Working Group and in broad consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations funds and programmes , as well as specialized agencies , relevant international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , those actors and States interested in developing pilot projects in this regard , keeping in mind :
