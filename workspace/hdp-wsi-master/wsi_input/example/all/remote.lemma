Designer Wang Huaiyi said that the research and development of a infrared remote sensor for space use is limited by the levels of a nation 's industrial , electronics , machining and other basic technologies .  If any one of these is unable to meet the demands of the project , the entire system will be impacted .  
During the process of monitoring and controlling the Beidou Navigation Testing Satellite , the center directly issued several thousand commands to the satellite and received correct responses from the satellite , which indicated that the satellite is operating normally and revealed that the exchange of information between the satellite and the ground station were unclogged .  All this fully reflects the superiority of the " central remote control " transparent work model .  
China is a vast country with a population of over 1.2 billion people , and broadcasting has close ties with the thinking , work and life of the masses .  The role of broadcasting can not be overlooked or replaced in the urban and rural areas , especially in the remote agricultural and pastoral areas .  Broadcasting has a great promise and a great future .  
Since Clinton , who had come from " a remote and backward place , " had limited knowledge and experience , and his aides and staff also lacked experience , he repeatedly made mistakes after he assumed office .  In less than two years , he lost nearly all his political capital .  In the mid-term election , the Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives overnight , thus rewriting US history .

When the market took off , he invited his friends out to celebrate , going to luxurious piano bars , and tossing around NT $ 1000 bills without a second glance . Unfortunately , the stock market later suffered repeated setbacks . Who knows where that NT $ 600,000 loan went ? All that 's left now is the monthly payment of principal and interest of six or seven thousand NT dollars , and the day when it will all be paid off seems to be in the very remote future . . . .  
When reading Ionesco or Wu we might rejoice that it is not the human race that is endangered , or feel happy that the inhumane phenomenon of forced prison labor is confined to remote China ; we should not forget that the loss of any species to this world , or any trampling on humanity is a serious threat and warning towards anyone who enjoys their human rights and art . (  
This group of new directors , called the fifth generation , includes such figures as Chen Kai-ge and Tian Zhuang-zhuang . They share some things in common . Because of the cultural revolution , they all lost the chance to study . Among those 20 million intellectual youths dispersed to the remote regions to live with the peasants , they know about these places ' odd customs .  
For remote areas where treatment is not easily accessible , the hospital 's Departtment of Family Medicine works with volunteers to organize a roving medical team , which goes deep into poor remote areas to deliver free care to the people .

But even though high-level medical technology ca n't be provided on location in these remote districts , where populations number in the hundreds , combined medical assistance should be sufficient , through telemedicine , mobile medical care , and public-sponsored rural physician visitation services , all of which have been carried out for many years , as well as the backup system of offshore military medical services .  
To be sure , for most unsophisticated and conservative women , the feminist theory that Awakening emphasized was a little too obscure and remote . It could do nothing to solve the urgent problems of abused or abandoned women . Fortunately , just about the same time as Awakening was getting on its feet , the first organization to provide support to help women through divorce - - first called " Lend a Hand " and later the " Warm Life Foundation for Women " - - was founded .  
Another example is monitoring of changes in forested areas . Keeping up with destructive exploitation or natural disasters ( like forest fires ) by using traditional survey techniques is time-consuming yet not timely , because of the huge extent and frequent inaccessibility of forested land ( which is often concentrated in remote mountain areas with no roads ) . Satellite surveys , on the other hand , cover huge areas and can be collected regularly , making them an invaluable tool .  
Later , so the story goes , when the Song dynasty gourmet and literary giant Su Dongpo was demoted and sent to serve as an official at Huanggang in Hubei Province , to satisfy his palate in that remote , impoverished place he used cheap local pork to make his own unique version of spice-stewed meat . His recipe was passed down and grew popular , and came to be known as Dongpo Meat ; it is considered one of his greatest " achievements in office . "  
When we sat resting on the limestone rocks , gazing down on the little winding path below the mountain and looking up to the blue sky and white clouds , I could n't help fantasizing big economic development schemes to help the people of these remote mountains , like manufacturing Lian Mountain mineral water , bottling fresh Lian Mountain air , building a heliport , or developing a tourist business .  
Chinese have long understood how to listen to the natural music of the soughing pines . This is especially so for those ancient literati who learned that it was their duty to serve their nation , but who could find no ruler who would listen to their criticisms of official corruption and inefficiency . Disappointed by the mundane world , these literati found in pines a salve , admiring how , even in the most remote places , they grew strong .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
Another example is a set of pictures taken on 22 April 1979 , when President Chiang went with the then Taiwan provincial governor Lin Yang-kang and others on a tour of the remote and mountainous Wuchieh area of Nantou County . Chiang has just finished eating , and is enjoying the beautiful scenery of the mountains of central Taiwan . He is obviously in high spirits . Wearing a jacket with just a T-shirt inside , he calls out " Come on , come on !  
When humans in remote antiquity thought about their own origins , and then went on to ponder the origins of the vast universe , they explained it in terms of magical forces , and in the process created large numbers of heavenly and earthly spirits . The sense which humans have always had of being mere visitors in this dusty world , along with their harsh struggle for existence , caused them to believe in , and later to seek and to fashion , a better world .  
Although in the minds of the ancients fairylands were extensions of the real world , the more distant and unattainable they were , the more scope they left for the imagination . The island of Penglai was hazy and indistinct , and the mountains of Kunlun vague and remote .  
The satellite project began in June 1994 , when the ROC commissioned the US firm TRW to build ROCSAT-1 . The ROC then selected 28 technicians to go to the US to observe the design and construction . The ROC also requested that TRW transfer the technology necessary to build some of the components . Local firms such as Acer , TranSystems Inc . and Shihlin Electronics then became involved , building the satellite 's onboard computer , its remote interface unit and its solar power panels , respectively .  
Moreover , in cities , interpersonal relations are often fluid and remote , and an untraditional woman is not likely to meet as much outside pressure . However , on the margins of the city or in the countryside , because interpersonal relations are so close , the conservativeness of couples , in-laws , neighbors , and colleagues creates a dense net . There will be tremendous resistance to any change in a marital relationship . Women in rural areas need to resolve these issues .  
In many of the more remote mountain districts , the population drain has led to Earth Lords being consolidated together for joint worship , while in major industrial areas , and sites where large development projects are in progress , numerous Earth Lords , suddenly deprived of their own hideaways , now have to cram together at a single altar .  
Take for example nasopharyngeal cancer , to which Chinese are specially susceptible . Nasopharyngeal cancer originates near the base of the skull , close to vital organs , so there 's little room for safety to make surgery more practicable . In addition , nasopharyngeal cancer is extremely likely to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or other more remote areas of the body , so it is difficult to get all of the cancer with surgery .  
Whether they are forced to travel to this distant country by a life of poverty at home , or they have come to roam remote lands , hearts brimming with ambition for the future , all foreign laborers that come to work in Taiwan dream of returning with a purse filled up with gold .

Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs . It 's not just anyone who is cut out for this pursuit , for frogs are especially active at night , when most people are in dreamland . He explores dark forests , deep valleys , and remote watercourses , searching for the 31 species of frogs and toads in Taiwan . He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
For Cegaw , winning an award for something so close to his heart and home is " something I 'll never forget as long as I live . " In fact , though members of the tribe were enthusiastic about participating in the competition , even Cegaw thought that many other sites were better , and that the chances of a prize were remote . Residents were astonished by the news that the site was named as one of the 100 to get through the preliminary round .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
Composed of doctors and medical students from Yangming University , this group campaigns across Taiwan , north and south , against their declared enemy : chronic illnesses in remote or poor locations that lack the resources to cope . For the last two decades , this battalion of doctors has criss-crossed Taiwan 's 21 counties and cities , and even served in Kinmen . Having started out with a simple mission to conduct pap smears , they now target chronic illnesses and do preventive community medicine , leaving ineradicable traces of their passing .  
That very night he departed from the world without a warning or farewell . His passage was free and easy , but those whom he left behind were reluctant to let go . Liu 's biographer Yang Meng-yu once asked Liu whether he worried about not being able to wrap up loose ends should something befall him during one of his romps through some remote corner of the world .  
Wu Hsiao-ming , a doctoral candidate in international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai , assumed when he entered in 1997 that it would n't be long before direct travel would be possible between the two sides . Five years have passed and the prospect of direct travel is still remote . Many students likewise thought that the government would recognize mainland degrees by the time they finished their programs , and that everything would be smooth sailing thereafter , but this idea has proved far removed from reality .  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
Perhaps because Yushan is located in the most remote part of Taiwan 's mountainous regions , and access is difficult , it has largely escaped deforestation , with the exception of the cypress forests of the Nantsaihsien River , which were completely logged out , and outlying areas such as Tungpu and Tataka . The core areas in the center of the national park still boast virgin forests and a vibrant ecology .  
These days , Taiwan 's last remaining ink maker is something of an urban recluse , his shop tucked away in a remote corner of the city . For nearly half a century , he has borne the stifling heat and complex manufacturing process , determined to produce block after block of quality hand-made ink . But it has n't always been this way . The industry had its day in the sun in the 1970s , when the economy was booming and the study of calligraphy compulsory .  
In remote , rural areas , the programme was usually limited to the basic essential information , such as the meaning of the " red " and the " blue " ballots , and practice voting .

Designer Wang Huaiyi said that the research and development of a infrared remote sensor for space use is limited by the levels of a nation 's industrial , electronics , machining and other basic technologies .  If any one of these is unable to meet the demands of the project , the entire system will be impacted .  
During the process of monitoring and controlling the Beidou Navigation Testing Satellite , the center directly issued several thousand commands to the satellite and received correct responses from the satellite , which indicated that the satellite is operating normally and revealed that the exchange of information between the satellite and the ground station were unclogged .  All this fully reflects the superiority of the " central remote control " transparent work model .  
China is a vast country with a population of over 1.2 billion people , and broadcasting has close ties with the thinking , work and life of the masses .  The role of broadcasting can not be overlooked or replaced in the urban and rural areas , especially in the remote agricultural and pastoral areas .  Broadcasting has a great promise and a great future .  
Since Clinton , who had come from " a remote and backward place , " had limited knowledge and experience , and his aides and staff also lacked experience , he repeatedly made mistakes after he assumed office .  In less than two years , he lost nearly all his political capital .  In the mid-term election , the Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives overnight , thus rewriting US history .

When the market took off , he invited his friends out to celebrate , going to luxurious piano bars , and tossing around NT $ 1000 bills without a second glance . Unfortunately , the stock market later suffered repeated setbacks . Who knows where that NT $ 600,000 loan went ? All that 's left now is the monthly payment of principal and interest of six or seven thousand NT dollars , and the day when it will all be paid off seems to be in the very remote future . . . .  
When reading Ionesco or Wu we might rejoice that it is not the human race that is endangered , or feel happy that the inhumane phenomenon of forced prison labor is confined to remote China ; we should not forget that the loss of any species to this world , or any trampling on humanity is a serious threat and warning towards anyone who enjoys their human rights and art . (  
This group of new directors , called the fifth generation , includes such figures as Chen Kai-ge and Tian Zhuang-zhuang . They share some things in common . Because of the cultural revolution , they all lost the chance to study . Among those 20 million intellectual youths dispersed to the remote regions to live with the peasants , they know about these places ' odd customs .  
For remote areas where treatment is not easily accessible , the hospital 's Departtment of Family Medicine works with volunteers to organize a roving medical team , which goes deep into poor remote areas to deliver free care to the people . Dr . Lai Yu-chia has just completed a half-year stint on the roving volunteer team .  
Adapted from a story in Lin Yu-tang 's Chinese Legends , The Arch is set in a remote village in southwest China , where a 34-year-old widow lives , dutifully supporting her mother-in-law and raising her only daughter - - as workers build a traditional arch attesting to the widow 's faithful and self-sacrificing behavior .  
But even though high-level medical technology ca n't be provided on location in these remote districts , where populations number in the hundreds , combined medical assistance should be sufficient , through telemedicine , mobile medical care , and public-sponsored rural physician visitation services , all of which have been carried out for many years , as well as the backup system of offshore military medical services .  
To be sure , for most unsophisticated and conservative women , the feminist theory that Awakening emphasized was a little too obscure and remote . It could do nothing to solve the urgent problems of abused or abandoned women . Fortunately , just about the same time as Awakening was getting on its feet , the first organization to provide support to help women through divorce - - first called " Lend a Hand " and later the " Warm Life Foundation for Women " - - was founded .  
Another example is monitoring of changes in forested areas . Keeping up with destructive exploitation or natural disasters ( like forest fires ) by using traditional survey techniques is time-consuming yet not timely , because of the huge extent and frequent inaccessibility of forested land ( which is often concentrated in remote mountain areas with no roads ) . Satellite surveys , on the other hand , cover huge areas and can be collected regularly , making them an invaluable tool .  
Later , so the story goes , when the Song dynasty gourmet and literary giant Su Dongpo was demoted and sent to serve as an official at Huanggang in Hubei Province , to satisfy his palate in that remote , impoverished place he used cheap local pork to make his own unique version of spice-stewed meat . His recipe was passed down and grew popular , and came to be known as Dongpo Meat ; it is considered one of his greatest " achievements in office . "  
When we sat resting on the limestone rocks , gazing down on the little winding path below the mountain and looking up to the blue sky and white clouds , I could n't help fantasizing big economic development schemes to help the people of these remote mountains , like manufacturing Lian Mountain mineral water , bottling fresh Lian Mountain air , building a heliport , or developing a tourist business .  
Chinese have long understood how to listen to the natural music of the soughing pines . This is especially so for those ancient literati who learned that it was their duty to serve their nation , but who could find no ruler who would listen to their criticisms of official corruption and inefficiency . Disappointed by the mundane world , these literati found in pines a salve , admiring how , even in the most remote places , they grew strong .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
Another example is a set of pictures taken on 22 April 1979 , when President Chiang went with the then Taiwan provincial governor Lin Yang-kang and others on a tour of the remote and mountainous Wuchieh area of Nantou County . Chiang has just finished eating , and is enjoying the beautiful scenery of the mountains of central Taiwan . He is obviously in high spirits . Wearing a jacket with just a T-shirt inside , he calls out " Come on , come on !  
When humans in remote antiquity thought about their own origins , and then went on to ponder the origins of the vast universe , they explained it in terms of magical forces , and in the process created large numbers of heavenly and earthly spirits . The sense which humans have always had of being mere visitors in this dusty world , along with their harsh struggle for existence , caused them to believe in , and later to seek and to fashion , a better world .  
Although in the minds of the ancients fairylands were extensions of the real world , the more distant and unattainable they were , the more scope they left for the imagination . The island of Penglai was hazy and indistinct , and the mountains of Kunlun vague and remote .  
The satellite project began in June 1994 , when the ROC commissioned the US firm TRW to build ROCSAT-1 . The ROC then selected 28 technicians to go to the US to observe the design and construction . The ROC also requested that TRW transfer the technology necessary to build some of the components . Local firms such as Acer , TranSystems Inc . and Shihlin Electronics then became involved , building the satellite 's onboard computer , its remote interface unit and its solar power panels , respectively .  
Moreover , in cities , interpersonal relations are often fluid and remote , and an untraditional woman is not likely to meet as much outside pressure . However , on the margins of the city or in the countryside , because interpersonal relations are so close , the conservativeness of couples , in-laws , neighbors , and colleagues creates a dense net . There will be tremendous resistance to any change in a marital relationship . Women in rural areas need to resolve these issues .  
In many of the more remote mountain districts , the population drain has led to Earth Lords being consolidated together for joint worship , while in major industrial areas , and sites where large development projects are in progress , numerous Earth Lords , suddenly deprived of their own hideaways , now have to cram together at a single altar .  
Take for example nasopharyngeal cancer , to which Chinese are specially susceptible . Nasopharyngeal cancer originates near the base of the skull , close to vital organs , so there 's little room for safety to make surgery more practicable . In addition , nasopharyngeal cancer is extremely likely to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or other more remote areas of the body , so it is difficult to get all of the cancer with surgery .  
Whether they are forced to travel to this distant country by a life of poverty at home , or they have come to roam remote lands , hearts brimming with ambition for the future , all foreign laborers that come to work in Taiwan dream of returning with a purse filled up with gold .

Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs . It 's not just anyone who is cut out for this pursuit , for frogs are especially active at night , when most people are in dreamland . He explores dark forests , deep valleys , and remote watercourses , searching for the 31 species of frogs and toads in Taiwan . He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
For Cegaw , winning an award for something so close to his heart and home is " something I 'll never forget as long as I live . " In fact , though members of the tribe were enthusiastic about participating in the competition , even Cegaw thought that many other sites were better , and that the chances of a prize were remote . Residents were astonished by the news that the site was named as one of the 100 to get through the preliminary round .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
Composed of doctors and medical students from Yangming University , this group campaigns across Taiwan , north and south , against their declared enemy : chronic illnesses in remote or poor locations that lack the resources to cope . For the last two decades , this battalion of doctors has criss-crossed Taiwan 's 21 counties and cities , and even served in Kinmen . Having started out with a simple mission to conduct pap smears , they now target chronic illnesses and do preventive community medicine , leaving ineradicable traces of their passing .  
That very night he departed from the world without a warning or farewell . His passage was free and easy , but those whom he left behind were reluctant to let go . Liu 's biographer Yang Meng-yu once asked Liu whether he worried about not being able to wrap up loose ends should something befall him during one of his romps through some remote corner of the world .  
Wu Hsiao-ming , a doctoral candidate in international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai , assumed when he entered in 1997 that it would n't be long before direct travel would be possible between the two sides . Five years have passed and the prospect of direct travel is still remote . Many students likewise thought that the government would recognize mainland degrees by the time they finished their programs , and that everything would be smooth sailing thereafter , but this idea has proved far removed from reality .  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
Perhaps because Yushan is located in the most remote part of Taiwan 's mountainous regions , and access is difficult , it has largely escaped deforestation , with the exception of the cypress forests of the Nantsaihsien River , which were completely logged out , and outlying areas such as Tungpu and Tataka . The core areas in the center of the national park still boast virgin forests and a vibrant ecology .  
These days , Taiwan 's last remaining ink maker is something of an urban recluse , his shop tucked away in a remote corner of the city . For nearly half a century , he has borne the stifling heat and complex manufacturing process , determined to produce block after block of quality hand-made ink . But it has n't always been this way . The industry had its day in the sun in the 1970s , when the economy was booming and the study of calligraphy compulsory .  
In remote , rural areas , the programme was usually limited to the basic essential information , such as the meaning of the " red " and the " blue " ballots , and practice voting .

Since it could be argued that , with better visual information , the health impact perhaps would have been less significant , a major recommendation derived from the first experiment was that , in future experiments , technological solutions had to be sought that might bring the physical environment of remote interpretation as close as possible to normal on-site conditions .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 54 / 248 of 23 December 1999 , decided that , in the absence of an Assembly decision to the contrary , the use of remote interpretation should not constitute an alternative to the current institutionalized system of interpretation , and that the use of remote interpretation should not affect the quality of interpretation or in itself lead to any further reductions in language posts , nor should it affect the equal treatment of the six official languages .  
On the other hand , a high degree of consistency at the personal level is evident : individuals who have a more positive view of the quality of the visual and sound information available to them also feel less burdened by remote working conditions , and vice versa .  
After the second experiment , it is evident that , so long as maintaining an acceptable level of quality of service in a new working mode requires additional physical and psychological effort , typical individual workloads expected during on-site work would need to be reduced if remote interpretation were to be used . 
For example , reference may be made to losses attributable [ to the wrongful act ] as a proximate cause , [ 168 ] or to damage which is too indirect , remote and uncertain to be appraised , [ 169 ] or to any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations as a result of the wrongful act .
