Article 44 Those that violate articles 25 , 26 , and article 27 , clause 1 , items 2 and 4 should be given a warning by the industrial and commercial administration organs and other relevant administrative law enforcement organs .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
This reporter has learned of the following information from the National Anti-Pornography Office : All localities in China have stepped up the crackdown on illegal publications , applying the law in harshly punishing the criminals involved in illegal publication cases .  Since the second half of 1999 , local judicial organs have again tried a number of important cases , imposed sentences on the perpetrators , and struck a powerful blow at and deterred criminals .  
The main responsible official and directly responsible official of a unit which has used fiscal funds , raised money , or imposed levies for the building or expansion of any commemorative facility in violation of the rules shall be dealt with sternly in accordance with the relevant provisions of party and government discipline .  
The restriction on projects on which restriction must be imposed can also be appropriately relaxed so long as such projects are conducive to the development of the western region and do not affect local environmental protection or the overall situation of national economic construction .  
The General Department of Politics proposed the education 's objective , composed of four aspects , including " strengthening ideals and convictions , putting into full play exemplary models , improving the atmosphere of the grassroots units and fortifying the role of Party organizations " .  This objective embodies the fundamental requirements of the " three represents " imposed on the Party 's basic-level organizations and its members throughout the military .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
It is understood that " sewage charges " are charged according to the monthly water consumption of enterprises ( including foreign-invested enterprises and units ) and different rates are imposed on industrial enterprises , tertiary enterprises and public institutions .  " Sewage charges " on enterprises that have not yet met environmental protection standards are several times higher than for enterprises that are up to standard .  
However , we maintain that the United States should assume moral responsibility .  So the United States should be the first to take the next step , show as much goodwill as it possibly can , and make diplomatic mediation in a sustained manner .  If the United States confines itself , exerts verbal pressure , and even hints that trade sanctions may possibly be imposed and that several punitive measures may be applied with regard to the arms sales to Taiwan , no benefit will be brought to the current stalemate .  
As expected , soon after the editorial was published , Tsai Ing-wen announced on 16 April to the outside world : " The report submitted by the Mainland Affairs Council to the Executive Yuan on the issue of revising the policy of ' no haste , restraint ' will have to revised with the factor of economic changes taken into account . "  " Only after completing a thorough analysis of the risks involved will the government start lifting restrictions imposed by ' no haste , be patient ' . "  
3 .  The mainland failed to coordinate .  Due to the differences of views between its central and local authorities and between its different local authorities , it lacked unified policies for approving and issuing entry certificates to the people of our side .  It also deferred in eliminating the obstacles of laws to its commodity imports and exports and imposed strict restrictions on its people 's visits to Kinmen and Matsu , thus limiting the implementation of the three mini links .  
In addition , some stress cooperation among the cities in the course of economic globalization in an attempt to " get rid of constraints imposed by states " .  Such a view is as a matter of fact an attempt to break down the existing legal system in various countries , which runs counter to the interests of developing countries and is not conducive to improving habitat conditions in those countries .  
The vigorous development of the CPC 's international liaison work was of great significance in new China 's efforts to break through the political isolation and economic blockade imposed by the Western countries , and in consolidating its newfound political power .  At that time , it also impacted on the peace and national liberation movements throughout the world .  
The responsible official at the foreign trade division of MOFTEC concluded that all the aforementioned facts showed that the temporary protective measures the Japanese side imposed against the three Chinese farm products severely ran counter to WTO rules in terms of its procedure and its substantial content .  
It may also bring us some possible and unpredictable difficulties and risks .  This new situation has imposed a new and even higher demand on the standards of Party and government leading bodies and cadres at and above the county level , particularly their ideological and political standards and their ability to handle complicated situation and solve actual problems .  
Article 28 .  The persons who have obstructed and hindered pipeline enterprises from conducting normal check-up rounds , maintenance , and rash repairs of pipeline and auxiliary facilities in violation of the stipulations of these regulations shall be ordered to correct their errors by designated departments under local people 's governments at and above the county level ; besides , a fine of no more than 2,000 yuan can be imposed on an individual , while a fine of no more than 50,000 yuan , on a unit .  
At home , Junichiro Koizumi has never experienced the same hardships endured by the broad masses of laboring people .  While studying abroad , Junichiro Koizumi never bothered to learn about , either , the miseries suffered by the people of neighboring Asian countries when the Japanese militarists invaded their countries and imposed colonial rule .  
However , as far as its essence is concerned , only the pattern of integration of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , which gives expression to the basic connotation of the integration pattern , can in a fundamental way do away with the restrictions imposed by " departments and regions , " thoroughly break down the pattern in which logistics support to the three armed forces is provided separately , and really effect a leap from the joint rear service support to integrated logistics support for the three armed forces .  
Gao Dezhan said : It is necessary to work intensively to formulate laws for protecting peasants ' rights and interests in connection with the ongoing rural taxation and fee-collection reforms ; and according to the laws , stop the irregular practice of some local governments and departments in collecting fees , imposing fines , and raising funds among peasants in various forms and names .  Thus , the peasant 's legitimate rights and interests can be protected by the legal means , and the burdens imposed on them can be reduced .

Standing committee member Feng Henggao emphasized that the draft amendments should set forth express provisions against judicial corruption , so as to eliminate any bias out of favoritism and monetary consideration .  He suggested that more measures should be adopted to strengthen supervision of judges and procurators by the people 's congress , the mass media , and the public , and heavier punishment should be imposed on any law enforcement personnel that violate laws , so as to prevent and reduce judicial corruption .  
Regrettably , out of political considerations , a number of developed country shareholders willfully trampled on the World Bank charter , imposed conditions on the relevant recommendation report prepared by the World Bank administrative authorities , and raised unreasonable demands in another attempt to obstruct the project 's implementation .  
In the last three years , Shanghai 's textile industry has imposed the mandatory reduction of 863,000 units of cotton and textile spindles and equipment installed in the 1970 ' s or earlier , thus increasing the share of more advanced equipment from 30.6 percent to 61.1 percent and creating the material condition for transforming the elite of the textile industry into a " metropolitan industry . "  
The " 10th Five-Year " plan has imposed further demands on reform of the SOEs , as they must accomplish a strategic readjustment of their position in the national economy .  There are things they should engage in , and things they should n't .  Namely , they should pull out of those competitive areas which are not suited to SOE development , while those SOEs which it is necessary to retain should achieve the diversification of entities investing in them through the form of joint-stock companies , establishing a modern enterprise system and improving their economic management .  
In addition , the government has imposed mandatory reductions on some industries with excess production capacity ( such as the textiles , iron and steel , and coal-mining industries ) and limited their output .  Enterprises that used backward technology or caused heavy pollution were ordered to close .  In response to market competition , moreover , some enterprises have closed their doors , gone out of business , suspended operations , or scaled back production .  
Chen Guangfu , responsible person of the interdepartmental joint meeting on reducing enterprise burdens held by the State Council , urged that prior to 30 June this year , all collection of charges , fines , funds , and fund raising related to township enterprises that are not in line with stipulations must be comprehensively abolished .  Those that are above the prescribed standards must be rechecked .  Duplicated collection of charges must be merged together , and all apportionment imposed on township enterprises must be resolutely stopped .  
After the implementation of these reform measures , there was for the most part a significant " clearing of the corruption " in a short period of time , so farmers had the opportunity to relax and generate profits .  But in the end , because of the restrictions imposed by the social and political environment at that time , the opposite result was the outcome , with the base for future taxes actually increasing , and the farmers ' burden was heavier .  
Earlier , in 1995 , former US President Clinton announced that economic sanctions would be imposed against Iran , thereby restricting all trade and investment with companies in the US and abroad .  Iran 's supposed hampering of the Middle East peace process , support of international terrorism , and a probe into weapons of mass destruction were the pretext for the decision .  
The Chinese people have never recognised the unequal treaties imposed on them , never forgotten for a single day the humiliating state of Hong Kong under occupation and never stopped their indomitable struggle for state sovereignty and national emancipation .  
" Having given careful consideration to the facts of this case , and to the established legal principles , the Secretary for Justice decided that the sentences imposed are authorised by law , and can not be said to be wrong in principle or manifestly inadequate , " he said .  
It is learnt that Hongkong Telecom was in breach of the provisions of its licence some time ago by offering discounts to its IDD call customers without the prior authorisation of the Telecommunications Authority .

( a ) of the respective numbers of complaints received by the Administration in the past 2 years against food suppliers about their unlicensed operation , undesirable hygiene conditions in their food factories or unsanitary food supplied by them ; of the number of cases in which these suppliers were prosecuted ; and the average penalty imposed for each successful prosecution ;  
The Housing Authority has relaxed a restriction on public rental flat allocation in the Urban District to allow selected applicants on the Waiting List ( WL ) to take up vacant flats in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island . The Authority 's Rental Housing Committee ( RHC ) approved today ( Thursday ) to relax the restriction rule imposed in 1990 debarring WL applicants registered after 13 December 1990 from opting for the Urban District , with the exception of Elderly Persons Priority Scheme ( EPS ) .  
Contrary to what some have alleged , there has been no unfair targetting of certain demonstrators by the police ; there has been no arbitrary or improper use of the discretion to prosecute ; no heavy penalties have been imposed on demonstrators ; and there is no evidence whatsoever that the current law unfairly restricts the right to peaceful assembly .  
For cases which can not be established by these procedures , neuropathological examination of the brain through autopsy would be conducted to establish the diagnosis . ( d ) The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department ( FEHD ) , in line with recommendations of the relevant international authorities , including Office International des Epizooties and World Health Organization , has imposed additional sanitary requirements on beef products imported from European Union countries which have reported cases of mad cow disease to prevent and control the spread of the disease in Hong Kong . 
However , the RHC agreed that second priority green form status will be given to non-property-owning households who fail the CMT with income and asset limits set at HSP and SRA levels but opt to purchase Home Ownership Scheme ( HOS ) flats or take other subsidised housing opportunities .  Applicants who fail the CMT pitched at WL levels will still be subject to the eligibility criteria imposed on white form applicants .  
Given the history of China over the past 200 years , when wars were imposed by foreign countries on her , wars were fought and lost , when territories were ceded , when war reparations needed to be made , when people 's dignity was lost and the country was driven to extreme poverty , Chinese people of successive generations including those of today yearn strongly for peace , stability and prosperity , for the restoration of dignity and international standing and for the preservation of territorial integrity . 
Magistrate Lo Pui Yin pointed out that the defendant had substantive control over the complainant such as when and how the beautician worked , what services were to be provided by the beautician and the obligations imposed on the beautician to observe the detailed staff rules .  Besides , @ noting that a regular monthly basic salary was paid to the beautician , the court ruled that the beautician was an employee of the defendant .  
At the legislative level , sites and structures with outstanding historical and architectural / archaeological values are declared as monuments , and stringent statutory restrictions imposed to prohibit demolition and limit alteration .  
We will introduce legislative amendments in the middle of this year to require installation of particulate traps and catalytic converters on all pre-Euro light diesel vehicles .  The same statutory requirements will be imposed on all pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles upon completion of the current programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting of catalytic converters next year .  
Because the Japanese military imposed strict order , any photography that included topographic features , military bases , or indeed any photo whose field of vision extended downward more than 45 degrees had to be approved by the military police . Thus it was difficult for ordinary people to photograph freely outdoors .  
Teach fishermen restraintAlthough Taiwan 's tiny community of marine scholars has already been worn thin studying ocean-dwelling mammals , NTOU , the only institution engaged in shark research , put forth a five-year plan for basic research in this area . Their goal is to understand the local shark catch situation and provide data for reference if controls are imposed in the future .  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
Old hunting grounds have been claimed by the state , with every tree and blade of grass strictly protected . With heavy punishments imposed from above , and the attraction of external economic opportunities , the social status of hunters has dropped precipitously , from an honored class to a virtually criminal class .  
Such questions are ignored , as are the intangible emotional aspects of morality , such as self-esteem , self-respect , caring for others , and even a sense of shame , a sense of guilt , moral courage and so on . Thus morality can easily become superficial or even a complete sham , adopted for show but not practiced in reality . In other words , under these circumstances moral actions never advance beyond the stage of " heteronomous morality " [ imposed by outside authority ] , and are unlikely to come from the heart .  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , with over 170 member states , places wild animals into one of four categories depending upon the size of their surviving populations and how endangered the species may be . Various controls and limitations on import , export , and trade are then imposed for the various categories . Protected animals may only be imported under certain conditions , such as for educational purposes or medical treatment , but not for profit .  
In 1988 , Hungary relaxed its immigration laws and concluded a bilateral visa exemption treaty with the PRC . In one fell swoop , thousands of Chinese people poured into Hungary . In a few years , their numbers increased more than tenfold , and when the Hungarian authorities realized that the situation was getting out of hand , they quickly imposed restrictions .  
Mr . Joudeh informed the Special Committee how he had lost his entire crop and stopped farming as a result of the prolonged curfews imposed in the occupied territories after the Gulf War :  
The system of apartheid sought to dehumanize entire peoples and imposed on the region of southern Africa a brutal war which has resulted in untold loss of life , destruction of property and massive displacement of innocent people .  
Deeply preoccupied by the increasingly heavy burden being imposed , particularly upon developing countries with limited resources of their own and upon the international community as a whole , by these sudden mass exoduses and displacements of population ,  
The point is that , in such cases , there should be a minimum level of safeguards , through the application of a set of agreed , uniform rules and procedures , in order for the imposing and lifting of sanctions to take place in a manner that strikes a balance between , on the one hand , the interests of the international community and , on the other , the extent of the human suffering endured by peoples on whom the sanctions are imposed .  
Our people find it astonishing that in an era of such developed mass communication , which leaves no distance between different corners of the globe , the apparently insurmountable difficulties in particular , the actual causes of the continuing imposed war are not understood .  
Unless the Organization effectively demonstrates its ability to guarantee the international legal order over and above " international policies " dominated by the most powerful nations , under which economic and trade embargoes are imposed and the principles of non-intervention are violated , the international system will without doubt soon be in its painful and prolonged death throes .  
This is the case of the economic , commercial and financial blockade that for more than 34 years has been imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba , in violation of the most fundamental norms of international law , of peaceful coexistence among sovereign and independent nations , and of freedom of trade and navigation .  
In this regard , despite extensive damage caused by the imposed war and other economic pressures , the Islamic Republic of Iran , endowed with the resolve and work ethic of its entire population , has been able not only to move towards reversing the vast destruction of the war , but also successfully to complete its first five-year economic and social development plan and embark upon the implementation of the second five-year plan on solid foundations .  
This statement of intent has changed nothing : the reality of the situation is that the sanctions imposed on Iraq have been continued as a means of collectively punishing an entire people , and the steps required from Iraq to end the sanctions have remained as vague as they have always been in the Council 's resolutions , as in paragraph 21 of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , for instance .  
However , factors of history and constraints imposed by the external economic environment in particular , reduced official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , worsening terms of trade and increased barriers hindering access to markets in the developed countries have prevented any fundamental improvement in their economic situation .  
Those Governments that are thus accused of failure to live up to international humanitarian standards are subjected to unilateral arms embargoes imposed on them by the arms - exporting countries , whereas the perpetrators of violence who procure their weapons , perhaps from the very same sources , are never held accountable for their illegal and destabilizing activities .  
These figures may demonstrate the extent to which the lives of innocent civilians in Iraq are at risk over and above the threats posed to them by the shortage of food and medicine and the adverse health situation owing to the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq and by the Iraqi people 's lack of access to the most elementary and basic humanitarian needs .  
On this issue , it is important that we be clear about the goals of the sanctions imposed , the need for a timely agreement on precise conditions and machinery for lifting them once they have fulfilled their purpose , the inadmissibility of tightening sanctions if that would hinder the process of a political settlement , and the vital need to consider humanitarian factors .  
The United States has been alarmed and disconcerted by the political stability enjoyed by the Libyan people , by the fact that it rallies to its leadership and by its steadfast character despite the iniquitous economic embargo imposed as a result of the hegemony of certain major Powers in the Security Council , chiefly the United States of America itself .  
Another representative pointed out that the idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law as regards the constituent elements of crimes and the penalties to be imposed was worth considering , although the manner in which that was effected would require careful study .  
The loss of life , the destruction of property , the disruption of the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians living in the western Beqaa and South Lebanon now seriously aggravated by the interdiction imposed by the Israeli naval blockade on thousands of fishermen to carry on their only gainful activity , are all acts of blatant Israeli defiance of the precepts of international law and Security Council resolutions 425 ( 1978 ) , 426 ( 1978 ) and 509 ( 1982 ) .  
The duty imposed on the Prosecutor in paragraph 1 raised once again the difficulties involved in reconciling the respective responsibilities of the international criminal court and those of national authorities .  
We , Yugoslav physicians and other health workers , call upon all the progressive forces of mankind , and particularly cultural and humanitarian organizations , to raise their voices , guided by principles of humanism , ethics and democracy , against the perils of international sanctions imposed on the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and call for putting an end to that unique concentration camp in the world of today .  
In addition , ongoing technological innovations over the years have imposed an extraordinary burden on the mechanical and electrical support systems , which are now operating at full capacity , making them inadequate and inefficient and resulting in higher energy consumption and increased utility costs .  
In its letter to the President of the General Assembly and in subsequent oral and written representations to the Committee on Contributions , Iraq stated its view and stressed that its inability to pay resulted from the comprehensive embargo imposed by Security Council resolutions , which had deprived Iraq of its financial resources .  
The failures of the international community in providing protection to the people of Bosnia , in halting policies of ethnic cleansing , as constituting a war crime and a crime against humanity , and in ending the deliberate obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian assistance mean that we must reconsider the maintenance of the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia with a view to enabling its people to exercise its legitimate right to self-defence .  
They continued to suffer the effects of an unfavourable economic environment characterized by the ongoing deterioration in the terms of trade , their staggering external debt burden and currency devaluations imposed under structural adjustment programmes , and aggravated by the negative impact of the agreements resulting from multilateral trade negotiations .  
The negative economic impact on the target State depends on a variety of factors , such as the magnitude and scope of the imposed coercive economic measures , the relative size of the target vis - - vis the sender State ( i.e . , the degree of economic autonomy of the target State ) , and the availability of alternative economic options for the target State in terms of access to markets , capital , technology and investments .  
Major pharmaceutical firms and suppliers of medical equipment and medical equipment spare parts , which had historically maintained trade links with Cuba , recently informed the Cuban authorities officially that since their products either contained United States components or were manufactured under United States technological licences which were affected by the ban imposed by the United States federal authorities , it was impossible to proceed with the deliveries .  
In line with its support for General Assembly resolution 49 / 9 , the Islamic Republic of Iran rejects the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba and considers it a violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , lacking acceptable justification in current international affairs .  
The complete embargo which has been imposed on the people of Iraq for the last five years , depriving the Iraqi people , including women , children and elderly , of their most basic legitimate right , which is the right to life , is not considered as a violation of human rights , since it was the wish of the forces hostile to Iraq , with which Mr . van der Stoel is cooperating .  
That situation is epitomized by the unjust comprehensive embargo that has been imposed on Iraq for almost five years , leaving an inhumane impact on various aspects of life and producing social conditions alien to our society , which adheres to high moral values and is distinct in its security and stability . 
The resolution encompasses dubious political objectives such as deceiving world public opinion in order to eliminate the growing pressure to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and lift the unjust embargo imposed on it in a bid to divert efforts to that end within the Security Council and thus ensuring the continued imposition of the embargo for as long as possible .

The legitimate world-wide concern for social development and environmental protection should not be allowed to degenerate into additional conditionalities imposed on developing countries from abroad .  
Although the Turkish Cypriots now live free from Greek Cypriot harassment , oppression and terror , an inhuman embargo on their political , economic , social and cultural activity , imposed by the other side , continues .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Bulgaria 's space programme had suffered in recent years from the effects of the painful transition from a centrally planned to a free market economy , and the severe economic crisis ; its national economy had also suffered from the strict implementation of sanctions imposed by the Security Council on other countries .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
In that connection , he reiterated that the increase in Iraq 's rate was unjustified since it ignored the country 's economic situation and the adverse consequences of the complete embargo imposed on it by the Security Council , since that embargo had deprived it of any source of income and rendered it unable to respond to the humanitarian and vital needs of the population .  
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , for its part , had paid its assessed contribution up to the end of the current year , despite the difficult economic circumstances it was suffering ; those difficulties , as everyone knew , had been considerably worsened by the consequences of the embargo and unjust sanctions imposed by the Security Council .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
It is already clear today that the conflict imposed on the Tajik people an enormous human tragedy was aimed at undermining the newly emerging foundations of the State and interfering with economic growth and market reforms and hence the country 's independent development along a general democratic course .  
However , that is not because , apart from current financial constraints , the Organization has not allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping operations ; it is because it has not come to grips with the real causes of conflicts , and because artificial solutions have so often been imposed which , far from fostering a negotiated and objective settlement of conflicts , have been dictated by hegemonic interests . 
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
Mwakawago ( United Republic of Tanzania ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegation 's appreciation for the Secretary-General 's report , contained in document A / 51 / 355 dated 13 September 1996 , concerning agenda item 27 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
Seemingly intractable , age-old problems have witnessed dramatic developments , stability and economic development .  As my Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated , the Government of Angola is profoundly concerned by the difficult social and economic situation prevailing in the Republic of Cuba as a result of the financial and economic blockade imposed on that member of the General Assembly .  
Secondly , I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to remind the international community that my country is suffering from an inhuman , illegal and unjust economic blockade imposed by the neighbouring States under a pretext involving my country 's domestic policies a question that has already become nugatory .  
Therefore , any action taken by Israel since the beginning of the Madrid process to alter the political , legal or demographic status of Jerusalem is tantamount to creating a fait accompli to be imposed on the Arab party , which would constitute a judgement on the status of the Holy City before the beginning of the final status negotiations .  This is unacceptable and can not be conducive to the peace we all desire .  
As many United Nations agencies had stated , the impact of the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq was not limited to the frightening number of deaths which it had caused among children , women and the elderly , since in fact an entire generation of Iraqis had been sacrificed as a result of the difficulties they had encountered in terms of education and health and other social spheres .  
With regard to the assets freeze imposed under resolution 883 ( 1993 ) , at its 43rd meeting , on 4 May 1994 , the Committee authorized the Chairman to convey to all States and international organizations its decision by which it stated that the transfer of funds through Libyan blocked accounts for legitimate diplomatic missions and international organizations in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , was , as an exception , permissible in terms of resolution 883 ( 1993 ) .  
While it was true that the current system of 12 hours of meetings daily required overtime payments for the servicing of evening and night meetings , the expenditure thus incurred would remain within the budgetary limits authorized for the period in question because of the restrictions which had been imposed earlier in the session .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
We are addressing ourselves to you , Mr . Secretary-General , in the difficult and critical circumstances in which we find ourselves , in order to assure you once again that we reject and condemn the policy of blockade and closure being pursued by the Government of Israel and to convey to you our extreme displeasure and great concern at the dire consequences the blockade measures are having and at the ongoing closures that have been imposed by Israel on the entire Palestinian people in the areas subject to the Palestinian National Authority . 
The legislation regulating the use of cash exceeding 20-million liras ensured the identification of bank and financial brokers , and imposed upon them the obligation to inform the Questore of all suspicious transactions , without incurring penal and administrative sanctions because their collaboration exonerated them from criminal liability .  
Spanish legislation laid down very useful additional measures for cases in which the offences were committed by organized gangs , as well as increasing the penalty imposed , such as the dissolution of the organization , closure of its premises , temporary suspension of its activities and professional disqualification of its members .  
Such a method of operation may be characterized by widespread use of bribery and favours to ensure the malleability of key positions and agencies ; political funding to ensure that politicians elected to office will be indebted to the criminal organizations ; carefully targeted " payoffs " to law enforcement personnel to provide intelligence ; and the provision of financial incentives to members of the judiciary to ensure that the penalties for criminal activities are either not imposed or are modest .  
The growth of lending was now inhibited by a limited profitability of investment ; the reluctance of banks to take long-term commitments because of risks imposed by uncertainty over future political and economic conditions ; the inability to obtain clear titles to real estate needed for collateral ; and lack of use of chattel mortgages by banks in financing vehicles and equipment .  
As for the alleged emigration of Turkish Cypriots from Northern Cyprus , this is both an exaggeration and the epitome of hypocrisy on the part of the Greek Cypriot side , because the economic and other hardships being faced by the people of Northern Cyprus are the direct result of the inhuman economic , social , cultural and political embargo being imposed on our people by the usurper Greek Cypriot regime in Southern Cyprus .  
I have the honour to inform you that under Article 35 , paragraph 1 , of the Charter of the United Nations , the Government of Burundi has decided to propose the convening of an urgent meeting of the Security Council to discuss the total and illegal economic blockade , which is in all respects contrary to international law , imposed by the States of the Great Lakes Region and the threat of an imminent arms embargo to the very severe detriment of our country and our people .  
Although no substantive intergovernmental or inter-agency discussion on the subject has yet taken place , the recent conceptual analyses and specific case studies have featured several basic principles or criteria for identifying and assessing the special economic problems of States arising from the implementation by them of sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter .  
I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention also to the question of the two no-flight zones which the United States of America and the United Kingdom have imposed on Iraq and which the Iraqi Government has on numerous occasions said are the result of a unilateral act based on the continued use of armed force for the purpose of attacking Iraq 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
On 2 November 1995 , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 10 , entitled " Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba " , in which it requested the Secretary-General , in consultation with the appropriate organs and agencies of the United Nations system , to prepare a report on the implementation of the resolution in the light of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to submit it to the Assembly at its fifty-first session .

By a note verbale dated 30 August 1996 ( A / 51 / 330-S / 1996 / 721 and Corr . 1 ) , the representative of Bulgaria transmitted to the Secretary-General a national communication on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 50 / 58 E , in which it is pointed out , inter alia , that , by virtue of its geographic location and the outward nature of its economy , Bulgaria has been extremely vulnerable to the negative side effects of the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
The Committee considered that the mandate received from the General Assembly did not require an opinion on bilateral issues between member States , which is why it makes no statement on the specific measures adopted by the Government of the United States of America in relation to Cuba , such as the embargo imposed for over three decades , while nevertheless noting that such measures raise legal questions in the light of the norms established in articles 18 and 19 of the charter of the Organization of American States ;

This unprecedented formula of a coordinated , inter-institutional , international cooperative effort to assist States in their observance of mandatory economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council may have been a decisive factor in making these measures a valuable and effective policy instrument in the graduated response to threats to international peace and security in this case .  
The documents also detail the advantages of the Saddam river project in the marsh area , and explain the reasons for the imposition of some of the severe punitive measures of a preventive and temporary nature dictated by the difficult conditions experienced by Iraq as a result of the economic sanctions imposed on it .  
With regard to the proceedings of the National Convention , the main criticisms which have been variously made have centred around , first , the composition of the delegates and the absence of genuine and proper representation of members returned at the general elections ; second , the restrictions imposed upon the delegates and the restrictive procedures which are required to be followed ; and third , the restricted opportunity for meaningful discussion , including the absence of free debate and exchange of ideas .  
It was ironic that , despite the explicit recognition at the World Summit for Social Development that problems of underdevelopment required international cooperation , the utility of international development cooperation was being questioned , development assistance had stagnated or declined , and more and more stringent conditionalities were being imposed under social clauses .  
Further deepening of the development process would require an internationally agreed framework that would facilitate the stable , non-discriminatory and reasonable access of developing countries to technology , on the basis of a more transparent , critical and objective evaluation of the restrictions imposed on the grounds of alleged " dual use " .

The measures imposed on the Bosnian Serb party were suspended indefinitely starting on 27 February 1996 , after the Security Council was informed the day before , through the appropriate political authorities , that , in the assessment of the commander of the Implementation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bosnian Serb forces had withdrawn from the zones of separation established in the Peace Agreement ( letters to States and international organizations , SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2 ) and SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2-1 ) ) ;  
In reply to the accusations concerning the right to food and adequate health care , his delegation stressed once again that the system for rationing basic products introduced in 1990 because of the economic sanctions imposed against Iraq applied to all Iraqi citizens without exception or discrimination , which the United Nations missions that had travelled to Iraq and several reports by international organizations could confirm .

I had specified , however , that this plan was being seriously jeopardized by the total economic embargo imposed against Burundi , and I had stressed the urgent need to lift this embargo to allow our country to participate in this important humanitarian operation in many ways , such as by making available the Bujumbura international airport , the hospitals and modern hotels of the capital , the social centres and other reception facilities , the road networks and , especially , hospital and medical personnel .  
Noting the arduous and difficult conditions in which UNRWA carried out its work to assist Palestinian refugees , he said that , at the regional level , Israel was continuing its occupation and escalating its acts of aggression against the Palestinians , and that it had imposed an economic embargo and a curfew , and had destroyed homes and closed schools .  At the international level , donor Governments had not made their contributions to UNRWA activities , and the new Israeli Government had announced that it was repudiating all the principles of the peace process .  
I am sure it is obvious to all persons living in the south that the economic , social and political isolation imposed upon us has been counter-productive as this treatment has helped us to get stronger on our feet and to find adequate alternatives for self-existence , all of which help to consolidate and give permanence to the division of the island .  
While recognizing the discretionary powers of the courts and tribunals in imposing the penalties prescribed by domestic law for acts of racial discrimination , the Committee had often pointed out that the lightness of the penalties imposed in such cases , some of which had affected the fundamental right to life and physical integrity , was not commensurate with the seriousness of the offences .  
Noting with very deep concern that the total economic blockade imposed against Burundi seriously penalizes the most vulnerable social groups , particularly the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons , the tens of thousands of returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ,

Firmly upholds the validity of the principles cited in comparable situations by certain Governments which imposed the embargo against Burundi , namely , that the imposition on a State of an economic , commercial or financial blockade also has adverse consequences for the sovereignty and interests of other countries and that the imposition of one State 's jurisdiction on another State is contrary to the principles of international law ;

Mongolia agrees with the conclusion that democracy is not a model to be copied or imposed , but rather a goal to be attained , and that the pace at which democratization can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture or society .  
In another context , and at the level of the private sector , Egyptian businessmen have not held back initiating a number of economic projects with their Palestinian counterparts designed to enhance the efficiency of the Palestinian economy and save it from the consequences of the destructive closures imposed on it at random by Israel .  
For example , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia both reported that several countries in their region expressed strong concerns regarding their problems in the implementation of and compliance with conventions due to the administrative burden imposed , and the lack of institutional and technical capacities and financial resources .  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
The ban on the export of hazardous products , including those intended for recycling , which has now been imposed by the Basel Convention would remain a dead letter if it were not accompanied by practical measures for the detection of illicit practices .

Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;

The development of future large water-supply systems must adopt pricing that reflects all external costs , including waterlogging ; salinization ; habitat alteration ; impact on endangered species ; long-term deterioration of water quality due to changing land-use practices in catchment areas ; cultural and social dislocation ; and the cost of imposed risks .  
The serious consequences of the sanctions and the embargo imposed on Iraq have aroused widespread international concern in official , political , legal and civic circles .  
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs .

Regretting the failure of the three Western countries to respond positively to international and regional endeavours and to the efforts made to devise a settlement based on the principles of international law , in a context of mutual understanding and constructive dialogue , with the result that the Security Council , following its consultations of 14 March 1997 , extended the embargo measures imposed on the Great Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ,  
Decides to renew , for a three-year period , the mandate of the Working Group composed of five independent experts entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned ;

The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
Even in situations where it may be necessary to impose limitations on such a right , full compliance with article 4 of the Covenant is required so that any limitations imposed must be determined by law only insofar as this may be compatible with the nature of these [ i.e . economic , social and cultural ] rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society .  
That concern was evoked by the fact that the situation in the occupied territories was growing worse each day , as shown by the total blockade of the territories and the restrictions imposed on freedom of movement , which , in turn , had a catastrophic impact on the economic and social situation , health care , education and freedom of religion . 
The Organization of African Unity has consistently expressed its concern over the continued sanctions imposed on that country , with their humanitarian consequences on the ordinary people , and has called for a fair trial of the suspects according to acceptable requirements of justice and international law .  
The devastation and the destruction , as well as the human tragedy resulting from years and years of unrelenting ethnic hatred , witnessed in the fragmented former Yugoslavia ; the division of Cyprus ; the sanctions imposed by the Security Council on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , which continue to have far-reaching effects on neighbouring countries ; the recent turmoil in Albania ; and political instability in some countries because of rampant extremist fundamentalist elements , these are matters of great concern to all the littoral States of the Mediterranean .  
Instead , it had institutionalized the peaceful settlement of disputes through the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and , in case of armed conflict , had imposed certain limits and duties on the parties at war , down to the level of the individual , in the first genuine attempt by the international community to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .

A matter of particular concern was that the unregulated use of sanctions had resulted in unnecessary suffering for innocent civilian populations ; sanctions should be imposed only as a last resort , and the proposals for ameliorating the plight of third States must be carefully studied .

The aim of mine-action programmes , therefore , is not only technical - to survey , mark and eradicate mines - but also humanitarian and developmental - to create an environment in which people can live more safely and in which economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination . 
As public gatherings are considered by individuals and groups as the last remaining alternative means to express publicly differing views and opinions , given the denial of access to Government _ controlled media and the harassment of the independent press , the direct and indirect limitations presently imposed on such events must be considered highly undesirable .  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
Every new charge made by Cuba is supported by more than $ 60-billion in losses and that is not a full assessment by an economy distorted by the war conditions imposed on us , and by the incalculable human , physical and psychological damage we have sustained .  
My country appreciates the enormous efforts made by developed and developing countries alike to address the great challenge of sustainable economic and social development , despite the weighty responsibilities imposed upon them by economic reform .  
The sanctions imposed on Iraq and the foreign interference in its domestic affairs have given rise to clandestine excavations that have enabled their organizers to appropriate and sell cultural property and rare art objects of inestimable value , as well as manuscripts and antique books .  
Whereas : Through the Platt Amendment and its continued intervention and meddling in the internal affairs of the country , the United States of America usurped part of the national territory by installing the Guant \ x { 5ad5 } amo naval base , imposed corrupt and despotic regimes , including the ignominious and bloody tyrannies of Machado and Batista , and since 1959 has systematically attacked Cuba with the declared objective of putting an end to its independence , eliminating Cuban nationality and forcing the population into servitude ,  
The Government of Iraq resorted to the imposition of a tax on travel as a purely administrative and financial measure that was not intended to impede travel by citizens or discriminate between them on political or social grounds ; it was necessitated by the situation brought about by the iniquitous economic embargo imposed on Iraq .  
The country does not have the technical , physical or human resources to manufacture weapons of mass destruction , since its principal concern is to promote its economic development plan and to mitigate the adverse impact that the coercive measures imposed on our people have had on all aspects of life .  
Mr . Al-Humaimidi ( Iraq ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the comments made by the United States representative following the introduction of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq had been motivated by that countrys desire to prevent the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq , despite Iraqs full compliance with the relevant Security Council resolution and contrary to the views of most members of the international community . 
The Committee also notes the major problems experienced as a consequence of the armed conflict , which has imposed serious hardships on the entire population , including heavy casualties , long _ lasting physical , emotional and psychological effects , and the disruption of some basic services .  
The Front ( UINFSA ) calls upon the Taliban to take into serious account the sufferings and miseries of the innocent civilian population in Afghanistan resulting from the protracted imposed war and to declare their readiness through joining a genuine intra-Afghan dialogue aimed at achieving a negotiated settlement , rather than pursuing the dangerous option of continuing war in Afghanistan .  
United Nations agencies should encourage small States to adopt regional approaches , wherever advantageous , with relevant assistance justified in cost-benefit terms and focused on human resources development , environmental activities and reducing the administrative constraints imposed by small size .  
The international community and States should take all the necessary measures to protect the rights of vulnerable segments of the population and give very serious consideration to holding a large _ scale discussion on the practice of embargoes and economic sanctions which are imposed on States and have adverse consequences for the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights of the segments concerned ;

Despite the severe economic difficulties brought about by the unjust economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , her Government had paid the sum of $ 1.193-million to the Organization during the previous week ; that was a reflection of Cuba 's commitment to the Organization .  
It has done so despite the exceptional circumstances , well known to the international community , that Iraq is experiencing because of the maintenance of the comprehensive embargo imposed on it in August 1990 and because of the brutal military aggression of January 1991 that created highly abnormal conditions in all spheres of civilian life and for all groups of the population .  
He is in a better position than others to know that the harsh conditions imposed on Iraq by a devastating embargo that has entered its eighth year would have destroyed the country 's social structure had it not been for the dedicated commitment of the Government of Iraq to protecting the cohesion of the Iraqi people and safeguarding social and moral values and social solidarity .  
It has not been satisfied with ruining building sites in the occupied Golan since 1967 , including the liberated town of Quneitra , and established in their stead Israeli settlements whose number has gradually increased and risen to 40 settlements inhabited now by about 17,000 Israeli settlers , while suppression is imposed on building throughout the occupied Syrian villages , with heavy taxes imposed on building , which has resulted in an abnormal rise of building prices which is very onerous to the population . 
The Government of Belarus has never employed economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion and does not recognize the validity of any coercive measures or legislative acts of an extraterritorial nature that are imposed by any State on a unilateral basis .  
Since recovering its full independence in 1959 , Cuba has been subjected to all manner of coercive measures , characterized by pressure , threats and hostilities whose stated purpose is to subvert the political , economic and social alternative chosen by the Cuban people in exercise of their sovereignty .  The clearest expression of this increasingly aggressive conduct is the permanent economic , commercial and financial blockade unilaterally imposed against Cuba for almost four decades by the Government of the United States of America , involving an endless list of various types of coercive economic measures .  
Iraq is a developing country that is suffering greatly as a result of the coercive economic policies and measures exemplified in the complete economic embargo imposed on it more than seven years ago that affect the health of the Iraqi people and every aspect of its economic , social and cultural life .  
Further , the humanitarian considerations that the Holy See applies to economic sanctions were articulated by His Eminence Angelo Cardinal Sodano , Secretary of State , who stated that the Holy See hoped that the Security Council would be better informed about the negative effects , on a humanitarian level , deriving from the application of sanctions imposed on a State in strict application of the Charter of the United Nations .  
Although such measures may be imposed not only by individual States , but also by a group of States , the determination or judgement of alleged wrongful or objectionable policies of target States subject to coercive economic measures is made by sender State ( s ) largely on a unilateral or narrow-group basis .  
Where a countrys capacity to develop and implement a comprehensive economic programme has been disrupted by conflict , consideration must be given to relaxing the normally strict financial conditions imposed by international lending institutions .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities are punishable in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties are imposed .

Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
My Governments pattern of payments clearly reflects its unshakable determination to meet its budgetary obligations despite the extraordinary difficulties it is facing as a result of the rigid , irrational and inhuman economic , commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America on Cuba for more than three long decades .  
It was pointed out , however , that the obligation to operate a CRL might be appropriate for high-value transactions and certificates ( i.e . , for those enhanced electronic signatures that were intended to produce legal effect ) but would be overly burdensome ( and contrary to existing practice ) if it were to be imposed with respect to all certificates ( including cheap certificates used in the context of significant numbers of digital signatures ) .  
Noting with grave concern the content of the report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Organization , [ 5 ] appointed in March 1997 in accordance with article 26 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization , regarding the observance by Myanmar of the Forced Labour Convention , 1930 ( No .  29 ) , which indicates a widespread and systematic use of forced labour imposed by the military on the civilian population ,  
Some consider that the permanent nature of the organization is the source of unacceptable waste at a time when budgetary austerity is being imposed on all countries and at a stage in our economic history which is haunted by the spectre of crisis and unemployment among both poor and rich .  
Affirms , on behalf of the Ethiopian people , that , while Ethiopia shall always be committed , with all the necessary resolve , to principles of international law governing inter-State relations and to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations , it shall , on the other hand , accept no unfair , unjustified or inappropriate restrictions imposed on its right to self-defence , which all self-respecting nations take for granted ;  
The Working Group is composed of five independent experts , with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal [ corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
Iraq , in particular , is suffering from the effects of a disease that is incurring large-scale economic costs in terms of the quantities of red meat and dairy products lost , thereby exacerbating the suffering of many Iraqis already undernourished owing to the maintenance of the unjust embargo imposed on the country .  
Iraq and its people are daily being subjected by the United States and its dependency , the United Kingdom , to heinous acts of international terrorism , inasmuch as the governments of these two countries are maintaining no-flight zones in the national airspace of the Republic of Iraq , as well as to their frantic attempts to interfere in Iraq 's internal affairs and to their insistence on maintaining the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq in 1990 .  
In connection with the other 50 per cent , spare parts for existing medical equipment and new medical equipment have been imported , the importation of these items having been adversely affected by the unjust embargo imposed nearly nine years ago , given that they are to be regarded as integral to the diagnostic process . 
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal [ corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
One of the major problems identified by the Mission was the blockade imposed by the federal authorities on humanitarian assistance entering Montenegro through the port of Bar or from Croatia ( e.g . a large convoy of humanitarian aid including medical supplies destined for internally displaced persons had been blocked by the federal authorities for 10 days inside Montenegro ) .  
It is also considered crucial that the next generation of operational observing systems be designed specifically to meet the more stringent requirements imposed by the need for the detection of climate and global change .  
The secretariat also highlighted the considerable strain imposed on it by high vacancy rates , which were compounded by lengthy procedures for filling posts and restrictive rules on the hiring of temporary staff , but assured delegations that it could and would carry out all the work assigned to it .  
The United States , which has continued to apply laws and measures affecting the sovereignty and legitimate interests of other States and freedom of trade and navigation , as well as inflicting tremendous pain on the Cuban people , should , in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions of the United Nations , put an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo that it has imposed on Cuba .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
That the United States of America continues to ignore the will of the international community , as embodied in the successive resolutions adopted by the General Assembly with a view to lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba , is to be regarded as a flagrant violation of the principles and norms of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations .  
In conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and out of respect for the norms of international law , the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has neither promulgated nor applied any laws of the kind referred to in the relevant paragraph of General Assembly resolution 53 / 4 .  3 .  For more than a decade and a half , the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has been enduring measures imposed upon it by the United States of America that are similar to those being maintained against Cuba .  
On the basis of the foregoing , the Sudan opposes the economic and commercial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , which has caused great damage to the Cuban people and violated its legitimate rights and interests , being a flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations and showing disregard for their lofty and noble principles .  
Venezuela believes that unilateral measures that are extraterritorial and coercive in nature , such as the embargo imposed against Cuba , have a negative effect on the legal regime which defines economic and trade relations between nations and an adverse impact on the efforts that have been carried out in order to achieve economic integration at both the continental and subregional levels .  
The policies and laws of economic , commercial and financial blockade and embargo of the United States of America imposed on the Republic of Cuba in the last decades violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and run counter to the common trends of our world today , namely cooperation for development on the basis of equality amongst sovereign States and non-discrimination of political systems .  
This demonstrates not only the unanimous agreement of the international community on the urgency for the abolition of these obsolete policies , which have been imposed on the Cuban people for so long , but also the common desire for the development of healthy international political relations , the strengthening of international cooperation for the development of all nations , an irreversible trend of the twenty-first century . 
UNICEF has actively publicized its view that it is unacceptable that a clear ban on childrens recruitment has not yet been imposed on the direct and indirect participation in hostilities of children below 18 years of age , regardless of whether they have been forced to join armed forces , or whether they appear to have done so voluntarily ; this applies equally to governmental and non-governmental forces .  
He was held responsible for 11 counts of murder , torture , rape , causing great suffering or serious injury and inhumane acts and a number of concurrent sentences were imposed by the Trial Chamber , the maximum being 20 years ' imprisonment for murder and wilful killing .  
As a representative of a State subjected to an unprecedented humanitarian disaster due to the sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the aggression carried out daily by two permanent Council Members , I launch an appeal to the Council to abandon the double standard and to be true to the role assigned to it in the Charter .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
Anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant market positions limit market access and market entry to major developed country markets ; they include exclusive dealing , market sharing , export restraints imposed on licensees and joint venture partners , and denial of access to international networks and technology markets .  
Those developments had taken place despite the coercive economic sanctions imposed on the Libyan people in the early 1990s , which had caused it enormous losses and had impeded plans and programmes designed to meet the needs of vulnerable groups in society .  
The easier path towards an acceptable definition of aggression would have to recognize limitations imposed by the Charter , as well as practical limitations reflecting the need for the international community to respond to humanitarian and other crises without being harassed or , much worse , being charged with violations of the Statute .  
The representatives of the people of Iraq urge an immediate halt to the daily attacks being carried out by United States and British aircraft under the cloak of the so-called aerial exclusion zones imposed on Iraq without any legal basis , inasmuch as these attacks target civilian and services-related installations such as electric power stations and water treatment plants in such a way as to affect the lives of Iraqis in an adverse manner and inflict harm on them .  
The devastating impact of the war on all aspects of Afghan society is compounded by a combination of poverty , profound underdevelopment , the absence of representative and accountable governance mechanisms and the marginalization of particular groups , including the severe restrictions imposed on the participation of women and girls in public life . 
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Similarly , the rules of the multilateral financial institutions , implicit in the conditionalities of the IMF and the World Bank , which are applicable only to deficit countries or borrowing countries , should be reshaped so that the standardized package of policies , which is inflexible , is not imposed on countries , irrespective of time and space , particularly where some of its elements are not consistent with national development objectives in the long term .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
It was also explained that the words [ six months ] in paragraph 3 ( a ) reflected the view of some delegations that : ( i ) a maximum time-limit should be imposed for the carrying out of a visit / mission beginning at the time of the notification so that a notification was not left without being acted upon ; and ( ii ) a minimum period of prior notification should be required before any mission / visit took place .  
The economic sanctions that the Security Council imposes on a number of countries , usually developing countries , and unilateral coercive measures are significant factors that halt the realization of the right to development , cause material and human losses in the development process and require many years to offset , particularly if such economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council continue for a long and indefinite period of time .  
Those decisions reflected the political and economic interests of those States , as illustrated by the fact that , in February 1990 , the United States Administration imposed restrictions on the fulfilment of contracts for agricultural and industrial shipments which had been concluded with Iraq six months earlier .  
Those measures unquestionably prove that those States not only imposed unilateral sanctions on Iraq in advance of those decided upon by the Security Council of the United Nations but also laid down regulations for the sanctions imposed by the Security Council , as a result of which the application of the sanctions became an ongoing institutionalized process that clearly showed that those States intended to perpetuate the embargo .  
At its forty-seventh session , in resolution 1991 / 42 , the Commission decided to create , for a three-year period , a working group composed of five independent experts , with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with relevant international standards or the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out the revised mandate of the Group , which is to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
All this has had a positive effect on the quality of life in Libyan society , as has the provision of all basic social services , despite the coercive economic sanctions that have been imposed on the people of Libya in 1990 s , caused serious human and material damage and hampered programmes and plans devoted to social development .  
If the political manipulation of human rights continues the selectivity , partiality and double standards ; if economic and social rights are ignored ; if the right to development is disregarded ; if a sectarian and abstract international human rights law is imposed ; and if all human rights are not guaranteed for all human beings conflicts will continue .  
Mr . Mra ( Myanmar ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegations appreciation for the Secretary-Generals report contained in document A 54-259 , dated 18 August 1999 , on agenda item 33 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
In keeping with these positions and on the basis of the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter and universally recognized principles of international law , Mali will this year again associate itself with the Member States calling for the lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States of America .  
The report ( A 54-259 ) of the Secretary-General shows , as have his previous reports on the subject , the destructive results of the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba as a coercive and unilateral measure .  
Since the ultimate objective of these measures is to undermine international peace and security and create political and economic instability in other countries , the Islamic Republic of Iran , like other members of the international community , advocates the removal and elimination of all economic and trade embargoes imposed upon Cuba , and believes that differences between States should be settled in a peaceful manner .  
The continuing sanctions and embargo imposed by the United States Government have posed great difficulties for the Cuban people in their endeavour to achieve economic and social development and reform , thus seriously constraining the Cuban Governments efforts to eradicate poverty and enhance its peoples living standards.Cuban women and children have borne the brunt of the suffering , especially in terms of their health and welfare . 
But we must remember that it is a process : a series of steps which build upon each other so that the final result , which we firmly believe to be achievable , will have come about through gradual , careful and deliberate negotiation and not through imperfect solutions imposed from outside or as a consequence of inherent power imbalances or short-term political expediency .  
Nonetheless , it is also natural , in a democratic international community based on the principles of equitable geographic representation and the sovereign equality of States , that changes to the collective security system be the result of a genuine general agreement , instead of being imposed .  
Since all of these conditions have been met , the illegal , brutal and massive economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by the neighbouring countries should be lifted because the country is on the verge of suffocation and the suffering of innocent people is indescribable ; famine is imminent ; and diseases such as meningitis and cholera are epidemic due to a lack of medication .  
Despite the budgetary constraints imposed by the current international financial crisis , Brazil had already pledged a contribution to the Trust Fund set up to support the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and encouraged other countries to do the same .  
The objective of health policy is to correct the imbalances in the national health system and make health care provision more effective and equitable , taking account of the constraints on choice imposed by the repercussions of demographic pressure and changes , the roles of the participants , and the funding and administration mechanisms for the sector .  
Moreover , in the case of securitization of mortgage loans , an assignment against the consumer-debtor may materially increase the burden of risk imposed on the consumer-debtor ( if , e.g . , the mortgage loan is assigned by the friendly local savings and loans bank to a foreign lender , who may be more aggressive in the collection of the outstanding amounts of the loan or in handling any variable interest rate ) .  
The Basel Convention and the national laws of the countries visited regard the illegal traffic in dangerous waste as a criminal act liable to punishment under criminal law , regardless of any civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on persons found guilty of such trafficking .  
At its forty-seventh session , in resolution 1991-42 , the Commission decided to create , for a three-year period , a working group composed of five independent experts , with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with relevant international standards or the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
Under the new article , if the active subject engages in such conduct habitually ; abuses trust or authority ; uses deception , violence or intimidation ; is an older or younger relative , husband , brother , guardian , caregiver or person responsible for the upbringing of the victim ; or if the victim is a minor , the prison sentence is increased from the maximum medium term ( 5 years ) to any of the longer terms ( 5 years and 1 day to 20 years ) imposed by article 367 .  
Article 17 of the Criminal Code stipulates that persons who act as accessories after the fact for their spouse or legitimate relatives by blood or marriage , throughout the direct and collateral lines up to the second degree , as well as natural parents and children born out of wedlock , shall be exempt from the penalties imposed for concealment , unless they have profited from the effects of the crime or ordinary offence . 
International economic sanctions , particularly when imposed by the Security Council , should be conceived in such a way as to avoid aggravating conditions of extreme poverty in the countries concerned.In particular , they should be compatible with the effective exercise of human rights _ and especially economic , social and cultural rights _ by civilians .  
In its report on part one of the first instalment of F1 claims , the Panel discussed the legal framework within which the claims of Governments and international organizations would be decided by the Commission . 5 ] The discussion covered the law applicable to the category F claims , the procedural and evidentiary requirements imposed on the Claimants and the Panels role in the proceedings . 
In this connection , Ukraine underlines the importance of a more active and practical participation of the international financial institutions in providing additional financial assistance to the affected economies , and reiterates its earlier proposals to that effect , as contained in its position paper on the problems of implementation of the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council ( see A 51-226 , annex-S 1996 595 , annex ) .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
By resolution 1132 ( 1997 ) , adopted on 8 October 1997 , the Security Council , gravely concerned at the continued violence following the military coup of 25 May 1997 and determining that the situation in Sierra Leone constituted a threat to international peace and security in the region , imposed a regime of mandatory sanctions , under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , against Sierra Leone .  
It is instructive to conclude from it that the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba is a unilateral action , whose extraterritorial effects have no validity in public international law .  
My delegation is equally concerned about the illegal and humiliating economic blockade that is being imposed on the Palestinian people , resulting in tremendous suffering and in financial losses amounting to several hundred-million dollars .  
It is a sad and sobering reality that , because of measures imposed or conditions existing in certain countries , women continue to be deprived of basic and fundamental human rights , such as the right to education or the right to gainful employment .  
For the sixth survey , States were invited to list specific legal definitions of offences for which capital punishment could be imposed , according to whether the capital offences were considered ordinary or special .  
There is however no easy fix for the institutional impediments in many developing countries , above all unsupportive regulatory environments and exorbitant charges imposed by national authorities .  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;  
Again calls upon all States not to recognize or apply unilateral extraterritorial coercive economic measures imposed by any State , which are contrary to recognized principles of international law ;

Mr . Salman ( Iraq ) affirmed that the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq constituted an example of cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment and of violence against men , women and children who had sustained considerable material and physical suffering .  
Very harsh penalties were imposed on drug traffickers , ranging from life imprisonment to capital punishment , because drug trafficking was considered premeditated attempted homicide against innocent people .  
The inhuman and archaic embargoes imposed on the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus are in blatant violation of the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and in total contravention of the relevant international human rights instruments .  
The constraints imposed by severe poverty on economic development and social progress in some developing countries , combined with other factors , such as ethnic and territorial dispute , have caused disturbances , and even armed conflict , in these countries .  
Reports of United Nations specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations have highlighted the catastrophic effects the comprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq have had , claiming the lives of more than 1.5-million people , mostly children .  It is shocking and scandalous that , according to UNICEF , half a-million children under the age of five could have been saved had sanctions not been imposed on Iraq .  
With respect to the financing of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , although the regular budget for the biennium 2000-2001 included a modest increase in the resources allocated to the human rights programme , it was not sufficient to meet the demand imposed by the growing number of human rights programmes carried out by the United Nations system .  
Thus , for example , this article underlines the importance of respect for parents , of the need to view rights within their broader ethical , moral , spiritual , cultural or social framework , and of the fact that most childrens rights , far from being externally imposed , are embedded within the values of local communities . 
Those realities were nothing more than the consequences of illegal acts which had gone unpunished and of the unacceptable partition imposed through the use of force and sustained by military strength in violation of every norm of international law ; they presupposed the constant denial of the individual and collective rights of 200,000 refugees ( more than a third of the Greek Cypriot population of Cyprus ) , who had been forcibly expelled from their homes since the Turkish invasion .  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out its revised mandate , which is to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Deplores the continued executions in the apparent absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards , in particular public and especially cruel executions , and urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that capital punishment will not be imposed for crimes other than the most serious and will not be pronounced in disregard of the obligations it has assumed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the provisions of United Nations safeguards , and to provide the Special Representative with relevant statistics on this matter ;  
The Working Group is composed of five independent experts with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Thus , for example , this article underlines the importance of respect for parents , of the need to view rights within their broader ethical , moral , spiritual , cultural or social framework , and of the fact that most childrens rights , far from being externally imposed , are embedded within the values of local communities .  
These two countries are using armed force on a daily basis against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in the two no-flight zones that they imposed by their unilateral decision , and these two countries are supporting , funding and training terrorist groups for the purpose of undermining Iraqs security and threatening its territorial integrity . 
The United States of America and the United Kingdom are committing acts of aggression and violating Iraqs airspace and territory on a daily basis on the pretext of allegedly enforcing the illegal and unlawful no-flight zones that were imposed by these two countries in a pathological display of military power that poses a threat to the security and safety of innocent civilian citizens and represents an assault on the sovereignty of an independent Member State of the United Nations .  
The harm done to the Cuban people has been established before competent judicial authorities and abundantly documented in the reports submitted to the General Assembly each year by the Secretary-General under the item Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
Human solidarity and social justice will ultimately win out over the egoistic , unjust conceptions that serve as pillars of the existing international economic order , aggravated by the neoliberal precepts imposed on the current globalization process .

Considers it essential that the international community continue to follow very closely the situation of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups and bring the necessary pressure to bear so that all the restrictions imposed on women , which constitute flagrant and systematic violations of all the internationally recognized economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , are removed ;  
As part of the rigid economic , financial and commercial blockade imposed on Cuba for more than 40 years , various actions have targeted our programme for the peaceful use of nuclear energy to prevent its advance .  
Notes the progress achieved in the area of common premises and shared services at the country level within the United Nations system , recognizes the need to justify the pursuit of common premises on the basis of the adequate nature and size of the development cooperation programmes and projects , reaffirms the need to take fully into account cost-benefit studies as called for in relevant resolutions , and encourages further implementation of such initiatives , where appropriate , while ensuring that there will be no additional burden imposed on host countries ;  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out the revised mandate of the Group , which is to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .

This reporter has learned of the following information from the National Anti-Pornography Office : All localities in China have stepped up the crackdown on illegal publications , applying the law in harshly punishing the criminals involved in illegal publication cases .  Since the second half of 1999 , local judicial organs have again tried a number of important cases , imposed sentences on the perpetrators , and struck a powerful blow at and deterred criminals .  
The main responsible official and directly responsible official of a unit which has used fiscal funds , raised money , or imposed levies for the building or expansion of any commemorative facility in violation of the rules shall be dealt with sternly in accordance with the relevant provisions of party and government discipline .  
The restriction on projects on which restriction must be imposed can also be appropriately relaxed so long as such projects are conducive to the development of the western region and do not affect local environmental protection or the overall situation of national economic construction .  
The General Department of Politics proposed the education 's objective , composed of four aspects , including " strengthening ideals and convictions , putting into full play exemplary models , improving the atmosphere of the grassroots units and fortifying the role of Party organizations " .  This objective embodies the fundamental requirements of the " three represents " imposed on the Party 's basic-level organizations and its members throughout the military .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
It is understood that " sewage charges " are charged according to the monthly water consumption of enterprises ( including foreign-invested enterprises and units ) and different rates are imposed on industrial enterprises , tertiary enterprises and public institutions .  " Sewage charges " on enterprises that have not yet met environmental protection standards are several times higher than for enterprises that are up to standard .  
However , we maintain that the United States should assume moral responsibility .  So the United States should be the first to take the next step , show as much goodwill as it possibly can , and make diplomatic mediation in a sustained manner .  If the United States confines itself , exerts verbal pressure , and even hints that trade sanctions may possibly be imposed and that several punitive measures may be applied with regard to the arms sales to Taiwan , no benefit will be brought to the current stalemate .  
As expected , soon after the editorial was published , Tsai Ing-wen announced on 16 April to the outside world : " The report submitted by the Mainland Affairs Council to the Executive Yuan on the issue of revising the policy of ' no haste , restraint ' will have to revised with the factor of economic changes taken into account . "  " Only after completing a thorough analysis of the risks involved will the government start lifting restrictions imposed by ' no haste , be patient ' . "  
3 .  The mainland failed to coordinate .  Due to the differences of views between its central and local authorities and between its different local authorities , it lacked unified policies for approving and issuing entry certificates to the people of our side .  It also deferred in eliminating the obstacles of laws to its commodity imports and exports and imposed strict restrictions on its people 's visits to Kinmen and Matsu , thus limiting the implementation of the three mini links .  
In addition , some stress cooperation among the cities in the course of economic globalization in an attempt to " get rid of constraints imposed by states " .  Such a view is as a matter of fact an attempt to break down the existing legal system in various countries , which runs counter to the interests of developing countries and is not conducive to improving habitat conditions in those countries .  
The vigorous development of the CPC 's international liaison work was of great significance in new China 's efforts to break through the political isolation and economic blockade imposed by the Western countries , and in consolidating its newfound political power .  At that time , it also impacted on the peace and national liberation movements throughout the world .  
The responsible official at the foreign trade division of MOFTEC concluded that all the aforementioned facts showed that the temporary protective measures the Japanese side imposed against the three Chinese farm products severely ran counter to WTO rules in terms of its procedure and its substantial content .  
It may also bring us some possible and unpredictable difficulties and risks .  This new situation has imposed a new and even higher demand on the standards of Party and government leading bodies and cadres at and above the county level , particularly their ideological and political standards and their ability to handle complicated situation and solve actual problems .  
Article 28 .  The persons who have obstructed and hindered pipeline enterprises from conducting normal check-up rounds , maintenance , and rash repairs of pipeline and auxiliary facilities in violation of the stipulations of these regulations shall be ordered to correct their errors by designated departments under local people 's governments at and above the county level ; besides , a fine of no more than 2,000 yuan can be imposed on an individual , while a fine of no more than 50,000 yuan , on a unit .  
At home , Junichiro Koizumi has never experienced the same hardships endured by the broad masses of laboring people .  While studying abroad , Junichiro Koizumi never bothered to learn about , either , the miseries suffered by the people of neighboring Asian countries when the Japanese militarists invaded their countries and imposed colonial rule .  
However , as far as its essence is concerned , only the pattern of integration of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , which gives expression to the basic connotation of the integration pattern , can in a fundamental way do away with the restrictions imposed by " departments and regions , " thoroughly break down the pattern in which logistics support to the three armed forces is provided separately , and really effect a leap from the joint rear service support to integrated logistics support for the three armed forces .  
Gao Dezhan said : It is necessary to work intensively to formulate laws for protecting peasants ' rights and interests in connection with the ongoing rural taxation and fee-collection reforms ; and according to the laws , stop the irregular practice of some local governments and departments in collecting fees , imposing fines , and raising funds among peasants in various forms and names .  Thus , the peasant 's legitimate rights and interests can be protected by the legal means , and the burdens imposed on them can be reduced .

Standing committee member Feng Henggao emphasized that the draft amendments should set forth express provisions against judicial corruption , so as to eliminate any bias out of favoritism and monetary consideration .  He suggested that more measures should be adopted to strengthen supervision of judges and procurators by the people 's congress , the mass media , and the public , and heavier punishment should be imposed on any law enforcement personnel that violate laws , so as to prevent and reduce judicial corruption .

"  
The " 10th Five-Year " plan has imposed further demands on reform of the SOEs , as they must accomplish a strategic readjustment of their position in the national economy .  There are things they should engage in , and things they should n't .  Namely , they should pull out of those competitive areas which are not suited to SOE development , while those SOEs which it is necessary to retain should achieve the diversification of entities investing in them through the form of joint-stock companies , establishing a modern enterprise system and improving their economic management .  
In addition , the government has imposed mandatory reductions on some industries with excess production capacity ( such as the textiles , iron and steel , and coal-mining industries ) and limited their output .  Enterprises that used backward technology or caused heavy pollution were ordered to close .  In response to market competition , moreover , some enterprises have closed their doors , gone out of business , suspended operations , or scaled back production .  
Chen Guangfu , responsible person of the interdepartmental joint meeting on reducing enterprise burdens held by the State Council , urged that prior to 30 June this year , all collection of charges , fines , funds , and fund raising related to township enterprises that are not in line with stipulations must be comprehensively abolished .  Those that are above the prescribed standards must be rechecked .  Duplicated collection of charges must be merged together , and all apportionment imposed on township enterprises must be resolutely stopped .  
After the implementation of these reform measures , there was for the most part a significant " clearing of the corruption " in a short period of time , so farmers had the opportunity to relax and generate profits .  But in the end , because of the restrictions imposed by the social and political environment at that time , the opposite result was the outcome , with the base for future taxes actually increasing , and the farmers ' burden was heavier .  
Earlier , in 1995 , former US President Clinton announced that economic sanctions would be imposed against Iran , thereby restricting all trade and investment with companies in the US and abroad .  Iran 's supposed hampering of the Middle East peace process , support of international terrorism , and a probe into weapons of mass destruction were the pretext for the decision .  
The Chinese people have never recognised the unequal treaties imposed on them , never forgotten for a single day the humiliating state of Hong Kong under occupation and never stopped their indomitable struggle for state sovereignty and national emancipation .  
" Having given careful consideration to the facts of this case , and to the established legal principles , the Secretary for Justice decided that the sentences imposed are authorised by law , and can not be said to be wrong in principle or manifestly inadequate , " he said .

The Housing Authority has relaxed a restriction on public rental flat allocation in the Urban District to allow selected applicants on the Waiting List ( WL ) to take up vacant flats in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island . The Authority 's Rental Housing Committee ( RHC ) approved today ( Thursday ) to relax the restriction rule imposed in 1990 debarring WL applicants registered after 13 December 1990 from opting for the Urban District , with the exception of Elderly Persons Priority Scheme ( EPS ) .

For cases which can not be established by these procedures , neuropathological examination of the brain through autopsy would be conducted to establish the diagnosis . ( d ) The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department ( FEHD ) , in line with recommendations of the relevant international authorities , including Office International des Epizooties and World Health Organization , has imposed additional sanitary requirements on beef products imported from European Union countries which have reported cases of mad cow disease to prevent and control the spread of the disease in Hong Kong . 
However , the RHC agreed that second priority green form status will be given to non-property-owning households who fail the CMT with income and asset limits set at HSP and SRA levels but opt to purchase Home Ownership Scheme ( HOS ) flats or take other subsidised housing opportunities .  Applicants who fail the CMT pitched at WL levels will still be subject to the eligibility criteria imposed on white form applicants .  
Given the history of China over the past 200 years , when wars were imposed by foreign countries on her , wars were fought and lost , when territories were ceded , when war reparations needed to be made , when people 's dignity was lost and the country was driven to extreme poverty , Chinese people of successive generations including those of today yearn strongly for peace , stability and prosperity , for the restoration of dignity and international standing and for the preservation of territorial integrity . 
Magistrate Lo Pui Yin pointed out that the defendant had substantive control over the complainant such as when and how the beautician worked , what services were to be provided by the beautician and the obligations imposed on the beautician to observe the detailed staff rules .  Besides , @ noting that a regular monthly basic salary was paid to the beautician , the court ruled that the beautician was an employee of the defendant .  
At the legislative level , sites and structures with outstanding historical and architectural / archaeological values are declared as monuments , and stringent statutory restrictions imposed to prohibit demolition and limit alteration .  
We will introduce legislative amendments in the middle of this year to require installation of particulate traps and catalytic converters on all pre-Euro light diesel vehicles .  The same statutory requirements will be imposed on all pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles upon completion of the current programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting of catalytic converters next year .  
Because the Japanese military imposed strict order , any photography that included topographic features , military bases , or indeed any photo whose field of vision extended downward more than 45 degrees had to be approved by the military police . Thus it was difficult for ordinary people to photograph freely outdoors .  
Teach fishermen restraintAlthough Taiwan 's tiny community of marine scholars has already been worn thin studying ocean-dwelling mammals , NTOU , the only institution engaged in shark research , put forth a five-year plan for basic research in this area . Their goal is to understand the local shark catch situation and provide data for reference if controls are imposed in the future .  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
Old hunting grounds have been claimed by the state , with every tree and blade of grass strictly protected . With heavy punishments imposed from above , and the attraction of external economic opportunities , the social status of hunters has dropped precipitously , from an honored class to a virtually criminal class .  
Such questions are ignored , as are the intangible emotional aspects of morality , such as self-esteem , self-respect , caring for others , and even a sense of shame , a sense of guilt , moral courage and so on . Thus morality can easily become superficial or even a complete sham , adopted for show but not practiced in reality . In other words , under these circumstances moral actions never advance beyond the stage of " heteronomous morality " [ imposed by outside authority ] , and are unlikely to come from the heart .  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , with over 170 member states , places wild animals into one of four categories depending upon the size of their surviving populations and how endangered the species may be . Various controls and limitations on import , export , and trade are then imposed for the various categories . Protected animals may only be imported under certain conditions , such as for educational purposes or medical treatment , but not for profit .  
In 1988 , Hungary relaxed its immigration laws and concluded a bilateral visa exemption treaty with the PRC . In one fell swoop , thousands of Chinese people poured into Hungary . In a few years , their numbers increased more than tenfold , and when the Hungarian authorities realized that the situation was getting out of hand , they quickly imposed restrictions .  
Mr . Joudeh informed the Special Committee how he had lost his entire crop and stopped farming as a result of the prolonged curfews imposed in the occupied territories after the Gulf War :  
The system of apartheid sought to dehumanize entire peoples and imposed on the region of southern Africa a brutal war which has resulted in untold loss of life , destruction of property and massive displacement of innocent people .  
Deeply preoccupied by the increasingly heavy burden being imposed , particularly upon developing countries with limited resources of their own and upon the international community as a whole , by these sudden mass exoduses and displacements of population ,  
The point is that , in such cases , there should be a minimum level of safeguards , through the application of a set of agreed , uniform rules and procedures , in order for the imposing and lifting of sanctions to take place in a manner that strikes a balance between , on the one hand , the interests of the international community and , on the other , the extent of the human suffering endured by peoples on whom the sanctions are imposed .  
Our people find it astonishing that in an era of such developed mass communication , which leaves no distance between different corners of the globe , the apparently insurmountable difficulties in particular , the actual causes of the continuing imposed war are not understood .  
Unless the Organization effectively demonstrates its ability to guarantee the international legal order over and above " international policies " dominated by the most powerful nations , under which economic and trade embargoes are imposed and the principles of non-intervention are violated , the international system will without doubt soon be in its painful and prolonged death throes .  
This is the case of the economic , commercial and financial blockade that for more than 34 years has been imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba , in violation of the most fundamental norms of international law , of peaceful coexistence among sovereign and independent nations , and of freedom of trade and navigation .  
In this regard , despite extensive damage caused by the imposed war and other economic pressures , the Islamic Republic of Iran , endowed with the resolve and work ethic of its entire population , has been able not only to move towards reversing the vast destruction of the war , but also successfully to complete its first five-year economic and social development plan and embark upon the implementation of the second five-year plan on solid foundations .  
This statement of intent has changed nothing : the reality of the situation is that the sanctions imposed on Iraq have been continued as a means of collectively punishing an entire people , and the steps required from Iraq to end the sanctions have remained as vague as they have always been in the Council 's resolutions , as in paragraph 21 of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , for instance .  
However , factors of history and constraints imposed by the external economic environment in particular , reduced official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , worsening terms of trade and increased barriers hindering access to markets in the developed countries have prevented any fundamental improvement in their economic situation .  
Those Governments that are thus accused of failure to live up to international humanitarian standards are subjected to unilateral arms embargoes imposed on them by the arms - exporting countries , whereas the perpetrators of violence who procure their weapons , perhaps from the very same sources , are never held accountable for their illegal and destabilizing activities .  
These figures may demonstrate the extent to which the lives of innocent civilians in Iraq are at risk over and above the threats posed to them by the shortage of food and medicine and the adverse health situation owing to the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq and by the Iraqi people 's lack of access to the most elementary and basic humanitarian needs .  
On this issue , it is important that we be clear about the goals of the sanctions imposed , the need for a timely agreement on precise conditions and machinery for lifting them once they have fulfilled their purpose , the inadmissibility of tightening sanctions if that would hinder the process of a political settlement , and the vital need to consider humanitarian factors .  
The United States has been alarmed and disconcerted by the political stability enjoyed by the Libyan people , by the fact that it rallies to its leadership and by its steadfast character despite the iniquitous economic embargo imposed as a result of the hegemony of certain major Powers in the Security Council , chiefly the United States of America itself .  
Another representative pointed out that the idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law as regards the constituent elements of crimes and the penalties to be imposed was worth considering , although the manner in which that was effected would require careful study .  
The loss of life , the destruction of property , the disruption of the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians living in the western Beqaa and South Lebanon now seriously aggravated by the interdiction imposed by the Israeli naval blockade on thousands of fishermen to carry on their only gainful activity , are all acts of blatant Israeli defiance of the precepts of international law and Security Council resolutions 425 ( 1978 ) , 426 ( 1978 ) and 509 ( 1982 ) .  
The duty imposed on the Prosecutor in paragraph 1 raised once again the difficulties involved in reconciling the respective responsibilities of the international criminal court and those of national authorities .  
We , Yugoslav physicians and other health workers , call upon all the progressive forces of mankind , and particularly cultural and humanitarian organizations , to raise their voices , guided by principles of humanism , ethics and democracy , against the perils of international sanctions imposed on the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and call for putting an end to that unique concentration camp in the world of today .  
In addition , ongoing technological innovations over the years have imposed an extraordinary burden on the mechanical and electrical support systems , which are now operating at full capacity , making them inadequate and inefficient and resulting in higher energy consumption and increased utility costs .  
In its letter to the President of the General Assembly and in subsequent oral and written representations to the Committee on Contributions , Iraq stated its view and stressed that its inability to pay resulted from the comprehensive embargo imposed by Security Council resolutions , which had deprived Iraq of its financial resources .  
The failures of the international community in providing protection to the people of Bosnia , in halting policies of ethnic cleansing , as constituting a war crime and a crime against humanity , and in ending the deliberate obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian assistance mean that we must reconsider the maintenance of the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia with a view to enabling its people to exercise its legitimate right to self-defence .  
They continued to suffer the effects of an unfavourable economic environment characterized by the ongoing deterioration in the terms of trade , their staggering external debt burden and currency devaluations imposed under structural adjustment programmes , and aggravated by the negative impact of the agreements resulting from multilateral trade negotiations .  
The negative economic impact on the target State depends on a variety of factors , such as the magnitude and scope of the imposed coercive economic measures , the relative size of the target vis - - vis the sender State ( i.e . , the degree of economic autonomy of the target State ) , and the availability of alternative economic options for the target State in terms of access to markets , capital , technology and investments .  
Major pharmaceutical firms and suppliers of medical equipment and medical equipment spare parts , which had historically maintained trade links with Cuba , recently informed the Cuban authorities officially that since their products either contained United States components or were manufactured under United States technological licences which were affected by the ban imposed by the United States federal authorities , it was impossible to proceed with the deliveries .  
In line with its support for General Assembly resolution 49 / 9 , the Islamic Republic of Iran rejects the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba and considers it a violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , lacking acceptable justification in current international affairs .  
The complete embargo which has been imposed on the people of Iraq for the last five years , depriving the Iraqi people , including women , children and elderly , of their most basic legitimate right , which is the right to life , is not considered as a violation of human rights , since it was the wish of the forces hostile to Iraq , with which Mr . van der Stoel is cooperating .  
That situation is epitomized by the unjust comprehensive embargo that has been imposed on Iraq for almost five years , leaving an inhumane impact on various aspects of life and producing social conditions alien to our society , which adheres to high moral values and is distinct in its security and stability . 
The resolution encompasses dubious political objectives such as deceiving world public opinion in order to eliminate the growing pressure to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and lift the unjust embargo imposed on it in a bid to divert efforts to that end within the Security Council and thus ensuring the continued imposition of the embargo for as long as possible .

The legitimate world-wide concern for social development and environmental protection should not be allowed to degenerate into additional conditionalities imposed on developing countries from abroad .  
Although the Turkish Cypriots now live free from Greek Cypriot harassment , oppression and terror , an inhuman embargo on their political , economic , social and cultural activity , imposed by the other side , continues .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Bulgaria 's space programme had suffered in recent years from the effects of the painful transition from a centrally planned to a free market economy , and the severe economic crisis ; its national economy had also suffered from the strict implementation of sanctions imposed by the Security Council on other countries .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
In that connection , he reiterated that the increase in Iraq 's rate was unjustified since it ignored the country 's economic situation and the adverse consequences of the complete embargo imposed on it by the Security Council , since that embargo had deprived it of any source of income and rendered it unable to respond to the humanitarian and vital needs of the population .  
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , for its part , had paid its assessed contribution up to the end of the current year , despite the difficult economic circumstances it was suffering ; those difficulties , as everyone knew , had been considerably worsened by the consequences of the embargo and unjust sanctions imposed by the Security Council .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
It is already clear today that the conflict imposed on the Tajik people an enormous human tragedy was aimed at undermining the newly emerging foundations of the State and interfering with economic growth and market reforms and hence the country 's independent development along a general democratic course .  
However , that is not because , apart from current financial constraints , the Organization has not allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping operations ; it is because it has not come to grips with the real causes of conflicts , and because artificial solutions have so often been imposed which , far from fostering a negotiated and objective settlement of conflicts , have been dictated by hegemonic interests . 
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
Mwakawago ( United Republic of Tanzania ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegation 's appreciation for the Secretary-General 's report , contained in document A / 51 / 355 dated 13 September 1996 , concerning agenda item 27 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
Seemingly intractable , age-old problems have witnessed dramatic developments , stability and economic development .  As my Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated , the Government of Angola is profoundly concerned by the difficult social and economic situation prevailing in the Republic of Cuba as a result of the financial and economic blockade imposed on that member of the General Assembly .  
Secondly , I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to remind the international community that my country is suffering from an inhuman , illegal and unjust economic blockade imposed by the neighbouring States under a pretext involving my country 's domestic policies a question that has already become nugatory .  
Therefore , any action taken by Israel since the beginning of the Madrid process to alter the political , legal or demographic status of Jerusalem is tantamount to creating a fait accompli to be imposed on the Arab party , which would constitute a judgement on the status of the Holy City before the beginning of the final status negotiations .  This is unacceptable and can not be conducive to the peace we all desire .  
As many United Nations agencies had stated , the impact of the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq was not limited to the frightening number of deaths which it had caused among children , women and the elderly , since in fact an entire generation of Iraqis had been sacrificed as a result of the difficulties they had encountered in terms of education and health and other social spheres .  
With regard to the assets freeze imposed under resolution 883 ( 1993 ) , at its 43rd meeting , on 4 May 1994 , the Committee authorized the Chairman to convey to all States and international organizations its decision by which it stated that the transfer of funds through Libyan blocked accounts for legitimate diplomatic missions and international organizations in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , was , as an exception , permissible in terms of resolution 883 ( 1993 ) .  
While it was true that the current system of 12 hours of meetings daily required overtime payments for the servicing of evening and night meetings , the expenditure thus incurred would remain within the budgetary limits authorized for the period in question because of the restrictions which had been imposed earlier in the session .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
We are addressing ourselves to you , Mr . Secretary-General , in the difficult and critical circumstances in which we find ourselves , in order to assure you once again that we reject and condemn the policy of blockade and closure being pursued by the Government of Israel and to convey to you our extreme displeasure and great concern at the dire consequences the blockade measures are having and at the ongoing closures that have been imposed by Israel on the entire Palestinian people in the areas subject to the Palestinian National Authority . 
The legislation regulating the use of cash exceeding 20-million liras ensured the identification of bank and financial brokers , and imposed upon them the obligation to inform the Questore of all suspicious transactions , without incurring penal and administrative sanctions because their collaboration exonerated them from criminal liability .  
Spanish legislation laid down very useful additional measures for cases in which the offences were committed by organized gangs , as well as increasing the penalty imposed , such as the dissolution of the organization , closure of its premises , temporary suspension of its activities and professional disqualification of its members .  
Such a method of operation may be characterized by widespread use of bribery and favours to ensure the malleability of key positions and agencies ; political funding to ensure that politicians elected to office will be indebted to the criminal organizations ; carefully targeted " payoffs " to law enforcement personnel to provide intelligence ; and the provision of financial incentives to members of the judiciary to ensure that the penalties for criminal activities are either not imposed or are modest .  
The growth of lending was now inhibited by a limited profitability of investment ; the reluctance of banks to take long-term commitments because of risks imposed by uncertainty over future political and economic conditions ; the inability to obtain clear titles to real estate needed for collateral ; and lack of use of chattel mortgages by banks in financing vehicles and equipment .  
As for the alleged emigration of Turkish Cypriots from Northern Cyprus , this is both an exaggeration and the epitome of hypocrisy on the part of the Greek Cypriot side , because the economic and other hardships being faced by the people of Northern Cyprus are the direct result of the inhuman economic , social , cultural and political embargo being imposed on our people by the usurper Greek Cypriot regime in Southern Cyprus .  
I have the honour to inform you that under Article 35 , paragraph 1 , of the Charter of the United Nations , the Government of Burundi has decided to propose the convening of an urgent meeting of the Security Council to discuss the total and illegal economic blockade , which is in all respects contrary to international law , imposed by the States of the Great Lakes Region and the threat of an imminent arms embargo to the very severe detriment of our country and our people .  
Although no substantive intergovernmental or inter-agency discussion on the subject has yet taken place , the recent conceptual analyses and specific case studies have featured several basic principles or criteria for identifying and assessing the special economic problems of States arising from the implementation by them of sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter .  
I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention also to the question of the two no-flight zones which the United States of America and the United Kingdom have imposed on Iraq and which the Iraqi Government has on numerous occasions said are the result of a unilateral act based on the continued use of armed force for the purpose of attacking Iraq 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
On 2 November 1995 , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 10 , entitled " Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba " , in which it requested the Secretary-General , in consultation with the appropriate organs and agencies of the United Nations system , to prepare a report on the implementation of the resolution in the light of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to submit it to the Assembly at its fifty-first session .  
By a letter dated 23 July 1996 ( A / 51 / 226-S / 1996 / 595 ) , the representative of Ukraine transmitted to the Secretary-General an aide-m \ x { 5e66 } oire on the position of Ukraine on the problems of implementation of the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council , in which it is stated , inter alia , that Ukraine has paid a high price for strict and consistent implementation of the sanctions .  
By a note verbale dated 30 August 1996 ( A / 51 / 330-S / 1996 / 721 and Corr . 1 ) , the representative of Bulgaria transmitted to the Secretary-General a national communication on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 50 / 58 E , in which it is pointed out , inter alia , that , by virtue of its geographic location and the outward nature of its economy , Bulgaria has been extremely vulnerable to the negative side effects of the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
The Committee considered that the mandate received from the General Assembly did not require an opinion on bilateral issues between member States , which is why it makes no statement on the specific measures adopted by the Government of the United States of America in relation to Cuba , such as the embargo imposed for over three decades , while nevertheless noting that such measures raise legal questions in the light of the norms established in articles 18 and 19 of the charter of the Organization of American States ;  
The Working Group was established by the Commission in its resolution 1991 / 42 of 5 March 1991 , by which the Commission decided " to create , for a three-year period , a working group composed of five independent experts , with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned " . 
This unprecedented formula of a coordinated , inter-institutional , international cooperative effort to assist States in their observance of mandatory economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council may have been a decisive factor in making these measures a valuable and effective policy instrument in the graduated response to threats to international peace and security in this case .  
The documents also detail the advantages of the Saddam river project in the marsh area , and explain the reasons for the imposition of some of the severe punitive measures of a preventive and temporary nature dictated by the difficult conditions experienced by Iraq as a result of the economic sanctions imposed on it .  
With regard to the proceedings of the National Convention , the main criticisms which have been variously made have centred around , first , the composition of the delegates and the absence of genuine and proper representation of members returned at the general elections ; second , the restrictions imposed upon the delegates and the restrictive procedures which are required to be followed ; and third , the restricted opportunity for meaningful discussion , including the absence of free debate and exchange of ideas .  
It was ironic that , despite the explicit recognition at the World Summit for Social Development that problems of underdevelopment required international cooperation , the utility of international development cooperation was being questioned , development assistance had stagnated or declined , and more and more stringent conditionalities were being imposed under social clauses .  
Further deepening of the development process would require an internationally agreed framework that would facilitate the stable , non-discriminatory and reasonable access of developing countries to technology , on the basis of a more transparent , critical and objective evaluation of the restrictions imposed on the grounds of alleged " dual use " .  
He reported about numerous allegations , the majority of which concerned death sentences imposed after trials by military courts , allegedly falling short of international standards .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
The measures imposed on the Bosnian Serb party were suspended indefinitely starting on 27 February 1996 , after the Security Council was informed the day before , through the appropriate political authorities , that , in the assessment of the commander of the Implementation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bosnian Serb forces had withdrawn from the zones of separation established in the Peace Agreement ( letters to States and international organizations , SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2 ) and SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2-1 ) ) ;  
In reply to the accusations concerning the right to food and adequate health care , his delegation stressed once again that the system for rationing basic products introduced in 1990 because of the economic sanctions imposed against Iraq applied to all Iraqi citizens without exception or discrimination , which the United Nations missions that had travelled to Iraq and several reports by international organizations could confirm .  
Under article R . 645 _ 1 of the Penal Code , a fine of up to 10,000 francs is imposed for publicly wearing a uniform or displaying insignia or emblems resembling those worn by the members of an organization declared criminal by the N \ x { e16c } nberg Tribunal ( SS , Gestapo , SD and Nazi Commander Corps ) or by any person found guilty of crimes against humanity .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
I had specified , however , that this plan was being seriously jeopardized by the total economic embargo imposed against Burundi , and I had stressed the urgent need to lift this embargo to allow our country to participate in this important humanitarian operation in many ways , such as by making available the Bujumbura international airport , the hospitals and modern hotels of the capital , the social centres and other reception facilities , the road networks and , especially , hospital and medical personnel .  
Noting the arduous and difficult conditions in which UNRWA carried out its work to assist Palestinian refugees , he said that , at the regional level , Israel was continuing its occupation and escalating its acts of aggression against the Palestinians , and that it had imposed an economic embargo and a curfew , and had destroyed homes and closed schools .  At the international level , donor Governments had not made their contributions to UNRWA activities , and the new Israeli Government had announced that it was repudiating all the principles of the peace process .  
I am sure it is obvious to all persons living in the south that the economic , social and political isolation imposed upon us has been counter-productive as this treatment has helped us to get stronger on our feet and to find adequate alternatives for self-existence , all of which help to consolidate and give permanence to the division of the island .  
While recognizing the discretionary powers of the courts and tribunals in imposing the penalties prescribed by domestic law for acts of racial discrimination , the Committee had often pointed out that the lightness of the penalties imposed in such cases , some of which had affected the fundamental right to life and physical integrity , was not commensurate with the seriousness of the offences .  
Noting with very deep concern that the total economic blockade imposed against Burundi seriously penalizes the most vulnerable social groups , particularly the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons , the tens of thousands of returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ,  
Makes an impassioned appeal to the United Nations system and to intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to join in providing assistance to those segments of the population most gravely affected by the embargo and whose already grim economic , material and health conditions are being greatly exacerbated by the total blockade imposed against Burundi , namely , displaced persons , returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ;  
Firmly upholds the validity of the principles cited in comparable situations by certain Governments which imposed the embargo against Burundi , namely , that the imposition on a State of an economic , commercial or financial blockade also has adverse consequences for the sovereignty and interests of other countries and that the imposition of one State 's jurisdiction on another State is contrary to the principles of international law ;  
Deeply concerned at the widespread and disastrous consequences of the economic sanctions imposed against Burundi for the national economy , public finances and agricultural production and for the health and the education , at all levels , of its population ,

The Commission decided to set up a working group composed of five independent experts with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the international instruments adopted by the States concerned .  
The mandate contained in resolution 1991 / 42 to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned covers both administrative and judicial detentions and , among the latter , those prior to , during and after trial .  
Mongolia agrees with the conclusion that democracy is not a model to be copied or imposed , but rather a goal to be attained , and that the pace at which democratization can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture or society .  
In another context , and at the level of the private sector , Egyptian businessmen have not held back initiating a number of economic projects with their Palestinian counterparts designed to enhance the efficiency of the Palestinian economy and save it from the consequences of the destructive closures imposed on it at random by Israel .  
For example , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia both reported that several countries in their region expressed strong concerns regarding their problems in the implementation of and compliance with conventions due to the administrative burden imposed , and the lack of institutional and technical capacities and financial resources .  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
The ban on the export of hazardous products , including those intended for recycling , which has now been imposed by the Basel Convention would remain a dead letter if it were not accompanied by practical measures for the detection of illicit practices .  This can be achieved only by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Educated women in the urban areas of northern Afghanistan expressed grave concern over the restrictive measures imposed on women by the Taliban movement , especially in large urban centres which had achieved a certain level of sophistication such as Kabul and Herat , where women have played a prominent role in the culture for centuries .  
The development of future large water-supply systems must adopt pricing that reflects all external costs , including waterlogging ; salinization ; habitat alteration ; impact on endangered species ; long-term deterioration of water quality due to changing land-use practices in catchment areas ; cultural and social dislocation ; and the cost of imposed risks .  
The serious consequences of the sanctions and the embargo imposed on Iraq have aroused widespread international concern in official , political , legal and civic circles .  
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Expressing its grave concern at the enormous human suffering and material damage sustained by the Libyan Arab people and neighbouring peoples as a result of the maintenance of the coercive measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriya under Security Council resolutions 748 ( 1992 ) and 883 ( 1993 ) ,  
Regretting the failure of the three Western countries to respond positively to international and regional endeavours and to the efforts made to devise a settlement based on the principles of international law , in a context of mutual understanding and constructive dialogue , with the result that the Security Council , following its consultations of 14 March 1997 , extended the embargo measures imposed on the Great Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ,  
Decides to renew , for a three-year period , the mandate of the Working Group composed of five independent experts entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned ;  
Much of the populace has accepted Taliban rule not , I would say , because they want a severe judicial regime or social and religious restrictions imposed on all , but because they are desperate for peace and a semblance of normal life .  
Decides to renew , for a three-year period , the mandate of the Working Group composed of five independent experts entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned ;  
The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
Even in situations where it may be necessary to impose limitations on such a right , full compliance with article 4 of the Covenant is required so that any limitations imposed must be determined by law only insofar as this may be compatible with the nature of these [ i.e . economic , social and cultural ] rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society .  
That concern was evoked by the fact that the situation in the occupied territories was growing worse each day , as shown by the total blockade of the territories and the restrictions imposed on freedom of movement , which , in turn , had a catastrophic impact on the economic and social situation , health care , education and freedom of religion . 
The Organization of African Unity has consistently expressed its concern over the continued sanctions imposed on that country , with their humanitarian consequences on the ordinary people , and has called for a fair trial of the suspects according to acceptable requirements of justice and international law .  
The devastation and the destruction , as well as the human tragedy resulting from years and years of unrelenting ethnic hatred , witnessed in the fragmented former Yugoslavia ; the division of Cyprus ; the sanctions imposed by the Security Council on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , which continue to have far-reaching effects on neighbouring countries ; the recent turmoil in Albania ; and political instability in some countries because of rampant extremist fundamentalist elements , these are matters of great concern to all the littoral States of the Mediterranean .  
Instead , it had institutionalized the peaceful settlement of disputes through the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and , in case of armed conflict , had imposed certain limits and duties on the parties at war , down to the level of the individual , in the first genuine attempt by the international community to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .  
In order to develop a shared understanding of the problems and possible solutions , preparations for the formulation of the strategic framework include a comprehensive needs assessment on the impact of the humanitarian tragedy as well as the constraints imposed on the economic , social and developmental prospects for recovery .  
The Government of the Republic of Angola has always opposed the economic blockade , and the trade and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America on the Republic of Cuba , in violation of the principles of international law and , on the several occasions when this question was discussed in international forums , particularly at the United Nations , Angola voted in favour of an unconditional lifting of such blockade , on the basis of a frank and constructive dialogue , for the benefit of the people of both countries .  
A matter of particular concern was that the unregulated use of sanctions had resulted in unnecessary suffering for innocent civilian populations ; sanctions should be imposed only as a last resort , and the proposals for ameliorating the plight of third States must be carefully studied .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
The aim of mine-action programmes , therefore , is not only technical - to survey , mark and eradicate mines - but also humanitarian and developmental - to create an environment in which people can live more safely and in which economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination . 
As public gatherings are considered by individuals and groups as the last remaining alternative means to express publicly differing views and opinions , given the denial of access to Government _ controlled media and the harassment of the independent press , the direct and indirect limitations presently imposed on such events must be considered highly undesirable .  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
Every new charge made by Cuba is supported by more than $ 60-billion in losses and that is not a full assessment by an economy distorted by the war conditions imposed on us , and by the incalculable human , physical and psychological damage we have sustained .  
My country appreciates the enormous efforts made by developed and developing countries alike to address the great challenge of sustainable economic and social development , despite the weighty responsibilities imposed upon them by economic reform .  
The sanctions imposed on Iraq and the foreign interference in its domestic affairs have given rise to clandestine excavations that have enabled their organizers to appropriate and sell cultural property and rare art objects of inestimable value , as well as manuscripts and antique books .  
Whereas : Through the Platt Amendment and its continued intervention and meddling in the internal affairs of the country , the United States of America usurped part of the national territory by installing the Guant \ x { 5ad5 } amo naval base , imposed corrupt and despotic regimes , including the ignominious and bloody tyrannies of Machado and Batista , and since 1959 has systematically attacked Cuba with the declared objective of putting an end to its independence , eliminating Cuban nationality and forcing the population into servitude ,  
The Government of Iraq resorted to the imposition of a tax on travel as a purely administrative and financial measure that was not intended to impede travel by citizens or discriminate between them on political or social grounds ; it was necessitated by the situation brought about by the iniquitous economic embargo imposed on Iraq .  
The country does not have the technical , physical or human resources to manufacture weapons of mass destruction , since its principal concern is to promote its economic development plan and to mitigate the adverse impact that the coercive measures imposed on our people have had on all aspects of life .  
Mr . Al-Humaimidi ( Iraq ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the comments made by the United States representative following the introduction of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq had been motivated by that countrys desire to prevent the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq , despite Iraqs full compliance with the relevant Security Council resolution and contrary to the views of most members of the international community . 
The Committee also notes the major problems experienced as a consequence of the armed conflict , which has imposed serious hardships on the entire population , including heavy casualties , long _ lasting physical , emotional and psychological effects , and the disruption of some basic services .  
The Front ( UINFSA ) calls upon the Taliban to take into serious account the sufferings and miseries of the innocent civilian population in Afghanistan resulting from the protracted imposed war and to declare their readiness through joining a genuine intra-Afghan dialogue aimed at achieving a negotiated settlement , rather than pursuing the dangerous option of continuing war in Afghanistan .  
United Nations agencies should encourage small States to adopt regional approaches , wherever advantageous , with relevant assistance justified in cost-benefit terms and focused on human resources development , environmental activities and reducing the administrative constraints imposed by small size .  
The international community and States should take all the necessary measures to protect the rights of vulnerable segments of the population and give very serious consideration to holding a large _ scale discussion on the practice of embargoes and economic sanctions which are imposed on States and have adverse consequences for the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights of the segments concerned ;  
In that connection , his delegation was deeply concerned that , using the pretext of freedom , democracy or the environment , laws were being promulgated and unilateral restrictions were being imposed which undermined free trade and violated international law and the trading practices negotiated at the multilateral level . 
Despite the severe economic difficulties brought about by the unjust economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , her Government had paid the sum of $ 1.193-million to the Organization during the previous week ; that was a reflection of Cuba 's commitment to the Organization .  
It has done so despite the exceptional circumstances , well known to the international community , that Iraq is experiencing because of the maintenance of the comprehensive embargo imposed on it in August 1990 and because of the brutal military aggression of January 1991 that created highly abnormal conditions in all spheres of civilian life and for all groups of the population .  
He is in a better position than others to know that the harsh conditions imposed on Iraq by a devastating embargo that has entered its eighth year would have destroyed the country 's social structure had it not been for the dedicated commitment of the Government of Iraq to protecting the cohesion of the Iraqi people and safeguarding social and moral values and social solidarity .  
It has not been satisfied with ruining building sites in the occupied Golan since 1967 , including the liberated town of Quneitra , and established in their stead Israeli settlements whose number has gradually increased and risen to 40 settlements inhabited now by about 17,000 Israeli settlers , while suppression is imposed on building throughout the occupied Syrian villages , with heavy taxes imposed on building , which has resulted in an abnormal rise of building prices which is very onerous to the population . 
The Government of Belarus has never employed economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion and does not recognize the validity of any coercive measures or legislative acts of an extraterritorial nature that are imposed by any State on a unilateral basis .  
Since recovering its full independence in 1959 , Cuba has been subjected to all manner of coercive measures , characterized by pressure , threats and hostilities whose stated purpose is to subvert the political , economic and social alternative chosen by the Cuban people in exercise of their sovereignty .  The clearest expression of this increasingly aggressive conduct is the permanent economic , commercial and financial blockade unilaterally imposed against Cuba for almost four decades by the Government of the United States of America , involving an endless list of various types of coercive economic measures .  
Iraq is a developing country that is suffering greatly as a result of the coercive economic policies and measures exemplified in the complete economic embargo imposed on it more than seven years ago that affect the health of the Iraqi people and every aspect of its economic , social and cultural life .  
Further , the humanitarian considerations that the Holy See applies to economic sanctions were articulated by His Eminence Angelo Cardinal Sodano , Secretary of State , who stated that the Holy See hoped that the Security Council would be better informed about the negative effects , on a humanitarian level , deriving from the application of sanctions imposed on a State in strict application of the Charter of the United Nations .  
Although such measures may be imposed not only by individual States , but also by a group of States , the determination or judgement of alleged wrongful or objectionable policies of target States subject to coercive economic measures is made by sender State ( s ) largely on a unilateral or narrow-group basis .  
Where a countrys capacity to develop and implement a comprehensive economic programme has been disrupted by conflict , consideration must be given to relaxing the normally strict financial conditions imposed by international lending institutions .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities are punishable in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties are imposed .  
In conformity with its humanitarian ideal , his Government considered that the human dimension , especially the social , economic and cultural rights of the people , should be taken into account whenever sanctions were imposed .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal [ corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner , and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
Owing to the hard economic pressures created by the comprehensive embargo imposed on Iraq , large numbers of Iraqi women were forced to abandon working life by resigning or retiring from jobs because of fast increasing living costs and inadequate salaries .  
Despite economic hardships exacerbated by the illegal economic , commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America , Cubas Government continued to devote a significant and growing proportion of its budget to social protection programmes .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal [ corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
My Governments pattern of payments clearly reflects its unshakable determination to meet its budgetary obligations despite the extraordinary difficulties it is facing as a result of the rigid , irrational and inhuman economic , commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America on Cuba for more than three long decades .  
It was pointed out , however , that the obligation to operate a CRL might be appropriate for high-value transactions and certificates ( i.e . , for those enhanced electronic signatures that were intended to produce legal effect ) but would be overly burdensome ( and contrary to existing practice ) if it were to be imposed with respect to all certificates ( including cheap certificates used in the context of significant numbers of digital signatures ) .  
Noting with grave concern the content of the report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Organization , [ 5 ] appointed in March 1997 in accordance with article 26 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization , regarding the observance by Myanmar of the Forced Labour Convention , 1930 ( No .  29 ) , which indicates a widespread and systematic use of forced labour imposed by the military on the civilian population ,  
Some consider that the permanent nature of the organization is the source of unacceptable waste at a time when budgetary austerity is being imposed on all countries and at a stage in our economic history which is haunted by the spectre of crisis and unemployment among both poor and rich .  
Affirms , on behalf of the Ethiopian people , that , while Ethiopia shall always be committed , with all the necessary resolve , to principles of international law governing inter-State relations and to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations , it shall , on the other hand , accept no unfair , unjustified or inappropriate restrictions imposed on its right to self-defence , which all self-respecting nations take for granted ;  
The Working Group is composed of five independent experts , with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal [ corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
Iraq , in particular , is suffering from the effects of a disease that is incurring large-scale economic costs in terms of the quantities of red meat and dairy products lost , thereby exacerbating the suffering of many Iraqis already undernourished owing to the maintenance of the unjust embargo imposed on the country .  
Iraq and its people are daily being subjected by the United States and its dependency , the United Kingdom , to heinous acts of international terrorism , inasmuch as the governments of these two countries are maintaining no-flight zones in the national airspace of the Republic of Iraq , as well as to their frantic attempts to interfere in Iraq 's internal affairs and to their insistence on maintaining the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq in 1990 .  
In connection with the other 50 per cent , spare parts for existing medical equipment and new medical equipment have been imported , the importation of these items having been adversely affected by the unjust embargo imposed nearly nine years ago , given that they are to be regarded as integral to the diagnostic process . 
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal [ corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
One of the major problems identified by the Mission was the blockade imposed by the federal authorities on humanitarian assistance entering Montenegro through the port of Bar or from Croatia ( e.g . a large convoy of humanitarian aid including medical supplies destined for internally displaced persons had been blocked by the federal authorities for 10 days inside Montenegro ) .  
It is also considered crucial that the next generation of operational observing systems be designed specifically to meet the more stringent requirements imposed by the need for the detection of climate and global change .  
The secretariat also highlighted the considerable strain imposed on it by high vacancy rates , which were compounded by lengthy procedures for filling posts and restrictive rules on the hiring of temporary staff , but assured delegations that it could and would carry out all the work assigned to it .  
The United States , which has continued to apply laws and measures affecting the sovereignty and legitimate interests of other States and freedom of trade and navigation , as well as inflicting tremendous pain on the Cuban people , should , in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions of the United Nations , put an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo that it has imposed on Cuba .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
That the United States of America continues to ignore the will of the international community , as embodied in the successive resolutions adopted by the General Assembly with a view to lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba , is to be regarded as a flagrant violation of the principles and norms of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations .  
In conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and out of respect for the norms of international law , the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has neither promulgated nor applied any laws of the kind referred to in the relevant paragraph of General Assembly resolution 53 / 4 .  3 .  For more than a decade and a half , the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has been enduring measures imposed upon it by the United States of America that are similar to those being maintained against Cuba .  
On the basis of the foregoing , the Sudan opposes the economic and commercial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , which has caused great damage to the Cuban people and violated its legitimate rights and interests , being a flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations and showing disregard for their lofty and noble principles .  
Venezuela believes that unilateral measures that are extraterritorial and coercive in nature , such as the embargo imposed against Cuba , have a negative effect on the legal regime which defines economic and trade relations between nations and an adverse impact on the efforts that have been carried out in order to achieve economic integration at both the continental and subregional levels .  
The policies and laws of economic , commercial and financial blockade and embargo of the United States of America imposed on the Republic of Cuba in the last decades violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and run counter to the common trends of our world today , namely cooperation for development on the basis of equality amongst sovereign States and non-discrimination of political systems .  
This demonstrates not only the unanimous agreement of the international community on the urgency for the abolition of these obsolete policies , which have been imposed on the Cuban people for so long , but also the common desire for the development of healthy international political relations , the strengthening of international cooperation for the development of all nations , an irreversible trend of the twenty-first century . 
UNICEF has actively publicized its view that it is unacceptable that a clear ban on childrens recruitment has not yet been imposed on the direct and indirect participation in hostilities of children below 18 years of age , regardless of whether they have been forced to join armed forces , or whether they appear to have done so voluntarily ; this applies equally to governmental and non-governmental forces .  
He was held responsible for 11 counts of murder , torture , rape , causing great suffering or serious injury and inhumane acts and a number of concurrent sentences were imposed by the Trial Chamber , the maximum being 20 years ' imprisonment for murder and wilful killing .  
As a representative of a State subjected to an unprecedented humanitarian disaster due to the sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the aggression carried out daily by two permanent Council Members , I launch an appeal to the Council to abandon the double standard and to be true to the role assigned to it in the Charter .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
Anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant market positions limit market access and market entry to major developed country markets ; they include exclusive dealing , market sharing , export restraints imposed on licensees and joint venture partners , and denial of access to international networks and technology markets .  
Those developments had taken place despite the coercive economic sanctions imposed on the Libyan people in the early 1990s , which had caused it enormous losses and had impeded plans and programmes designed to meet the needs of vulnerable groups in society .  
The easier path towards an acceptable definition of aggression would have to recognize limitations imposed by the Charter , as well as practical limitations reflecting the need for the international community to respond to humanitarian and other crises without being harassed or , much worse , being charged with violations of the Statute .  
The representatives of the people of Iraq urge an immediate halt to the daily attacks being carried out by United States and British aircraft under the cloak of the so-called aerial exclusion zones imposed on Iraq without any legal basis , inasmuch as these attacks target civilian and services-related installations such as electric power stations and water treatment plants in such a way as to affect the lives of Iraqis in an adverse manner and inflict harm on them .  
The devastating impact of the war on all aspects of Afghan society is compounded by a combination of poverty , profound underdevelopment , the absence of representative and accountable governance mechanisms and the marginalization of particular groups , including the severe restrictions imposed on the participation of women and girls in public life . 
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Similarly , the rules of the multilateral financial institutions , implicit in the conditionalities of the IMF and the World Bank , which are applicable only to deficit countries or borrowing countries , should be reshaped so that the standardized package of policies , which is inflexible , is not imposed on countries , irrespective of time and space , particularly where some of its elements are not consistent with national development objectives in the long term .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
It was also explained that the words [ six months ] in paragraph 3 ( a ) reflected the view of some delegations that : ( i ) a maximum time-limit should be imposed for the carrying out of a visit / mission beginning at the time of the notification so that a notification was not left without being acted upon ; and ( ii ) a minimum period of prior notification should be required before any mission / visit took place .  
The economic sanctions that the Security Council imposes on a number of countries , usually developing countries , and unilateral coercive measures are significant factors that halt the realization of the right to development , cause material and human losses in the development process and require many years to offset , particularly if such economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council continue for a long and indefinite period of time .  
Those decisions reflected the political and economic interests of those States , as illustrated by the fact that , in February 1990 , the United States Administration imposed restrictions on the fulfilment of contracts for agricultural and industrial shipments which had been concluded with Iraq six months earlier .  
Those measures unquestionably prove that those States not only imposed unilateral sanctions on Iraq in advance of those decided upon by the Security Council of the United Nations but also laid down regulations for the sanctions imposed by the Security Council , as a result of which the application of the sanctions became an ongoing institutionalized process that clearly showed that those States intended to perpetuate the embargo .  
At its forty-seventh session , in resolution 1991 / 42 , the Commission decided to create , for a three-year period , a working group composed of five independent experts , with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with relevant international standards or the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out the revised mandate of the Group , which is to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
All this has had a positive effect on the quality of life in Libyan society , as has the provision of all basic social services , despite the coercive economic sanctions that have been imposed on the people of Libya in 1990 s , caused serious human and material damage and hampered programmes and plans devoted to social development .  
If the political manipulation of human rights continues the selectivity , partiality and double standards ; if economic and social rights are ignored ; if the right to development is disregarded ; if a sectarian and abstract international human rights law is imposed ; and if all human rights are not guaranteed for all human beings conflicts will continue .  
Mr . Mra ( Myanmar ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegations appreciation for the Secretary-Generals report contained in document A 54-259 , dated 18 August 1999 , on agenda item 33 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
In keeping with these positions and on the basis of the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter and universally recognized principles of international law , Mali will this year again associate itself with the Member States calling for the lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States of America .  
The report ( A 54-259 ) of the Secretary-General shows , as have his previous reports on the subject , the destructive results of the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba as a coercive and unilateral measure .  
Since the ultimate objective of these measures is to undermine international peace and security and create political and economic instability in other countries , the Islamic Republic of Iran , like other members of the international community , advocates the removal and elimination of all economic and trade embargoes imposed upon Cuba , and believes that differences between States should be settled in a peaceful manner .  
The continuing sanctions and embargo imposed by the United States Government have posed great difficulties for the Cuban people in their endeavour to achieve economic and social development and reform , thus seriously constraining the Cuban Governments efforts to eradicate poverty and enhance its peoples living standards.Cuban women and children have borne the brunt of the suffering , especially in terms of their health and welfare . 
But we must remember that it is a process : a series of steps which build upon each other so that the final result , which we firmly believe to be achievable , will have come about through gradual , careful and deliberate negotiation and not through imperfect solutions imposed from outside or as a consequence of inherent power imbalances or short-term political expediency .  
Nonetheless , it is also natural , in a democratic international community based on the principles of equitable geographic representation and the sovereign equality of States , that changes to the collective security system be the result of a genuine general agreement , instead of being imposed .  
Since all of these conditions have been met , the illegal , brutal and massive economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by the neighbouring countries should be lifted because the country is on the verge of suffocation and the suffering of innocent people is indescribable ; famine is imminent ; and diseases such as meningitis and cholera are epidemic due to a lack of medication .  
Despite the budgetary constraints imposed by the current international financial crisis , Brazil had already pledged a contribution to the Trust Fund set up to support the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and encouraged other countries to do the same .  
The objective of health policy is to correct the imbalances in the national health system and make health care provision more effective and equitable , taking account of the constraints on choice imposed by the repercussions of demographic pressure and changes , the roles of the participants , and the funding and administration mechanisms for the sector .  
Moreover , in the case of securitization of mortgage loans , an assignment against the consumer-debtor may materially increase the burden of risk imposed on the consumer-debtor ( if , e.g . , the mortgage loan is assigned by the friendly local savings and loans bank to a foreign lender , who may be more aggressive in the collection of the outstanding amounts of the loan or in handling any variable interest rate ) .  
The Basel Convention and the national laws of the countries visited regard the illegal traffic in dangerous waste as a criminal act liable to punishment under criminal law , regardless of any civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on persons found guilty of such trafficking .  
At its forty-seventh session , in resolution 1991-42 , the Commission decided to create , for a three-year period , a working group composed of five independent experts , with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with relevant international standards or the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
Under the new article , if the active subject engages in such conduct habitually ; abuses trust or authority ; uses deception , violence or intimidation ; is an older or younger relative , husband , brother , guardian , caregiver or person responsible for the upbringing of the victim ; or if the victim is a minor , the prison sentence is increased from the maximum medium term ( 5 years ) to any of the longer terms ( 5 years and 1 day to 20 years ) imposed by article 367 .  
Article 17 of the Criminal Code stipulates that persons who act as accessories after the fact for their spouse or legitimate relatives by blood or marriage , throughout the direct and collateral lines up to the second degree , as well as natural parents and children born out of wedlock , shall be exempt from the penalties imposed for concealment , unless they have profited from the effects of the crime or ordinary offence . 
International economic sanctions , particularly when imposed by the Security Council , should be conceived in such a way as to avoid aggravating conditions of extreme poverty in the countries concerned.In particular , they should be compatible with the effective exercise of human rights _ and especially economic , social and cultural rights _ by civilians .  
In its report on part one of the first instalment of F1 claims , the Panel discussed the legal framework within which the claims of Governments and international organizations would be decided by the Commission . 5 ] The discussion covered the law applicable to the category F claims , the procedural and evidentiary requirements imposed on the Claimants and the Panels role in the proceedings . 
In this connection , Ukraine underlines the importance of a more active and practical participation of the international financial institutions in providing additional financial assistance to the affected economies , and reiterates its earlier proposals to that effect , as contained in its position paper on the problems of implementation of the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council ( see A 51-226 , annex-S 1996 595 , annex ) .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
By resolution 1132 ( 1997 ) , adopted on 8 October 1997 , the Security Council , gravely concerned at the continued violence following the military coup of 25 May 1997 and determining that the situation in Sierra Leone constituted a threat to international peace and security in the region , imposed a regime of mandatory sanctions , under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , against Sierra Leone .  
It is instructive to conclude from it that the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba is a unilateral action , whose extraterritorial effects have no validity in public international law .  
My delegation is equally concerned about the illegal and humiliating economic blockade that is being imposed on the Palestinian people , resulting in tremendous suffering and in financial losses amounting to several hundred-million dollars .  
It is a sad and sobering reality that , because of measures imposed or conditions existing in certain countries , women continue to be deprived of basic and fundamental human rights , such as the right to education or the right to gainful employment .
