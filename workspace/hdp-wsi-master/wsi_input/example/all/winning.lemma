The technology of using nitrogen as a protecting gas to stretch monocrystalline silicon , winning the national important invention award , has been transformed by the Semiconductor Factory of Zhejiang University in this zone into an outstanding one among domestic and foreign products of the same class .  Now the annual output of the monocrystalline silicon has reached more than 20 tons , becoming number one in the entire country , and its sales market extends from domestic and South East Asia to many European and American countries .  
We must persist in treating war tasks as our ultimate tasks and firmly establish the thought of " doing military construction for future wars . "  In the construction of headquarters , we must truly put the emphasis on winning local wars under the condition of modern technology , especially high technology .  We must strive to improve our military 's ability in planning and directing military construction as well as in organizing and directing troops in fighting .  
During the discussion , officers and men reviewed the army 's glorious history in fighting the people 's war , defeating the strong by the weak , and defeating the superior by the inferior .  They spoke glowingly of the army 's tremendous achievements in revolutionization , modernization , and regularization and reaffirmed their confidence of winning the regional war under the high-tech condition .  
Guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , ideological and political work has always accompanied the party 's founding , development , maturing , and strengthening ; it has become the fine tradition and political strong point of the CPC members in uniting for struggle , conquering difficulties , and winning victory , and has become the party 's " magic weapon " in gathering together the spiritual force of the Chinese nation .  
Only our Party has these important responsibilities .  Our military is the people 's military under the resolute leadership of the Party . Whether or not the military 's Party organizations are firm and strong , whether or not they can become firm fighting forces and whether or not they can play the role of the " Three Representations " are significant to whether or not we can solve the 2 historical tasks , " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's nature . "  
In the field of service trade in particular , as Hong Kong itself is a WTO member , knowing its rules of game very well , and boasting a flexible management system and rich operational experience in accordance with the international customary practices , it can take the lead in making access to China mainland , helping the mainland enterprises merge with the world , and at the same time winning valuable development opportunities for itself .  
Particularly in the new historical period , our military is implementing a new period of military strategies and principles in a positive way , moving along the road of quality construction and of making the military strong with science and technology , and striving to complete two historical tasks of " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's quality . "  Deep changes are taking place in various aspects of military construction and new people , new events and new trends worthy of being recorded with letters of gold have emerged in large numbers .  
We should , via this centralized positive education and regular education , try to insure that each Party member can , aiming at winning modern wars in the future as required , be self-motivated to learn and use science and technology , love the army and learn military skills , acquire solid mastery of skills and contribute to national defense reinforcement and to army improvement of combat effectiveness ;  
The success of the exercise fully reflected the great achievements of the air force logistics system in seriously implementing Chairman Jiang Zemin 's strategic thinking on strengthening the army through science and technology , persisting in taking as their goal winning a high-tech local war , and actively launching mass science and technology training , closely centering on the focal and difficult points in logistics in actual combat .  
The reflection of knowledge economy and innovative ability in military domain can be seen in the emergence of intellectual weaponry , informationized warfare , and military units that are equipped with digitized equipment .  This is a fact , which proves that the first and earliest application of advanced and new science and technology is in the battlefield .  Therefore , the innovation of military knowledge , the innovation of military science and technology , and the innovation of strategy and operational method are necessary for defeating the enemy and winning the victory .  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .  
We should carry out and implement the Program from the heightened perspective of strategy and the overall situation , should understand at a profound level the important significance of emphasizing the construction of command automation for accelerating our military 's modernization construction and for winning high-tech wars , should strengthen our sense of mission and sense of urgency , should conscientiously follow the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests and current interests are subordinate to future interests , and should improve the construction 's overall effectiveness and benefit .  
To strengthen the awareness of leaders at all levels in leading troops in war , the group army has promoted innovations centered on existing equipment , explored the battle method of winning against the enemy 's superiority under an unfavorable situation ; mastered automated field operation command ; enhanced comprehensive quality of officers and men ;  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
Adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military , improving the competitiveness of winning high-tech wars in the future , loving and devoting oneself to the motherland , making painstaking efforts , officials and soldiers being friendly and loving each other , and maintaining the revolutionary moral integrity and so on are all critical issues that Chairman Jiang has been paying close attention to and has repeatedly laid stress on in recent years .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
As far as the military is concerned , a very important aspect in adhering to the Party 's basic line is to implement of the strategy of building up the military in quality and to consistently conform to the combat strength standard , with comprehensively strengthening the military 's combat force and making sufficient preparations for winning high-tech wars in the future as both the starting point and the end-result of all our work .  
To strengthen ideological and political education is of extremely great significance to upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army , stepping up our army 's revolutionization , modernization and regularization , providing a strong spiritual motive force for " winning in war " , and providing a political guarantee for " being immune to degeneration " .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
In a new historic stage , the construction of the ranks of cadres faces many new cases and new problems , among which is the conspicuous contradiction of the scientific and technological qualities in the ranks of cadres failing to conform to the requirements for constructing our military modernization and for winning regional wars under high-tech conditions .  
The purpose of the " three stresses " education by positive examples conducted at the grass-roots level is to bring into play the role of grass-roots party organizations as fighting bastions and the role of party members as exemplary vanguards , pool together the strength of the vast numbers of officers and men , and provide a strong organizational and ideological safeguards for all-round construction of our grass-roots units and for meeting the requirements of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration " .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate , and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of firepower warfare and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered with by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war with firepower warfare .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
Yang Guihua , a chief petty officer for torpedoes and mines , after making a repeated analysis on the design of the torpedo loading equipment , successfully improved the " rapid torpedo loading method " , shortening the torpedo loading time by 50 minutes and winning precious time for the submarine to produce rapid reaction .  He was highly praised by the Navy 's top brass .  
closely center our efforts around the need to enhance our ability of " winning the war " ; conscientiously summarize the practical experiences of the troops ; and strive to create flexible and diversified methods of operation , intensive and highly efficient methods of training , and scientific and standardized methods of management .  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of fighting with firepower and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war by fighting with firepower .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
Especially when we face the corrosion and influence of false ideas prevailing in society , constant adjustments in the relationships of public interests and the urgent task of preparing for military struggles , we should find an answer to and resolve the historical issues of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " and should have new and more demanding standards for implementation of the " program " and for the strengthening of grassroots construction .  
The rules of the GATS are extremely advantageous to the developed countries that have superiority in qualified personnel , information , and management , and an excess of educational resources , which have opened up their paths for occupying the commanding height for economic development in the 21st century and winning the battle of contending for talented personnel in the world .  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
Over the last two years , the scientific and technological military training has brought about profound changes in the guiding principle , contents , means and methods of military training , as well as in military tactics ; and has played an important role in enhancing the troops ' ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
The training quality will directly affect the implementation of work related to combat readiness .  In giving training guidance , this department persisted in guiding the equipment training practice with scientific and technological achievements , and chanted the slogan of " conducting training with science and technology and doing everything for the sake of winning the battle " during the training .  It also probed into the law governing military training with science and technology in order to seek development in equipment training .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
After viewing the experimental demonstration on management of computer network security conducted by the PLA Security Committee at the Jinan Military Region and after hearing the experiences introduced by various military units , Deputy Chief of General Staff Qian Shugen emphasized that ensuring the network security is by no means a simple issue of security , but is an essential mission to prepare for " winning the war . "  He added that ensuring the network security is a key guarantee for winning the future wars , and therefore maintaining secret means " winning the wars . "  
Only by following leap-forward thinking for development ; building informationalized units while informationalizing our units step by step at the same time ; and raising our country 's strategic deterrent and war deterrent will it be possible to provide reliable guarantee for fighting and winning a future hi-tech war .

They should diligently study what is needed in their jobs , what is needed for their working positions and they should pay special attention to learning high-tech knowledge and military skills that are urgently needed for winning wars in the future in an effort to strengthen their abilities to lead soldiers in fighting modern wars .  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
Facing the challenges of the global military revolution and the rapid development of science and technology , only by incessant knowledge refreshment and quality enhancements can officers meet the requirements of winning future high-technology wars .  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption .

To satisfactorily answer and solve the historical topics of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " in the new situation , our military must construct all grassroots units including " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units into strong fighting groups .  
In promoting the campaign to learn from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in the new century , young military professionals must keep our military 's fundamental duty firmly in mind , vigorously promote and develop the " five-point spirits " of struggling with persistent efforts , create endurable ideological styles and acquire competent qualities for " winning wars " through completing ordinary tasks in grassroots construction , through hard work and hardship and through tests of life or death .

Deputies pledged to carry forward the spirit of incessant struggle advocated by President Jiang , have a high sense of political and historical responsibility , strengthen army building in an all-round way , and score good results in the two historical subjects of " winning the battle " and " never changing color " .  
With a comprehensive and dialectical understanding of these principles , leaders will not forget to be scientific and pursue effectiveness , take initiatives to use the standard of winning wars and scientific standards to examine and measure every campaign that is aimed at reform and innovation in the process of military training through science and technology and ensure that these campaigns are scientific , feasible and able to live through the test of practice .  
In addition , these leaders should pay attention to following scientific rules , and should not stop at existing theories and understandings when considering the objective reality but rather , in light of the need for winning wars , courageously explore unknown fields , deepen military training through science and technology by means of continuous reform and innovation , and make achievements in this process .  
In view of the need for developing military science research in the new century , the " regulations " summarize and draw on the successful experience of our army in military science research , emphasize the need to focus military science research on defense construction , army building , and preparations for military struggles in the new situation , conduct perspective study on the issue of winning a local war under the conditions of modern technology , especially high technology , and thus provide powerful theoretical support for the military 's modernization drive .  
In recent years , leaders of the missile brigade , in order to meet the requirements of future war , have worked hard to master military skills , winning the reputation as the " bellwethers " in scientific and technical drills .  
Insofar as basic tasks are concerned , military scientific research aims at exploring the law of war , the law of directing a war , as well as the law of national defense building and army building and at offering scientific and theoretical guidance for checking a war ; winning a war , or furthering national defense building and army building .  
( 2 ) Implementing a military strategic principle for the new period ; meeting the requirements of " fighting and winning " and " remaining unchanged in nature " ; facing a modernization drive , the world , and the future ; further developing military practice ; and serving national defense building , army building , and a military struggle .  
Through the practice of 10 years , the whole army from top to bottom has formed such an understanding : To fulfill the general requirements of the " five phrases " , it is imperative to advance together with the times , regard " winning the battles " and " having no degeneration in quality " as the objectives and the improvement of the overall quality of officers and soldiers as a focal point , make unremitting efforts in laying foundations , and strive to initiate a new situation for the building of grass-roots units of our army .  
In the era of information warfare , qualified senior personnel will undoubtedly become strategic resources vital to a war 's outcome , and those standing at a " commanding height " as regards qualified personnel are bound to get the upper hand in winning a victory in a war . 
Quite a few crucial members of the team were injured .  The team 's competitors hired formidable foreign players .  Changes in the rules of the game added to the difficulties this team faced in winning the championship .

Therefore , to ensure that our contingent of army cadres is on the mark politically is the top priority for upholding the principle of the party 's absolute leadership over the army , which has a direct bearing on the prosperity or decline and success or failure of the party 's cause , the prolonged peace and stability of the country , and the overall requirement that the army is " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  
lay emphasis on the requirements for stressing political awareness , having a good understanding of science and technology , and doing official duties honestly so that our cadres are " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  In particular , we need to put the political criteria in the first place in order to judge whether our cadres have firm ideal and faith and can seek unity ideologically and politically with the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
The decision further urges them to emulate Wang Wei 's dauntless spirit of not fearing strong enemies , not evading difficulties and dangers , and daring to conquer all enemies , so that they will constantly temper their military style of being heroic and indomitable , making decisive struggle , and winning decisive victory .  This will also enable them to strenuously learn modern knowledge of science and technology , become versed in using the weapons in their hands , and truly raise their ability to defend the country under modern conditions .  
Through this education , we should arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of officers and soldiers of the military to love and serve their motherland and strengthen their convictions in winning wars and eradicating corruption so that they will have the full political enthusiasm and great fighting strength for being ready to carry out the sacred mission given by the Party and the country - - maintaining the territorial unity of the motherland and protecting the sovereignty and dignity of our country .

The military region party committee , maintaining that these personnel should contribute their talents and services to developing ways and means for winning future warfare , decided to turn them into highly proficient military personnel during the course when the armed forces were engaged in science and technology training .  
Thus rational and correct command decisions are bound to unleash powerful capability for a belligerent in winning a war with its existing fighting capacity , even under adverse circumstances .  
For example , a belligerent will have to concentrate forces for a " move " aimed at forcing the enemy to submit to its own will and intention , through releasing a large amount of powerful information .  A belligerent will also have to release information intended to highlight its own strong points and the enemy 's weaknesses , sow discord between the enemy troops , and unleash a psychological attack on the enemy , thus putting psychological pressure on the enemy , weakening the enemy 's will , and " winning a war without fighting " .  
Everyone said that as far as the armed forces are concerned , the most fundamental thing in implementing the spirit of the speech is to resolutely implement the strategic guideline put forward by Chairman Jiang on strengthening the armed forces through science and technology , promote the overall building of the people 's army , make proper preparations for winning partial wars under hi-tech conditions , and make new contributions to defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity , defending the people 's peaceful labor , and preserving world peace .  
Although they are in different places and at different posts , they have one point in common , which is their limitless loyalty to the Party and incomparable love of the people , their resolute practice of the important " three represents " concept , constructing the guideposts of life on the cornerstone of performing meritorious service for the Party and sincerely dedicating themselves to the people , winning the heartfelt admiration of the masses with their first-rate achievements and lofty character , and adding luster to the banner of the Party .  
Under the " macro environment " for comprehensive consultations established by communist China , if our side still only emphasized readiness to conduct all-dimensional consultations with the mainland , we would actually be stuck ; or if we only made some empty remarks about consultations within the framework of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , our side would land ourselves in a quagmire in terms of winning international recognition .  
He said : Beijing Municipality will certainly live up to the ardent hopes of the party central leadership and the entire people throughout the country .  With the winning of the bid as a driving force , with " new Beijing , new Olympic Games " as the main theme , we shall seize the great opportunity to advance reform , opening-up , and modernization in Beijing and show the whole world a new look of Beijing .  
The degree of wild celebration and emotional reactions by the Chinese both at home and abroad to Beijing 's successful bid as seen on television and in news photos over the past several days is no less than those several major events since the founding of the People 's Republic , say , the successful explosion of the atomic and hydrogen bombs , the launch of a satellite into space , and China winning the first Olympic medal .

Even after winning their political independence , developing countries were still unable to achieve economic independence and an equal position in the international market ; as a result , the irrational North-South relationship has formed in which countries in the North have economically ( also politically to a considerable extent ) controlled and exploited developing countries in the South , the North has become increasingly rich , and the South increasingly poor .  
It is understood that in the view of the top Chinese leadership , the core of the " three represents " thinking ( the CPC represents the developing needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people ) lies in : Demanding the CPC continue preserving its advanced nature , winning popular support , and maintaining and consolidating its position as a ruling party under the new historical conditions .

It is conceivable that the series of matters on international human rights that were given assurance in Chen Shui-bian 's inaugural speech will surely bring forth unprecedented warm relations between them and international anti-China forces and human rights organizations , and lead to international human rights organization conducting activities in Taiwan " legally , " thereby winning direct and indirectly new support and protection for " Taiwan independence . "  
Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
It is necessary to thoroughly understand the new and higher demands set by the " three represents " on the building the armed forces ideologically and politically .  It is necessary to further emancipate the mind , update concepts , courageously blaze new trails , and strive to make ideological and political work more lively , solid and effective in light of the new situation and tasks in order to provide a powerful spiritual motive force and a reliable political guarantee for " winning victories " and " preventing degeneration .

Only our Party has these important responsibilities .  Our military is the people 's military under the resolute leadership of the Party . Whether or not the military 's Party organizations are firm and strong , whether or not they can become firm fighting forces and whether or not they can play the role of the " Three Representations " are significant to whether or not we can solve the 2 historical tasks , " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's nature .

Particularly in the new historical period , our military is implementing a new period of military strategies and principles in a positive way , moving along the road of quality construction and of making the military strong with science and technology , and striving to complete two historical tasks of " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's quality . "  Deep changes are taking place in various aspects of military construction and new people , new events and new trends worthy of being recorded with letters of gold have emerged in large numbers .

The reflection of knowledge economy and innovative ability in military domain can be seen in the emergence of intellectual weaponry , informationized warfare , and military units that are equipped with digitized equipment .  This is a fact , which proves that the first and earliest application of advanced and new science and technology is in the battlefield .  Therefore , the innovation of military knowledge , the innovation of military science and technology , and the innovation of strategy and operational method are necessary for defeating the enemy and winning the victory .  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .

In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
Adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military , improving the competitiveness of winning high-tech wars in the future , loving and devoting oneself to the motherland , making painstaking efforts , officials and soldiers being friendly and loving each other , and maintaining the revolutionary moral integrity and so on are all critical issues that Chairman Jiang has been paying close attention to and has repeatedly laid stress on in recent years .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
As far as the military is concerned , a very important aspect in adhering to the Party 's basic line is to implement of the strategy of building up the military in quality and to consistently conform to the combat strength standard , with comprehensively strengthening the military 's combat force and making sufficient preparations for winning high-tech wars in the future as both the starting point and the end-result of all our work .  
To strengthen ideological and political education is of extremely great significance to upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army , stepping up our army 's revolutionization , modernization and regularization , providing a strong spiritual motive force for " winning in war " , and providing a political guarantee for " being immune to degeneration " .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
In a new historic stage , the construction of the ranks of cadres faces many new cases and new problems , among which is the conspicuous contradiction of the scientific and technological qualities in the ranks of cadres failing to conform to the requirements for constructing our military modernization and for winning regional wars under high-tech conditions .  
The purpose of the " three stresses " education by positive examples conducted at the grass-roots level is to bring into play the role of grass-roots party organizations as fighting bastions and the role of party members as exemplary vanguards , pool together the strength of the vast numbers of officers and men , and provide a strong organizational and ideological safeguards for all-round construction of our grass-roots units and for meeting the requirements of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration " .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate , and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of firepower warfare and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered with by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war with firepower warfare .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
Yang Guihua , a chief petty officer for torpedoes and mines , after making a repeated analysis on the design of the torpedo loading equipment , successfully improved the " rapid torpedo loading method " , shortening the torpedo loading time by 50 minutes and winning precious time for the submarine to produce rapid reaction .  He was highly praised by the Navy 's top brass .  
closely center our efforts around the need to enhance our ability of " winning the war " ; conscientiously summarize the practical experiences of the troops ; and strive to create flexible and diversified methods of operation , intensive and highly efficient methods of training , and scientific and standardized methods of management .  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of fighting with firepower and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war by fighting with firepower .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
Especially when we face the corrosion and influence of false ideas prevailing in society , constant adjustments in the relationships of public interests and the urgent task of preparing for military struggles , we should find an answer to and resolve the historical issues of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " and should have new and more demanding standards for implementation of the " program " and for the strengthening of grassroots construction .  
The rules of the GATS are extremely advantageous to the developed countries that have superiority in qualified personnel , information , and management , and an excess of educational resources , which have opened up their paths for occupying the commanding height for economic development in the 21st century and winning the battle of contending for talented personnel in the world .  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
Over the last two years , the scientific and technological military training has brought about profound changes in the guiding principle , contents , means and methods of military training , as well as in military tactics ; and has played an important role in enhancing the troops ' ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
The training quality will directly affect the implementation of work related to combat readiness .  In giving training guidance , this department persisted in guiding the equipment training practice with scientific and technological achievements , and chanted the slogan of " conducting training with science and technology and doing everything for the sake of winning the battle " during the training .  It also probed into the law governing military training with science and technology in order to seek development in equipment training .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
After viewing the experimental demonstration on management of computer network security conducted by the PLA Security Committee at the Jinan Military Region and after hearing the experiences introduced by various military units , Deputy Chief of General Staff Qian Shugen emphasized that ensuring the network security is by no means a simple issue of security , but is an essential mission to prepare for " winning the war . "  He added that ensuring the network security is a key guarantee for winning the future wars , and therefore maintaining secret means " winning the wars . "  
Only by following leap-forward thinking for development ; building informationalized units while informationalizing our units step by step at the same time ; and raising our country 's strategic deterrent and war deterrent will it be possible to provide reliable guarantee for fighting and winning a future hi-tech war .  
Therefore , they should accord to the requirements for specialized knowledge and skills of cadres , choose correct majors and courses and scientifically arrange their curricular activities .  They should diligently study what is needed in their jobs , what is needed for their working positions and they should pay special attention to learning high-tech knowledge and military skills that are urgently needed for winning wars in the future in an effort to strengthen their abilities to lead soldiers in fighting modern wars .  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
Facing the challenges of the global military revolution and the rapid development of science and technology , only by incessant knowledge refreshment and quality enhancements can officers meet the requirements of winning future high-technology wars .  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption . "  The military should be ready for military struggles with the military strategic principle in the new period as the guideline , profoundly study characteristics and rules regarding not only the military administration in the new situation but also high-tech regional wars , improve leadership skills and devote efforts to solid implementation .  
To satisfactorily answer and solve the historical topics of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " in the new situation , our military must construct all grassroots units including " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units into strong fighting groups .  
In promoting the campaign to learn from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in the new century , young military professionals must keep our military 's fundamental duty firmly in mind , vigorously promote and develop the " five-point spirits " of struggling with persistent efforts , create endurable ideological styles and acquire competent qualities for " winning wars " through completing ordinary tasks in grassroots construction , through hard work and hardship and through tests of life or death .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
Deputies pledged to carry forward the spirit of incessant struggle advocated by President Jiang , have a high sense of political and historical responsibility , strengthen army building in an all-round way , and score good results in the two historical subjects of " winning the battle " and " never changing color " .  
With a comprehensive and dialectical understanding of these principles , leaders will not forget to be scientific and pursue effectiveness , take initiatives to use the standard of winning wars and scientific standards to examine and measure every campaign that is aimed at reform and innovation in the process of military training through science and technology and ensure that these campaigns are scientific , feasible and able to live through the test of practice .  
In addition , these leaders should pay attention to following scientific rules , and should not stop at existing theories and understandings when considering the objective reality but rather , in light of the need for winning wars , courageously explore unknown fields , deepen military training through science and technology by means of continuous reform and innovation , and make achievements in this process .  
In view of the need for developing military science research in the new century , the " regulations " summarize and draw on the successful experience of our army in military science research , emphasize the need to focus military science research on defense construction , army building , and preparations for military struggles in the new situation , conduct perspective study on the issue of winning a local war under the conditions of modern technology , especially high technology , and thus provide powerful theoretical support for the military 's modernization drive .  
In recent years , leaders of the missile brigade , in order to meet the requirements of future war , have worked hard to master military skills , winning the reputation as the " bellwethers " in scientific and technical drills .  
Insofar as basic tasks are concerned , military scientific research aims at exploring the law of war , the law of directing a war , as well as the law of national defense building and army building and at offering scientific and theoretical guidance for checking a war ; winning a war , or furthering national defense building and army building .  
( 2 ) Implementing a military strategic principle for the new period ; meeting the requirements of " fighting and winning " and " remaining unchanged in nature " ; facing a modernization drive , the world , and the future ; further developing military practice ; and serving national defense building , army building , and a military struggle .  
Through the practice of 10 years , the whole army from top to bottom has formed such an understanding : To fulfill the general requirements of the " five phrases " , it is imperative to advance together with the times , regard " winning the battles " and " having no degeneration in quality " as the objectives and the improvement of the overall quality of officers and soldiers as a focal point , make unremitting efforts in laying foundations , and strive to initiate a new situation for the building of grass-roots units of our army .  
In the era of information warfare , qualified senior personnel will undoubtedly become strategic resources vital to a war 's outcome , and those standing at a " commanding height " as regards qualified personnel are bound to get the upper hand in winning a victory in a war . 
Quite a few crucial members of the team were injured .  The team 's competitors hired formidable foreign players .  Changes in the rules of the game added to the difficulties this team faced in winning the championship .  
They should unite more closely around the party CentralCommittee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner ofDeng Xiaoping Theory , seriously implement the important thinking of " threerepresents , " strengthen the party building and improve the ideological andpolitical levels of the military , and provide a powerful spiritual motivationand reliable political guarantee for " winning in wars " and " neverdegenerating . "  
We are determined to bear in mind Chairman Jiang 's instructions , carry forward Wang Wei 's spirit of fearing no sacrifice and dedicating ourselves to the motherland 's interests , continue to enhance the revolutionary character of the troops , quicken the pace of modernization and regularization , work hard to practice and master military skills , guarantee the winning of the future war , and guarantee that the character of the armed forces will never change .  
Therefore , to ensure that our contingent of army cadres is on the mark politically is the top priority for upholding the principle of the party 's absolute leadership over the army , which has a direct bearing on the prosperity or decline and success or failure of the party 's cause , the prolonged peace and stability of the country , and the overall requirement that the army is " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  
lay emphasis on the requirements for stressing political awareness , having a good understanding of science and technology , and doing official duties honestly so that our cadres are " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  In particular , we need to put the political criteria in the first place in order to judge whether our cadres have firm ideal and faith and can seek unity ideologically and politically with the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
The decision further urges them to emulate Wang Wei 's dauntless spirit of not fearing strong enemies , not evading difficulties and dangers , and daring to conquer all enemies , so that they will constantly temper their military style of being heroic and indomitable , making decisive struggle , and winning decisive victory .  This will also enable them to strenuously learn modern knowledge of science and technology , become versed in using the weapons in their hands , and truly raise their ability to defend the country under modern conditions .  
Through this education , we should arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of officers and soldiers of the military to love and serve their motherland and strengthen their convictions in winning wars and eradicating corruption so that they will have the full political enthusiasm and great fighting strength for being ready to carry out the sacred mission given by the Party and the country - - maintaining the territorial unity of the motherland and protecting the sovereignty and dignity of our country .  
By building a search and rescue center marked by a sound organization structure , flexible command decision-making , advanced search and rescue equipment , and high-quality search and rescue personnel , we will be able to provide strong support for fighting and winning a future war .  
In early 1999 , the PLA general departments decided to build through three stages and within three years this innovation project by following the train of thought for work : Ensuring unified leadership , formulating advance theories , testing results through practice , working out plans at the top level , and simultaneously building all arms and services , with an eye on introducing a new system of training content in light of the requirements for fighting and winning a local war under hi-tech conditions .
