Within our region my country took an active part in drawing up the presidential statement on a commitment to democracy , signed by the Heads of State of the members of the Southern Cone Common Market ( MERCOSUR ) , together with Chile and Bolivia , which established that the full and effective functioning of democratic institutions was an essential condition for cooperation in MERCOSUR . 
It is beyond all doubt that a consistent implementation of all articles of the Dayton Agreement is crucial to the prospects for a normally functioning , democratic State capable of ensuring the basic social , legal , security and other conditions for everybody .  
Moreover , mention should be made of two key issues which have a decisive influence on the human rights situation in Guatemala : the values , attitudes and social behaviours that go to create the overall context in human rights violations take place and are encouraged and tolerant ; and the main characteristics of the functioning of the State institutions responsible for protecting human rights . 
The establishment and functioning of the Commission on the Strengthening of the Justice System should provide the country with a historic opportunity to undertake , based on a broad debate , a judicial reform that meets society 's tremendous need for an independent , professionally sound justice system which can restore public confidence .  
Underlines the responsibility of the parties to cooperate fully and in good faith in the prompt formation and functioning of all the new common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in establishing the necessary conditions for holding democratic , free and fair democratic local elections in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Agreement ;  
This should include appropriate delegation of authority , enhancement of the capacity of the staff through training and the provision of a stable resource base to ensure the continuous presence of an institutional critical mass .

Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
In most cases , the Committee determined that merely to report the adoption of urgent security measures ( implying severe restrictions on the functioning of institutions and the exercise of human rights ) , on the ground of the alleged existence of a state of emergency , was not sufficient , in conformity with the terms of article 4 of the Covenant , to invoke the right of derogation provided for in strictly defined cases .  
The most valuable lesson that can be drawn from the practice of the international monitoring bodies and from the Special Rapporteur 's own experience is the certainty that , to the extent that the norms and principles governing the state of emergency are respected , its impact on the functioning of the institutions , the validity of the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights will necessarily be limited and compatible with a democratic system of government .  
Human rights , as a code of values juridically accepted at the international level , can legitimately signal the ethically acceptable or unacceptable limits of economic policy measures and economic functioning .  
Many of the overall civilian implementation tasks coordinated by my Office , such as the building of common institutions , supporting economic reconstruction , creating communications and transport links between the entities , and providing a basis for a functioning civil society are fundamental to creating the necessary conditions for the return of displaced persons and refugees .  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .

These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
Difficult and painful reform lies ahead if Albania is to succeed in fostering political and social reconciliation , economic development , consolidation of a fully functioning and independent judiciary and electronic media , and the creation of active civil-society institutions .  
It was stated that numerous human rights violations stemmed from the absence of a functioning State system , including social development programmes and a national treasury to pay the salaries of civil servants .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
Planning was carried out on the assumption that the mandate of the force , whether a multinational force or a peacekeeping operation , would be to secure the airport and ensure its functioning as a neutral zone ; to assist in the maintenance and consolidation of a ceasefire ; to create conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance ; and to facilitate political reconciliation leading to the creation of an environment conducive to a peaceful settlement of the conflict through the conduct of elections .  
In paragraphs 20 and 21 of resolution 1997 / 66 , the Commission requested the Special Representative " to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate " and to report on these matters to the upcoming sessions of the Assembly and Commission .

This being the situation , delegations and groups of delegations have to be accommodating to the extent possible so as to facilitate the efficient and meaningful functioning of the Conference , bearing in mind that it has a responsibility towards the entire international community , which is a task well beyond serving the national interests of the Conference 's membership .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,

The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
Respect for human rights is achieved not only through the functioning of instruments to monitor compliance with international treaties but also through political , social and economic measures that allow human rights to become an integral part of social development and a part of the everyday life of each individual .  
The experience gained from the functioning of these two ad hoc tribunals has paved the way for the wider acceptance of the idea of an international criminal court , thus creating a firm legal basis at the universal level for the establishment of individual criminal responsibility with regard to war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
In the debate at this session on proposals for reforming the United Nations , I would like , at the outset , to state that the strategic objective of all of the reforms envisaged must be to provide better conditions for the proper functioning of the Organization so that it can fulfil its founders ' dream of a lasting , democratic , responsible and credible Organization .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
We hope that the OSCE mission in Bosnia will continue to work in close contact with relevant United Nations structures and specialized agencies in resolving such vital matters as protection of the rights of ethnic minorities , the problems of refugees , and the normal functioning of municipal authorities .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
In the law enforcement sector , UNDCP supported operational and investigative training , providing selected equipment to law enforcement agencies and assisting in establishing and improving the functioning of national drug control coordinating bodies , particularly in Brazil , Cuba and Ecuador and in other countries in Central America and the Caribbean .  
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .  
As you may be aware , the agreements on Hebron do not only refer to the redeployment of Israeli military forces in the city , but also to agreed security arrangements , joint security measures , the deployment of the Palestinian police and various civilian matters relating to the normal and effective functioning of the city , and the Israeli and Palestinian populations therein .  
What developing country Governments need to bear in mind is that in order to improve the productivity of investment in developing countries , it is of particular importance to improve the functioning of the capital market through institutional innovation , better regulation of the banking sector , supporting credit programmes targeted at specific groups , and increasing the supply of venture capital .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Considering , in particular , that in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency the major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
Even in some low-income countries that are pursuing sound policies , their low level of development - characterized by structural rigidities , weak institutions and administration , poorly functioning markets and deficiencies in skills and infrastructure - have prevented a rapid and strong response to reform efforts , which may delay the provision of relief under the initiative . 
Reaffirms that the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls upon members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine , as a matter of priority , options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
The emphasis by the CSD " that for all developing countries to benefit more fully from trade liberalization , the achievement of other objectives identified in Agenda 21 , particularly better functioning of commodity markets , increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in developing countries and financial assistance , including debt relief , are important " 6 continues to be relevant to policy efforts .

Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
It was suggested that since the interrelationship between the Sixth Committee and the Commission was a vital component of the functioning of the Commission which must be improved and rendered more effective , the input from the Sixth Committee should therefore be as constructive as possible , whether through responses to questionnaires , through written comments by Governments or through oral comments during the debates on the Commission 's annual report .  
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
Pointing to the danger that the High-level Working Group could take decisions which were actually contrary to those adopted by the General Assembly , she proposed that all administrative and budgetary questions currently addressed by the High-level Working Group , including the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations and human resources management , should be considered by the Fifth Committee during the resumed fifty-first session .  
This includes , inter alia , the right , individually and in association with others , to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs , criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work which may hinder or impede the promotion , protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi _ party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative Government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;

We are also grateful to the entire international community for rendering invaluable assistance to Tajikistan at the critical stage of the formation of its statehood and of the foundations for the normal functioning of civilian society .  
This endeavour is inseparable from the work of defending human rights , whose ultimate purpose is the smooth functioning of civil society and the exercise of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
This includes , inter alia , the right , individually and in association with others , to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion , protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In that connection , he raised the issue of due recognition of such associations by the States concerned , based on an agreed set of rules designed , inter alia , to ensure their democratic functioning , transparency and , thus , overall credibility and legitimacy .  
It has been aggravated by a number of negative social phenomena , such as the deterioration in the health of poor people due to poor nutrition , school leaving caused by a disruption in the normal functioning of educational and cultural establishments , and an increase in crime , and in the moral decay of adults , resulting in more and various forms of violence .  
The Commission could urge relevant institutions , whether national , regional or global , to enhance collaboration with each other , taking into account their respective mandates , with a view to promoting coordinated approaches , avoiding duplication of effort , enhancing effective functioning of existing organizations , and ensuring better access to information and broadening its dissemination .  
Articles 212 and 213 of the Constitution stipulate that the armed forces are obedient , professional and non-political , and shall not deliberate in matters of service , and that their structure , legal regime , doctrine , composition and functioning are defined by the law , regulations and special provisions which the President of the Republic may adopt .  
The Economic and Social Council now holds a series of high-level segments , with ministerial participation , requiring the General Service staff to be involved in providing extensive technical services to ensure the smooth running and efficient functioning of those meetings .  
In this connection , MINURCA is assuring the opposition that the international electoral observers to be deployed starting next month ( see paras . 14 and 15 below ) will also pay close attention to the functioning of CEMI at the local level to ensure the impartiality of the local chairmen .  
As the impact of the international economic environment upon the attainment of social development goals have been recognized by the international community , mutually agreed and coordinated measures to improve the functioning of the world economy have distinct social connotations .  
Assessment conducted last year for the 1998 triennial policy review on the formulation and implementation of the country strategy note and the preliminary assessment of the UNDAF process have shown that the essential precondition for the successful implementation of these instruments and thus of effective field-level coordination is well functioning , highly participatory and active country teams .

Takes note of the efforts already made to strengthen field-level coordination and the role of the resident coordinator system , and encourages further steps towards greater collaboration , at the field level , by ensuring well _ functioning , highly participatory and active country teams , and full consultation with the Governments concerned , while respecting the specific identities and mandates of United Nations operational activities ;  
The pursuit of sound , growth-oriented macroeconomic policies , moreover , needs to be complemented by a general social , legal and political environment conducive to the efficient functioning of markets and , in particular , to the development of the private sector , whose investment decisions are at the centre of growth .  
The economic benefits of privatization consisted of improving enterprise efficiency and performance ; developing competitive industry ; accessing capital , know-how and markets ; achieving effective corporate governance ; developing well _ functioning capital markets ; and securing an optional sale price .

The future of the University is strongly tied to the political and financial support reflected not only in greater numbers of Governments acceding to the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace but also in increasing contributions of financial resources for the normal functioning of the University and the launching of new programmes .  
The Security Council should make every effort to ensure compliance with the two existing ad hoc tribunals , and , pending what we hope will soon be the establishment of a functioning International Criminal Court , the Council must stand ready to endorse the creation of further interim international arrangements to make it possible those responsible for war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide to be held accountable . 
A total of $ 9.7-million has been received ( from Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Norway , Spain , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ) ; however , $ 38-million is still required to raise to a basic minimum standard the functioning and efficiency of the local police forces .  
It has established regular meetings with the Ministers of Justice in both entities to ensure that political , technical and institutional impediments to the proper functioning of the judiciary are being positively addressed .  
These problems , which are linked to the inefficient functioning of the criminal justice system , are compounded by the lack of human resources , the dilapidated state of the courts , and the lack of means of communication , electricity , vehicles and office supplies , and in some cases of codes of judicial procedure .  
They also stressed the importance of sound domestic policies , private capital flows and appropriate functioning of markets , as well as a favourable and open international economic environment , to overcome this crisis and reverse the marginalization of some developing countries , in particular the least developed ones .  
As local institutions , including the court system , have for all practical purposes ceased to function , with the Indonesian civil service , police service , judges , prosecutors and other members of the legal profession having left the territory , the Transitional Administration will be entrusted with the task of rebuilding a structure of governance and administration capable of providing basic public services and a fully functioning administration of justice .

Increasing globalization had posed a serious challenge to the attainment of the goal of full employment ; the global employment problem was further compounded by neo-liberal views which suggested that economic liberalization in its purest form was vital for growth and prosperity worldwide and which saw attempts to regulate labour markets and promote core labour standards as essentially distortionary and impeding the efficient functioning of markets . 
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;

It will be necessary in future to support constructive contacts between the OSCE mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the relevant United Nations structures in carrying out such vital tasks as safeguarding the rights of minorities , resolving the problem of refugees and ensuring the effective functioning of the federal and municipal authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
The third specific characteristic of the current efforts for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the creation and functioning of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe , which has , in the five months of its existence , completed the important evolution from political declaration to operational international mechanism .  
While , because of the provisions written into the Charter , it may not be possible to eliminate the veto , the General Assembly , after witnessing for more than half a century initiatives for peace and security being stifled time and again by the use of veto , can not be expected to create additional obstacles to the effective functioning of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security by adding to the number of veto-wielding countries .  
The Commission urges relevant institutions , whether national , regional or global , to enhance collaboration with each other , taking into account their respective mandates , with a view to promoting coordinated approaches , avoiding duplication of effort , enhancing effective functioning of existing organizations , and ensuring better access to information and broadening its dissemination .  
The enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is hindered by the absence of the rule of law , the existence in Nigeria of military governments , the suspension of the Constitution in favour of rule by military decree and the concomitant resort to intimidation , and the negative effects of widespread corruption on the functioning of governmental institutions .  
He was concerned that persons from the countries directly involved might be assigned to such posts , and believed that only persons from neutral countries should be assigned to the new civil affairs unit to ensure the efficient , effective and impartial functioning of the Mission .  
With regard to the improvement in the functioning of the Unit in the context of shared responsibility , as laid down in General Assembly resolution 50-233 , he said that in that resolution the General Assembly had encouraged the Unit to continue to take the necessary steps to achieve a punctual and systematic follow-up of its recommendations as approved by the legislative organs of participating organizations .  
The circulation of press organs is not authorized , permission is not given for the functioning of new non _ governmental human rights organizations , which have been waiting for years to be recognized , the movements of the population within the country are controlled by military checkpoints , there is oppressive supervision of all private activity and in practice political dissent is viewed almost as a crime , particularly by the peripheral authorities of the mainland region .  
Since the sixth session of the Commission , a functioning prototype of the system has been developed , consisting of a revised international site and a demonstration national node , and mock-ups of regional and institutional nodes .

The global market environment poses enormous challenges , and there is an urgent need for supportive international policies that will ensure the financial systems efficient functioning .
