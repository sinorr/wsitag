Officers and soldiers of the detachment had undergone several weeks of training in port and along the coast .  They also had undergone simulated attack training scores of times .  Their training programs included radar searches , transmitting target parameters , preparing for missile attacks , and making command decisions .  Their reaction time has continuously shortened .  The operational skills of relevant personnel have been greatly improved .  All these factors have laid a foundation for the detachment in successfully using missiles to attack mobile target ships that can change speed and direction .  
The officers and men of the rescue regiment began by studying actual international submarine rescue efforts in recent years , mobilized officers and men , organs , and key divers to conduct in-depth research at submarine forces to familiarize themselves with submarine structures and features , envisage various possible submarine accidents , formulate draft rescue plans directed at different situations and different sea areas , and conduct repeat training from the port to the sea and from above to below the water so as to continuously raise the troops ' rapid response capability in dealing with submarine accidents .  
Then , under Helen 's command , the US special mixed fleet turned and fled toward the open waters .  In 1996 , when the PLA conducted a military exercise including test-firing its guided missiles , the United States also sent aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait . After the PLA 's nuclear submarines departed from their military port and disappeared in the vast seas , the US aircraft carriers immediately left the region .  
Thus , although a formation of U.S . aircraft carriers had shown up more than 100 nautical miles east of Taiwan to make its military presence known during our army 's military exercises in 1996 , it had not actually sailed into the Taiwan Straits . Moreover , as soon as the U.S . forces learned that a number of Chinese nuclear submarines had lifted anchor and left the port , the aircraft carrier battle group immediately moved back 100 nautical miles .

When the Five-Starred flag rose up slowly on both banks of the Victoria Harbor three years ago , people were filled with great joy , yet there was still a faint trace of worry on their mind : After Hong Kong returns to socialist China , will this " free port " be able to retain its original vigor and appeal , and will it continue to enjoy prosperity and stability ?  
Kok said the excellent mutually-beneficial cooperative relations between the Netherlands and China have not only realized in the traditional economic and trade relations but also expanded to science , technology , environmental protection , agriculture , water conservancy , port construction , and to others .  
Such a cooperation is not only reflected in traditional trade and economic relations but has also been extended to scientific and technological , environmental protection , agricultural , water conservancy , port construction , and other fields .  
A few days ago , at a certain sea port in northern Jiangsu , more than 30 civilian ships of large tonnage called up by the Jiangsu Provincial Military District carried officers and men of a certain motorized infantry brigade and heavy equipment and sailed towards the wavy Huang Hai sea area to start a two-day , two-night sea-crossing and military tactics and technology training .  
Upon receiving an emergency order , the naval training vessel " Shichang " set sail in a thick fog with visibility of only 15 m .  It braved the wind and the waves of a near Force 10 typhoon for 17 days , sailing 4000 nautical miles .  It satisfactorily completed comprehensive training in maritime national defense mobilization with " wartime civilian vessels emergency mobilization and acquisition " as its main task .  The vessel returned to a certain military port in the Bo Hai a few days ago .  
In addition to the three countries ' favorable geographical locations and good port facilities at the Baltic Sea , as West European enterprises have joined in developing China 's west regions , such cooperation has a bright future .  
Many local residents drove several hundred miles [ as received ] from Seattle to Everett port to view the Chinese Navy , and there were long lines of cars waiting outside the port and a great throng of people inside ; the US Navy was continually operating more vehicles to carry the passengers , but was unable to meet the demand .  Ms .  
Grasping development as the main theme , Tianjin has three great historic tasks to fulfill at the start of the new century : to build a modern international port city and a major economic center of north China ; to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economy structure ; and to become one of the regions in the lead in basically achieving modernization .  
After its return to the motherland , Hong Kong will retain the status of a free port and an international financial , trade and shipping centre while continuing to maintain and develop its economic and cultural relations with other countries , regions and relevant international organisations so that this international economic metropolis will forever be vigorous and dynamic .  
Its advantageous geographical location , its free port policy of complete openness , its well-developed legal system and highly efficient team of civil service , and its effective economic management and civic administration have all facilitated Hong Kong 's economic development .

Officiating at the ceremony , Chairman of the Provisional Urban Council 's Entertainment Select Committee , Ms Christina Ting Yuk-chee said , " A hundred years ago , Hong Kong was a small fishing port .  Today it has developed into a reputable metropolitan in the world .  Such tremendous success was accomplished because of the great zeal and perseverance of Hong Kong people , their shrewdness in making use of the opportunities , their remarkable adaptability to changing environment and their profound creativity .  
We have one of the best ports , airports and mass transit systems in the world .  We have some of the world 's most efficient and cost-effective communication systems and one of the highest concentration of mobile telephones .  We have invested one-fifth of our annual budget in education to ensure the supply of high quality manpower needed for our continuous economic growth .  We have a rich and diversified cultural heritage , a bilingual open society and a free port .  
Noting that the total door-to-door cost of transporting cargoes through Hong Kong versus Shenzhen is narrowing , Mr Lin stressed that Hong Kong 's free port status , simple , speedy and reliable customs clearance system , as well as competitive and predictable costs are very important reasons for shippers to choose it as the loading port . 
He added that Hong Kong 's traditional strengths have contributed to the positive outlook of our e-business development .  These include an excellent business environment , world-renowned physical infrastructure such as the port and the airport , an open market economy , free flow of information , freedom of speech ; the rule of law ; and Hong Kong 's position as a world class international financial centre and Asia 's largest venture capital centre .

" These include our dedication to maintaining our status as a free port , high transparency of laws and regulations , an impartial legal and judicial system , a free flow of information , a capable civil service as well as a clean government free of corruption , " he added .  
These include the rule of law upheld by an independent judiciary ; open and accountable government ; a clean civil service ; a level playing field for business ; a duty-free port ; low taxes ; free movement of goods , capital and people ; the free and unfettered flow of news information and ideas ; and a whole range of freedoms guaranteed and protected by our constitution , the Basic Law - for example , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , of expression , freedom to travel .  
Except in relation to defence and foreign affairs , Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy .  Its social and economic systems were to remain unchanged .  Its status as a free port and a separate customs territory were to be retained .  
In the fourth quarter of 2000 , the port of Hong Kong handled 4.7 million TEUs containers , representing a growth of 8% over a year earlier .  Within this total , laden containers rose by 8% to 3.7 million TEUs , while empty containers increased by 10% to 1.0 million TEUs .  
Hong Kong also provides comprehensive supporting facilities .  These include well developed port facilities and land transport , a sound legal system firmly rooted in the common law tradition , excellent financing and e-commerce support as well as highly efficient customs services .  
As to outward port cargo , marked increases were recorded for artificial resins and plastic materials ( + 40% ) , iron and steel ( + 28% ) , metalliferous ores and metal scrap ( + 27% ) , pulp and waste paper ( + 17% ) , furniture and parts thereof ( + 16% ) , and live animals chiefly for food and edible animal products ( + 13% ) .  
" In order to strike a proper balance between the operational needs of the trade and the importance for avoiding adverse environmental impacts and nuisances of such uses to the nearby residents , the Board has formulated a strategy for tackling issues related to the consideration of applications for temporary open storage and port back-up uses in the rural New Territories , " the spokesman explained .  
Through years of hard work our enterprising businessmen and productive workers , together with our unique blend of public and private sector collaboration , have made Hong Kong a major hub port in the global supply chain - a hub that is endowed with a strategic location .  
Speaking at the Hong Kong Business Seminar in Osaka , Miss Cheung said Hong Kong 's unique advantages for Japanese businesses intending to make their inroads into the huge China market included its financial and legal services , port and airport facilities , high quality professionals with excellent knowledge of doing business in China and their extensive network of contacts .  
Addressing over 200 prominent guests at a business reception in Nagasaki , Miss Cheung said these advantages included Hong Kong 's financial and legal services , port and airport facilities , high quality professionals with excellent knowledge of doing business in China and their extensive network of contacts . 
As for outward port cargo , exports ( including domestic exports and re-exports ) decreased by 17% over a year earlier to 7.8 million tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2001 .  Within this total , both seaborne and river exports fell , by 12% and 24% respectively .  
We owe much of our success to the speedy , reliable and efficient service of the industry , fast-growing economic growth in the Mainland and our strategic location at the hub of the Pearl River Delta area , the largest manufacturing base in the world .  Hong Kong serves as the country 's premier port for foreign trade , handling 70% of the container cargo in southern China last year .  
As for outward port cargo , significant increases were recorded in pulp and waste paper ( + 23% ) , organic chemicals ( + 12% ) , artificial resins and plastic materials ( + 11% ) and iron and steel ( + 11% ) .

The main objective of the study , which will be completed in late 2003 , is to formulate a competitive and sustainable strategy and master plan for Hong Kong 's port development for the coming 20 years and beyond .  
The Heritage Foundation acknowledged that Hong Kong 's virtues included a duty-free port , very low barriers to foreign investment , very low level of restrictions in banking and finance , low level of intervention in wages and prices , strong property rights and a low level of black market activity .  
In view of the continued growth of cargo volume in the Pearl River Delta , the Economic Development and Labour Bureau has commissioned a study on Hong Kong Port - Master Plan 2020 ( HKP2020 ) to formulate a competitive and sustainable strategy and master plan for Hong Kong 's port development , including the location for major container terminal ports and related infrastructure up to the year 2020 .  
He noted that Hong Kong , as the world 's top container port and a member of the international community , had played an active and responsible role in meeting various challenges to maintain the smooth flow of containers around the global supply chain and to enhance the security of global maritime trade , citing Hong Kong 's action in response to the US 's Container Security Initiatives ( CSI ) .  
Comparing the fourth quarter of 2002 with the fourth quarter of 2001 , double-digit increases were recorded in inward port cargo of stone , sand and gravel ( + 30% ) , metalliferous ores and metal scrap ( + 28% ) , iron and steel ( + 28% ) , coal , coke and briquettes ( + 23% ) , artificial resins and plastic materials ( + 19% ) , and petroleum , petroleum products and related materials ( + 12% ) .

Mr Jackson said that Hong Kong people expected to have the world 's freest economy ( a ranking that was reaffirmed by the Cato Institute this week ) , the lowest crime and corruption rates in the region , the busiest container port , the most popular international airport , the busiest air-cargo hub , the most independent judiciary , the strongest legal system , and the widest guaranteed freedoms .  
The main objective of the HKP2020 Study is to formulate a competitive and sustainable strategy and master plan for Hong Kong 's port development , including the location of major container terminal port and related infrastructure projects , over the planning period .  
The freeway extends from Keelung , the northern port of Taiwan , traversing through the lush and densely populated narrow western plain of the island to the southern port of Kaohsiung .  
With the completion of the North Link Railroad between Suao and Hualien , a major port city at the northern end of the narrow coastal plain due to be completed by the end of this year , further development in eastern Taiwan is possible .  
And the Hong Kong government has adopted a laissez-faire , internationalist economic policy , leaving companies pretty much alone as long as they pay their annual tax . These factors , combined with an advantageous geographical location that has enabled the colony to become the world 's second largest transshipment port , have created a society where business is boss . "  
At the end of the Ch'ing , the port became obstructed by silt , and it lost its value as a port . The local center of activity shifted to Chunan . And when the railroad was built , it only stopped at Chunan , further isolating Chungkang .  
It so happened that the project coincided with the Ministry of Communication 's hunt for a new deepwater port facility , and a joint outline was drawn up which envisioned a reclaimed land area of 6,700 hectares , and investment of some 400 billion NT dollars . The blueprint for eventual use of the dry land area is still undergoing approval at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
The main difference between the two blueprints is that Kaohsiung City Government , which is the landlord and is carrying out the initial sea reclamation work , hopes to find a new face for the city in the new land , and is wary of letting it fall into the hands of outsiders . The Ministry of Communications , however , which operates the international port at the same location and is responsible for overall future on-site development , emphasizes the national interest and sees the new territory in terms of energy resources and transportation infrastructure .  
When the island 's deep water port , international airport , and plentiful supply of cheap labor are considered , it is clear why Penang has received so much attention from foreign investors .  
Originally many of the Chinese in Singapore were illiterate and had inferiority complexes , which were aggravated by their living in an international port like Singapore where English was paramount . They broke their backs working so their children could study abroad .  
Moreover , Hong Kong has become an international free port in the last twenty years and a financial center . Apart from its explosion of wealth , it has also been very hard to resist the temptations of the flow of imported luxuries from all over the world . Thus , generally speaking , most Hong Kong people like to boast about what they love to enjoy ; enjoyment ( usually material ) has become a very important social value .  
The public hearing gained the attention and sup port of the township council , the mayor and the citizens of Meinung . So in 1993 the Love Meinung Alliance was set up . It incorporated local leaders such as the mayor , neighborhood chiefs , social organizations and people from cultural circles , holding seminars in every neighborhood . They distributed hand-outs , and they decided to go north to Taipei to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan , requesting the reservoir 's budget be eliminated .  
But Taiwan is a major trading area , and includes the world 's third busiest port ( Kaohsiung ) . Ships come and go 24 hours a day , and there are countless business travelers and tourists . Meanwhile dealers are constantly coming up with new ways to smuggle contraband - - tucked into ship containers , hidden away in luggage , even inserted or swallowed into the human body .  
Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
The main reasons for this are that with direct shipping most freight moving between the two sides will no longer need to be transshipped through Hong Kong . Scholars estimate that with direct shipping across the strait , the volume of cargo passing through Hong Kong will shrink by 1 million standard containers . Although this is less than one tenth of Hong Kong 's total volume , it will probably affect Hong Kong 's status as the world 's largest transshipment port .  
In order to smooth the way for Bayer to invest in Taichung County , the MOEA announced that after the plant begins operations , each year it will pay NT $ 1.5 billion in business tax and NT $ 150 million in building tax , and that 300 jobs will be created in total . The volume of imported materials and exported finished products will total 1.3 million tonnes per year , which will help Taichung Harbor develop into a major international commercial port .  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
Where they had once viewed the island as a convenient port of call for their merchant vessels , they now schemed to take complete control . Awakened to the dangers posed by aggressive foreign powers , the Qing court dispatched Shen Baozhen in 1874 to develop Taiwan 's infrastructure and strengthen its defenses . The work started by Shen was continued by Ding Richang , who arrived in 1876 . In order to make sure that foreign powers would n't have any further opportunity for incursions into northern Taiwan , Shen had Taipei elevated to prefectural status .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
The words " If You Catch Me , Report Me " in large characters , along with the distinctive shape of the whale shark with its broad , flattened head , square snout , and large , wide mouth , make for an eye-catching sight amid the blue and gray hues of a busy port .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
This July , planning will be completed for the first free port in Taiwan , which should increase the efficiency of the movement of goods significantly . This will be helpful to Taiwan 's becoming a regional operations center for both local businesses and multinational companies .  
But all good things must come to an end , and during the reign of Emperor Guangxu ( 1875-1895 ) , provincial governor Liu Mingchuan decided that Changhua 's port at Lukang was too silted and shallow , and gradually it fell into disuse . Liu chose to move the provincial capital to Taichung , thus laying the foundations for that city 's future growth , while Changhua , which had depended on shipping through Lukang , lost its luster .  
Those forces conducting port operations continued building a sustainment base , and the multinational force established a complete headquarters for the Joint Task Force commander in the PortauPrince industrial complex .  
Field projects . ( i ) Establishment of four port reception facilities in the Mediterranean ; ( ii ) two field projects on the assessment of threats to marine mammals ; ( iii ) one marine biodiversity assessment ; ( iv ) strengthening of four institutional arrangements for integrated coastal zone planning and management ; and ( v ) 10 projects to assist Mediterranean countries to set up their legislation concerning specially protected areas .  
The Working Group agreed that the United Nations will provide transportation on a contractual basis or reimburse contributing countries through letter-of-assist procedures for transporting contingent-owned equipment ( including all major and minor equipment and consumables authorized for deployment by the United Nations ) from a port of embarkation in the Member State 's territory to the mission area and back to the Member State in accordance with current practice .  
A proposal be considered by the General Assembly to reimburse the actual cost of inland transportation of major equipment from its normal operating location to an agreed port of embarkation , subject to the presentation of validated claims ;  
The economy is dual and is characterized by an important informal sector directed towards customers with a low purchasing power , and by a modern economy based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , serving a population with a high purchasing power but almost strictly dependent on imports .  
The detailed information required for these purposes includes the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . ammunition ) and any specific handling instructions .  
Israel 's premeditated and unbridled aerial and artillery attacks over the past five days against many civilian quarters in towns and villages of Lebanon , including the southern suburbs of Beirut , and its naval blockade of the port of Beirut are prime examples of acts of terrorism by Israeli policy makers , who all too readily and conveniently label others either as terrorists or as supporters of terrorists . 
The national law against the illegal smuggling of individuals into the country is embodied in the Immigration and Nationality Act , of which , the section entitled " Bringing in and harbouring certain aliens " , sets out criminal penalties , imprisonment and fines for the crimes of bringing or attempting to bring aliens into the country at other than a port of entry , transporting or harbouring undocumented aliens , and encouraging or inducing an alien to come to the country in violation of its law .  
Throughout the year , the ESCAP Pacific Operations Centre offered advisory and technical assistance to Pacific island countries in development programming , central banking , macroeconomic policy formulation , financial systems , trade promotion , development of port infrastructure and macroeconomic management , and provided short consultancies upon specific requests .  
The project foresees technical assistance from UNCTAD , primarily in the establishment of institutional , operational and managerial capacities , and the necessary legal framework for the proper setting up and functioning of the port .  
As a substitute for the multinational interception force 's ship inspection operation near the port of Aqaba , the Committee was informed by Jordan in June 1994 that the Government was discussing with Lloyd 's Register the possibility of concluding an agreement that would ensure the continuing strict implementation of the sanctions regime established under resolution 661 ( 1990 ) .  
In October 1995 , fighting increased in intensity between rival factions in the city , causing the country 's main port in south Mogadishu to cease functioning and to have a negative effect on the flow of humanitarian assistance to the city and to the interior regions of the country .  
The needs in the region are more comprehensive than the institution of port State control , and concern also the lack of adequate maritime administrative infrastructure , of national legislation to implement the requirements of international maritime conventions , and trained personnel at all levels . 
Furthermore , there was general agreement that the incentives regarding commercial value , contained in some national salvage law , should not be included in the future instrument ; that warships should be excluded from the scope of application of the instrument ; that an approach based on flag State jurisdiction , and port State jurisdiction , supplemented by existing coastal State jurisdiction , was the more acceptable solution for enforcement ;  
Thus the decisive impact of transport efficiency on countries ' competitiveness and their ability to attract foreign direct investment is obvious : since the annual cost of international maritime transport was estimated at US $ 250-billion in 1994 ( half of which being incurred in ports ) , a 5 per cent reduction in port and transport costs could save traders some US $ 12.5-billion per annum .  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
Djibouti has a dual economy that is characterized by an important informal sector directed towards customers with a low purchasing power , and secondly , by a modern economy , based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , serving a population with high purchasing power but one that depends almost entirely on imports .  
Spain reported on initiatives to combat marine pollution , including the control and monitoring of maritime transport of pollutant products that may have an impact on the environment ; the prevention of pollution from ships ; the monitoring and control of industrial waste or waste from ships ; and active participation in the implementation of specific maritime safety plans in each port , taking into account current provisions including those of the National Regulation for the Admission , Handling and Storage of Hazardous Goods in Ports .  
A number of experts expressed concern at the slow and cumbersome procedures which continued to cause considerable delays in moving transit cargo out of the port and across national boundaries .  
Identification of the most suitable river and port options and navigational facilities on the Amazon River and its northern tributaries , in accordance with a regime which guarantees Ecuador free , gratuitous , uninterrupted and perpetual access ;  
In response to specific concerns raised in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 , the IMO secretariat and its governing bodies have undertaken a number of new or expanded initiatives with respect to prevention of air pollution from ships ; new special sea areas and particularly sensitive sea areas ; irradiated nuclear fuel on board ships ; traffic separation schemes and mandatory ship-reporting systems ; port State control ; and the preparation of measures against tributyltin-based anti-fouling paints for ships .  
One of the major problems identified by the Mission was the blockade imposed by the federal authorities on humanitarian assistance entering Montenegro through the port of Bar or from Croatia ( e.g . a large convoy of humanitarian aid including medical supplies destined for internally displaced persons had been blocked by the federal authorities for 10 days inside Montenegro ) .

Officers and soldiers of the detachment had undergone several weeks of training in port and along the coast .  They also had undergone simulated attack training scores of times .  Their training programs included radar searches , transmitting target parameters , preparing for missile attacks , and making command decisions .  Their reaction time has continuously shortened .  The operational skills of relevant personnel have been greatly improved .  All these factors have laid a foundation for the detachment in successfully using missiles to attack mobile target ships that can change speed and direction .  
The officers and men of the rescue regiment began by studying actual international submarine rescue efforts in recent years , mobilized officers and men , organs , and key divers to conduct in-depth research at submarine forces to familiarize themselves with submarine structures and features , envisage various possible submarine accidents , formulate draft rescue plans directed at different situations and different sea areas , and conduct repeat training from the port to the sea and from above to below the water so as to continuously raise the troops ' rapid response capability in dealing with submarine accidents .  
Then , under Helen 's command , the US special mixed fleet turned and fled toward the open waters .  In 1996 , when the PLA conducted a military exercise including test-firing its guided missiles , the United States also sent aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait . After the PLA 's nuclear submarines departed from their military port and disappeared in the vast seas , the US aircraft carriers immediately left the region .  
Thus , although a formation of U.S . aircraft carriers had shown up more than 100 nautical miles east of Taiwan to make its military presence known during our army 's military exercises in 1996 , it had not actually sailed into the Taiwan Straits . Moreover , as soon as the U.S . forces learned that a number of Chinese nuclear submarines had lifted anchor and left the port , the aircraft carrier battle group immediately moved back 100 nautical miles .

Upon receiving an emergency order , the naval training vessel " Shichang " set sail in a thick fog with visibility of only 15 m .  It braved the wind and the waves of a near Force 10 typhoon for 17 days , sailing 4000 nautical miles .  It satisfactorily completed comprehensive training in maritime national defense mobilization with " wartime civilian vessels emergency mobilization and acquisition " as its main task .  The vessel returned to a certain military port in the Bo Hai a few days ago .  
In addition to the three countries ' favorable geographical locations and good port facilities at the Baltic Sea , as West European enterprises have joined in developing China 's west regions , such cooperation has a bright future .  
Many local residents drove several hundred miles [ as received ] from Seattle to Everett port to view the Chinese Navy , and there were long lines of cars waiting outside the port and a great throng of people inside ; the US Navy was continually operating more vehicles to carry the passengers , but was unable to meet the demand .  Ms .  
Grasping development as the main theme , Tianjin has three great historic tasks to fulfill at the start of the new century : to build a modern international port city and a major economic center of north China ; to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economy structure ; and to become one of the regions in the lead in basically achieving modernization .  
After its return to the motherland , Hong Kong will retain the status of a free port and an international financial , trade and shipping centre while continuing to maintain and develop its economic and cultural relations with other countries , regions and relevant international organisations so that this international economic metropolis will forever be vigorous and dynamic .  
Its advantageous geographical location , its free port policy of complete openness , its well-developed legal system and highly efficient team of civil service , and its effective economic management and civic administration have all facilitated Hong Kong 's economic development .

We have one of the most modern airports in the world .  We are at the doorstep of the vast and yet untapped market of the Mainland of China ; a duty free port in the middle of East Asia ; and half of the world 's population is within a flying time of five hours from Hong Kong , " he said .  
Officiating at the ceremony , Chairman of the Provisional Urban Council 's Entertainment Select Committee , Ms Christina Ting Yuk-chee said , " A hundred years ago , Hong Kong was a small fishing port .  Today it has developed into a reputable metropolitan in the world .  Such tremendous success was accomplished because of the great zeal and perseverance of Hong Kong people , their shrewdness in making use of the opportunities , their remarkable adaptability to changing environment and their profound creativity .  
We have one of the best ports , airports and mass transit systems in the world .  We have some of the world 's most efficient and cost-effective communication systems and one of the highest concentration of mobile telephones .  We have invested one-fifth of our annual budget in education to ensure the supply of high quality manpower needed for our continuous economic growth .  We have a rich and diversified cultural heritage , a bilingual open society and a free port .  
Noting that the total door-to-door cost of transporting cargoes through Hong Kong versus Shenzhen is narrowing , Mr Lin stressed that Hong Kong 's free port status , simple , speedy and reliable customs clearance system , as well as competitive and predictable costs are very important reasons for shippers to choose it as the loading port . 
He added that Hong Kong 's traditional strengths have contributed to the positive outlook of our e-business development .  These include an excellent business environment , world-renowned physical infrastructure such as the port and the airport , an open market economy , free flow of information , freedom of speech ; the rule of law ; and Hong Kong 's position as a world class international financial centre and Asia 's largest venture capital centre .

" These include our dedication to maintaining our status as a free port , high transparency of laws and regulations , an impartial legal and judicial system , a free flow of information , a capable civil service as well as a clean government free of corruption , " he added .  
These include the rule of law upheld by an independent judiciary ; open and accountable government ; a clean civil service ; a level playing field for business ; a duty-free port ; low taxes ; free movement of goods , capital and people ; the free and unfettered flow of news information and ideas ; and a whole range of freedoms guaranteed and protected by our constitution , the Basic Law - for example , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , of expression , freedom to travel .  
Except in relation to defence and foreign affairs , Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy .  Its social and economic systems were to remain unchanged .  Its status as a free port and a separate customs territory were to be retained .  
In the fourth quarter of 2000 , the port of Hong Kong handled 4.7 million TEUs containers , representing a growth of 8% over a year earlier .  Within this total , laden containers rose by 8% to 3.7 million TEUs , while empty containers increased by 10% to 1.0 million TEUs .  
Hong Kong also provides comprehensive supporting facilities .  These include well developed port facilities and land transport , a sound legal system firmly rooted in the common law tradition , excellent financing and e-commerce support as well as highly efficient customs services .  
As to outward port cargo , marked increases were recorded for artificial resins and plastic materials ( + 40% ) , iron and steel ( + 28% ) , metalliferous ores and metal scrap ( + 27% ) , pulp and waste paper ( + 17% ) , furniture and parts thereof ( + 16% ) , and live animals chiefly for food and edible animal products ( + 13% ) .  
" In order to strike a proper balance between the operational needs of the trade and the importance for avoiding adverse environmental impacts and nuisances of such uses to the nearby residents , the Board has formulated a strategy for tackling issues related to the consideration of applications for temporary open storage and port back-up uses in the rural New Territories , " the spokesman explained .  
Through years of hard work our enterprising businessmen and productive workers , together with our unique blend of public and private sector collaboration , have made Hong Kong a major hub port in the global supply chain - a hub that is endowed with a strategic location .  
Speaking at the Hong Kong Business Seminar in Osaka , Miss Cheung said Hong Kong 's unique advantages for Japanese businesses intending to make their inroads into the huge China market included its financial and legal services , port and airport facilities , high quality professionals with excellent knowledge of doing business in China and their extensive network of contacts .  
Addressing over 200 prominent guests at a business reception in Nagasaki , Miss Cheung said these advantages included Hong Kong 's financial and legal services , port and airport facilities , high quality professionals with excellent knowledge of doing business in China and their extensive network of contacts . 
As for outward port cargo , exports ( including domestic exports and re-exports ) decreased by 17% over a year earlier to 7.8 million tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2001 .  Within this total , both seaborne and river exports fell , by 12% and 24% respectively .  
We owe much of our success to the speedy , reliable and efficient service of the industry , fast-growing economic growth in the Mainland and our strategic location at the hub of the Pearl River Delta area , the largest manufacturing base in the world .  Hong Kong serves as the country 's premier port for foreign trade , handling 70% of the container cargo in southern China last year .  
As for outward port cargo , significant increases were recorded in pulp and waste paper ( + 23% ) , organic chemicals ( + 12% ) , artificial resins and plastic materials ( + 11% ) and iron and steel ( + 11% ) .

The main objective of the study , which will be completed in late 2003 , is to formulate a competitive and sustainable strategy and master plan for Hong Kong 's port development for the coming 20 years and beyond .  
The Heritage Foundation acknowledged that Hong Kong 's virtues included a duty-free port , very low barriers to foreign investment , very low level of restrictions in banking and finance , low level of intervention in wages and prices , strong property rights and a low level of black market activity .  
In view of the continued growth of cargo volume in the Pearl River Delta , the Economic Development and Labour Bureau has commissioned a study on Hong Kong Port - Master Plan 2020 ( HKP2020 ) to formulate a competitive and sustainable strategy and master plan for Hong Kong 's port development , including the location for major container terminal ports and related infrastructure up to the year 2020 .  
He noted that Hong Kong , as the world 's top container port and a member of the international community , had played an active and responsible role in meeting various challenges to maintain the smooth flow of containers around the global supply chain and to enhance the security of global maritime trade , citing Hong Kong 's action in response to the US 's Container Security Initiatives ( CSI ) .  
Comparing the fourth quarter of 2002 with the fourth quarter of 2001 , double-digit increases were recorded in inward port cargo of stone , sand and gravel ( + 30% ) , metalliferous ores and metal scrap ( + 28% ) , iron and steel ( + 28% ) , coal , coke and briquettes ( + 23% ) , artificial resins and plastic materials ( + 19% ) , and petroleum , petroleum products and related materials ( + 12% ) .

Mr Jackson said that Hong Kong people expected to have the world 's freest economy ( a ranking that was reaffirmed by the Cato Institute this week ) , the lowest crime and corruption rates in the region , the busiest container port , the most popular international airport , the busiest air-cargo hub , the most independent judiciary , the strongest legal system , and the widest guaranteed freedoms .  
The main objective of the HKP2020 Study is to formulate a competitive and sustainable strategy and master plan for Hong Kong 's port development , including the location of major container terminal port and related infrastructure projects , over the planning period .  
The freeway extends from Keelung , the northern port of Taiwan , traversing through the lush and densely populated narrow western plain of the island to the southern port of Kaohsiung .  
With the completion of the North Link Railroad between Suao and Hualien , a major port city at the northern end of the narrow coastal plain due to be completed by the end of this year , further development in eastern Taiwan is possible .  
And the Hong Kong government has adopted a laissez-faire , internationalist economic policy , leaving companies pretty much alone as long as they pay their annual tax . These factors , combined with an advantageous geographical location that has enabled the colony to become the world 's second largest transshipment port , have created a society where business is boss . "  
At the end of the Ch'ing , the port became obstructed by silt , and it lost its value as a port . The local center of activity shifted to Chunan . And when the railroad was built , it only stopped at Chunan , further isolating Chungkang .  
It so happened that the project coincided with the Ministry of Communication 's hunt for a new deepwater port facility , and a joint outline was drawn up which envisioned a reclaimed land area of 6,700 hectares , and investment of some 400 billion NT dollars . The blueprint for eventual use of the dry land area is still undergoing approval at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
The main difference between the two blueprints is that Kaohsiung City Government , which is the landlord and is carrying out the initial sea reclamation work , hopes to find a new face for the city in the new land , and is wary of letting it fall into the hands of outsiders . The Ministry of Communications , however , which operates the international port at the same location and is responsible for overall future on-site development , emphasizes the national interest and sees the new territory in terms of energy resources and transportation infrastructure .  
When the island 's deep water port , international airport , and plentiful supply of cheap labor are considered , it is clear why Penang has received so much attention from foreign investors .  
Originally many of the Chinese in Singapore were illiterate and had inferiority complexes , which were aggravated by their living in an international port like Singapore where English was paramount . They broke their backs working so their children could study abroad .  
Moreover , Hong Kong has become an international free port in the last twenty years and a financial center . Apart from its explosion of wealth , it has also been very hard to resist the temptations of the flow of imported luxuries from all over the world . Thus , generally speaking , most Hong Kong people like to boast about what they love to enjoy ; enjoyment ( usually material ) has become a very important social value .  
The public hearing gained the attention and sup port of the township council , the mayor and the citizens of Meinung . So in 1993 the Love Meinung Alliance was set up . It incorporated local leaders such as the mayor , neighborhood chiefs , social organizations and people from cultural circles , holding seminars in every neighborhood . They distributed hand-outs , and they decided to go north to Taipei to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan , requesting the reservoir 's budget be eliminated .  
But Taiwan is a major trading area , and includes the world 's third busiest port ( Kaohsiung ) . Ships come and go 24 hours a day , and there are countless business travelers and tourists . Meanwhile dealers are constantly coming up with new ways to smuggle contraband - - tucked into ship containers , hidden away in luggage , even inserted or swallowed into the human body .  
Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
The main reasons for this are that with direct shipping most freight moving between the two sides will no longer need to be transshipped through Hong Kong . Scholars estimate that with direct shipping across the strait , the volume of cargo passing through Hong Kong will shrink by 1 million standard containers . Although this is less than one tenth of Hong Kong 's total volume , it will probably affect Hong Kong 's status as the world 's largest transshipment port .  
In order to smooth the way for Bayer to invest in Taichung County , the MOEA announced that after the plant begins operations , each year it will pay NT $ 1.5 billion in business tax and NT $ 150 million in building tax , and that 300 jobs will be created in total . The volume of imported materials and exported finished products will total 1.3 million tonnes per year , which will help Taichung Harbor develop into a major international commercial port .  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
Where they had once viewed the island as a convenient port of call for their merchant vessels , they now schemed to take complete control . Awakened to the dangers posed by aggressive foreign powers , the Qing court dispatched Shen Baozhen in 1874 to develop Taiwan 's infrastructure and strengthen its defenses . The work started by Shen was continued by Ding Richang , who arrived in 1876 . In order to make sure that foreign powers would n't have any further opportunity for incursions into northern Taiwan , Shen had Taipei elevated to prefectural status .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
The words " If You Catch Me , Report Me " in large characters , along with the distinctive shape of the whale shark with its broad , flattened head , square snout , and large , wide mouth , make for an eye-catching sight amid the blue and gray hues of a busy port .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
This July , planning will be completed for the first free port in Taiwan , which should increase the efficiency of the movement of goods significantly . This will be helpful to Taiwan 's becoming a regional operations center for both local businesses and multinational companies .  
But all good things must come to an end , and during the reign of Emperor Guangxu ( 1875-1895 ) , provincial governor Liu Mingchuan decided that Changhua 's port at Lukang was too silted and shallow , and gradually it fell into disuse . Liu chose to move the provincial capital to Taichung , thus laying the foundations for that city 's future growth , while Changhua , which had depended on shipping through Lukang , lost its luster .  
Those forces conducting port operations continued building a sustainment base , and the multinational force established a complete headquarters for the Joint Task Force commander in the PortauPrince industrial complex .  
Field projects . ( i ) Establishment of four port reception facilities in the Mediterranean ; ( ii ) two field projects on the assessment of threats to marine mammals ; ( iii ) one marine biodiversity assessment ; ( iv ) strengthening of four institutional arrangements for integrated coastal zone planning and management ; and ( v ) 10 projects to assist Mediterranean countries to set up their legislation concerning specially protected areas .  
The Working Group agreed that the United Nations will provide transportation on a contractual basis or reimburse contributing countries through letter-of-assist procedures for transporting contingent-owned equipment ( including all major and minor equipment and consumables authorized for deployment by the United Nations ) from a port of embarkation in the Member State 's territory to the mission area and back to the Member State in accordance with current practice .  
A proposal be considered by the General Assembly to reimburse the actual cost of inland transportation of major equipment from its normal operating location to an agreed port of embarkation , subject to the presentation of validated claims ;  
The economy is dual and is characterized by an important informal sector directed towards customers with a low purchasing power , and by a modern economy based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , serving a population with a high purchasing power but almost strictly dependent on imports .  
The detailed information required for these purposes includes the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . ammunition ) and any specific handling instructions .  
Israel 's premeditated and unbridled aerial and artillery attacks over the past five days against many civilian quarters in towns and villages of Lebanon , including the southern suburbs of Beirut , and its naval blockade of the port of Beirut are prime examples of acts of terrorism by Israeli policy makers , who all too readily and conveniently label others either as terrorists or as supporters of terrorists . 
The national law against the illegal smuggling of individuals into the country is embodied in the Immigration and Nationality Act , of which , the section entitled " Bringing in and harbouring certain aliens " , sets out criminal penalties , imprisonment and fines for the crimes of bringing or attempting to bring aliens into the country at other than a port of entry , transporting or harbouring undocumented aliens , and encouraging or inducing an alien to come to the country in violation of its law .  
Throughout the year , the ESCAP Pacific Operations Centre offered advisory and technical assistance to Pacific island countries in development programming , central banking , macroeconomic policy formulation , financial systems , trade promotion , development of port infrastructure and macroeconomic management , and provided short consultancies upon specific requests .  
The project foresees technical assistance from UNCTAD , primarily in the establishment of institutional , operational and managerial capacities , and the necessary legal framework for the proper setting up and functioning of the port .  
As a substitute for the multinational interception force 's ship inspection operation near the port of Aqaba , the Committee was informed by Jordan in June 1994 that the Government was discussing with Lloyd 's Register the possibility of concluding an agreement that would ensure the continuing strict implementation of the sanctions regime established under resolution 661 ( 1990 ) .  
In October 1995 , fighting increased in intensity between rival factions in the city , causing the country 's main port in south Mogadishu to cease functioning and to have a negative effect on the flow of humanitarian assistance to the city and to the interior regions of the country .  
The needs in the region are more comprehensive than the institution of port State control , and concern also the lack of adequate maritime administrative infrastructure , of national legislation to implement the requirements of international maritime conventions , and trained personnel at all levels . 
Furthermore , there was general agreement that the incentives regarding commercial value , contained in some national salvage law , should not be included in the future instrument ; that warships should be excluded from the scope of application of the instrument ; that an approach based on flag State jurisdiction , and port State jurisdiction , supplemented by existing coastal State jurisdiction , was the more acceptable solution for enforcement ;  
Thus the decisive impact of transport efficiency on countries ' competitiveness and their ability to attract foreign direct investment is obvious : since the annual cost of international maritime transport was estimated at US $ 250-billion in 1994 ( half of which being incurred in ports ) , a 5 per cent reduction in port and transport costs could save traders some US $ 12.5-billion per annum .
