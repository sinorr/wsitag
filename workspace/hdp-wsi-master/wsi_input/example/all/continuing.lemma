In particular , the 23 November demonstration on the streets of Taipei by 120,000 farmers and fishermen drew the attention of the whole nation . It stole much of the thunder from the first round of live TV debates between the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates , which had taken place shortly beforehand . The lack of coordination between the presidential office and the cabinet , the voices of dissent against the central government from within the ruling DPP and the continuing political fallout from the cabinet reshuffle will inevitably impact the Taipei and Kaohsiung elections .  
As of May 23 , there were 538 probable SARS cases in Taiwan , and more than 60 deaths , making Taiwan the third worst affected country in the world after mainland China and Hong Kong .

In addition to technical and vocational students continuing on in education in large numbers and thus leading to the withering away of the " inherently " inferior " second track , " the lack of official expenditures in this area have amounted to " kicking a man when he is down , " and the gap between the two national educational " tracks " has widened significantly .  
While continuing to work in the classical field , Lee also turned his attention to pop music . He could n't stand the schmaltzy love tales that characterized Mandarin pop lyrics , and he always found the music itself excessively influenced by Japanese teeny-bopper styles . Thus he took his background in academic music and plunged headfirst into the vulgar world of pop , determined to refine the genre and bring it to a higher level .

The Republic of China 's standing as the fifteenth largest trading nation in the world , with the twentieth highest gross national product and the largest foreign-exchange holdings , its continuing assistance to many developing countries and its efforts to strengthen international economic cooperation are obvious and can not be ignored by the world 's highest forum .

Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
This continuing practice by the United States of America , which is unwarranted and contrary to its legal and moral obligations under the Headquarters Agreement , the Charter of the United Nations and international custom , points to a serious shortcoming that must be eliminated and corrected by all possible means .

The continuing plundering of the cultural heritage of the Greek Cypriots and the changing demographic structure of the area under Turkish military occupation through massive importation of settlers were two additional characteristics of the unacceptable situation created in Cyprus through the force of arms .  
However , the international community 's determination to confront the new menace of illicit trafficking in nuclear material , on which the Agency is now developing a valuable database , should not distract attention from the continuing need to maintain vigilance over the dumping of radioactive wastes and other highly toxic substances in the territories of developing countries .  
During the 1980s , many African countries experienced sluggish economic growth , attributable to exogenous shocks , as well as to the latent structural weakness of many of the economies and the continuing high dependence on a few primary commodities .

Certainly , the human tragedy of this continuing matter is enormous both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship and in terms of the relatives of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .

The Indonesian delegation shares the deep concern expressed in the draft resolution regarding the continuing violation of international humanitarian law and human rights in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia , as well as the potential consequences for the peace process if this terrible and tragic situation is not expeditiously dealt with .  
My Government therefore finds it disappointing that sponsors of draft resolution A / C . 1 / 50 / L . 39 were apparently unable to accept even a cross-reference to the contribution made to enhanced international security by the continuing strict adherence of non-nuclear-weapon States to multilateral and legally binding non-proliferation undertakings that are verified by full-scope nuclear safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency .

The United States of America , continuing to ignore the views of specialized agencies and the readiness of Cuba to establish a serious exchange of information on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality of States and mutual respect , had not halted its illegal television and radio broadcasts directed against Cuba , openly violating the most basic norms of coexistence and international law .

continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ;

the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Stresses the need for finding effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of the poorest and most indebted developing countries and the importance of a full , constructive and expeditious implementation of the Naples terms , agreed upon in the Paris Club in December 1994 , for such countries , with a view to helping them exit from the rescheduling process on the basis of sound economic policies in those countries , thus contributing to the promotion of their prospects for resuming growth and development ;

Council expressed its deep regret that the Government of Iraq was continuing to produce bacteriological weapons of a pestilential nature to inflict overwhelming damage on Iraq itself and on the region as a whole , in addition to its production of chemical and radioactive weapons that were no less dangerous and destructive .  
Clarification was sought and received regarding how the staff resources and grade structure of the translation services would be adjusted through the budget process to reflect the continuing increase in documentation ; the impact of increased reliance on contractual translation ; and the intent to expand the use of the optical disk system .  
Although the international community has succeeded , by dint of serious negotiations , in resolving many difficult problems and has achieved important results in many sensitive areas through the establishment of the World Trade Organization , we are still concerned by the continuing practice of trade protectionism , which runs counter to our belief in the importance of allowing market forces to play their natural role in economic affairs .  
There is evidence the world over that continuing poverty , if not addressed adequately , will result in social disharmony and in economic and political disorder , and will become a threat to national and international peace and stability , thereby negatively affecting the growth and consolidation of democracy and human rights .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
Instead of continuing to be caught up in a log-jam with no solution in sight , the concept of permanent regional representation offers a practical alternative and a viable model for the future structure of the Security Council .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
Furthermore , the continuing measures against Cuba , contrary to the letter and spirit of General Assembly resolutions , are most definitely incompatible with the position and stature of a permanent member of the Security Council In the absence of any move by the United States to repeal the relevant Act , Member States may be justified in concluding that the United States has adopted a negative attitude by ignoring the will and expressed wishes of members of the General Assembly . 
The draft resolution also reaffirms the continuing need for practical measures to mitigate the negative impact of the sanctions on the affected States by supporting their financial stabilization , developing the transport and communications infrastructure , promoting trade and increasing their active involvement in the post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation of the region .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
However , the economy of the territory has not changed and the occupying authority , Israel , is continuing its old practices , which are incompatible with international law and local custom , including unjustified detention , blockades , collective punishment and the expansion of existing settlements .  
Thus the Government of Jordan , in order to maintain the Holy City 's special religious , cultural and historic character , has taken a strong interest in continuing its custodianship of the holy places so as to protect them from all dangers until the desired final status is achieved .  
Despite continuing difficulties , a basis had now been laid for a qualitatively new political and psychological climate in the region that opened the way for the peaceful coexistence of Palestinians and Israelis and the attainment of specific results in the current negotiating stage , which was both complex and sensitive . 
The full realization of human rights , however , remained fragile , as was apparent not only from the tragedies in Rwanda and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , but also from the continuing violations in all parts of the world , which took the form of summary executions , arbitrary detention , disappearances and torture and manifestations of new forms of racism and xenophobia in disregard of the fundamental principles of humanitarian law .  
He deplored the continuing flagrant mass violations of human rights taking place throughout the world , and concluded that the protection and promotion of human rights was a long and exacting task which required the undivided attention and vigilance of all members of the international community , from United Nations bodies and national Governments to non-governmental organizations and individuals .

In the current international circumstances which are undergoing profound changes , while concentrating our strength on advancing the modernization drive and continuing to open up to the outside world , we must keep ourselves sober-headed against the infiltration of the Western ideology .

In particular , the 23 November demonstration on the streets of Taipei by 120,000 farmers and fishermen drew the attention of the whole nation . It stole much of the thunder from the first round of live TV debates between the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates , which had taken place shortly beforehand . The lack of coordination between the presidential office and the cabinet , the voices of dissent against the central government from within the ruling DPP and the continuing political fallout from the cabinet reshuffle will inevitably impact the Taipei and Kaohsiung elections .  
As of May 23 , there were 538 probable SARS cases in Taiwan , and more than 60 deaths , making Taiwan the third worst affected country in the world after mainland China and Hong Kong .

In addition to technical and vocational students continuing on in education in large numbers and thus leading to the withering away of the " inherently " inferior " second track , " the lack of official expenditures in this area have amounted to " kicking a man when he is down , " and the gap between the two national educational " tracks " has widened significantly .  
While continuing to work in the classical field , Lee also turned his attention to pop music . He could n't stand the schmaltzy love tales that characterized Mandarin pop lyrics , and he always found the music itself excessively influenced by Japanese teeny-bopper styles . Thus he took his background in academic music and plunged headfirst into the vulgar world of pop , determined to refine the genre and bring it to a higher level .  
In addition , based on the latest research , it has been discovered that the chaotic state when the universe and heavenly bodies came into existence , the most primordial molecular compound is lithium hydride .

The Republic of China 's standing as the fifteenth largest trading nation in the world , with the twentieth highest gross national product and the largest foreign-exchange holdings , its continuing assistance to many developing countries and its efforts to strengthen international economic cooperation are obvious and can not be ignored by the world 's highest forum .

But continuing large disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries , the debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world , the unemployment , the persistent poverty , speak volumes as to the absence of sufficient progress on this front .

Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
This continuing practice by the United States of America , which is unwarranted and contrary to its legal and moral obligations under the Headquarters Agreement , the Charter of the United Nations and international custom , points to a serious shortcoming that must be eliminated and corrected by all possible means .

The continuing plundering of the cultural heritage of the Greek Cypriots and the changing demographic structure of the area under Turkish military occupation through massive importation of settlers were two additional characteristics of the unacceptable situation created in Cyprus through the force of arms .  
However , the international community 's determination to confront the new menace of illicit trafficking in nuclear material , on which the Agency is now developing a valuable database , should not distract attention from the continuing need to maintain vigilance over the dumping of radioactive wastes and other highly toxic substances in the territories of developing countries .  
During the 1980s , many African countries experienced sluggish economic growth , attributable to exogenous shocks , as well as to the latent structural weakness of many of the economies and the continuing high dependence on a few primary commodities .

Certainly , the human tragedy of this continuing matter is enormous both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship and in terms of the relatives of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .

The Indonesian delegation shares the deep concern expressed in the draft resolution regarding the continuing violation of international humanitarian law and human rights in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia , as well as the potential consequences for the peace process if this terrible and tragic situation is not expeditiously dealt with .  
My Government therefore finds it disappointing that sponsors of draft resolution A / C . 1 / 50 / L . 39 were apparently unable to accept even a cross-reference to the contribution made to enhanced international security by the continuing strict adherence of non-nuclear-weapon States to multilateral and legally binding non-proliferation undertakings that are verified by full-scope nuclear safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency .

The United States of America , continuing to ignore the views of specialized agencies and the readiness of Cuba to establish a serious exchange of information on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality of States and mutual respect , had not halted its illegal television and radio broadcasts directed against Cuba , openly violating the most basic norms of coexistence and international law .

continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,

Stresses the need for finding effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of the poorest and most indebted developing countries and the importance of a full , constructive and expeditious implementation of the Naples terms , agreed upon in the Paris Club in December 1994 , for such countries , with a view to helping them exit from the rescheduling process on the basis of sound economic policies in those countries , thus contributing to the promotion of their prospects for resuming growth and development ;

Council expressed its deep regret that the Government of Iraq was continuing to produce bacteriological weapons of a pestilential nature to inflict overwhelming damage on Iraq itself and on the region as a whole , in addition to its production of chemical and radioactive weapons that were no less dangerous and destructive .  
Clarification was sought and received regarding how the staff resources and grade structure of the translation services would be adjusted through the budget process to reflect the continuing increase in documentation ; the impact of increased reliance on contractual translation ; and the intent to expand the use of the optical disk system .  
Although the international community has succeeded , by dint of serious negotiations , in resolving many difficult problems and has achieved important results in many sensitive areas through the establishment of the World Trade Organization , we are still concerned by the continuing practice of trade protectionism , which runs counter to our belief in the importance of allowing market forces to play their natural role in economic affairs .  
There is evidence the world over that continuing poverty , if not addressed adequately , will result in social disharmony and in economic and political disorder , and will become a threat to national and international peace and stability , thereby negatively affecting the growth and consolidation of democracy and human rights .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
Instead of continuing to be caught up in a log-jam with no solution in sight , the concept of permanent regional representation offers a practical alternative and a viable model for the future structure of the Security Council .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
Furthermore , the continuing measures against Cuba , contrary to the letter and spirit of General Assembly resolutions , are most definitely incompatible with the position and stature of a permanent member of the Security Council In the absence of any move by the United States to repeal the relevant Act , Member States may be justified in concluding that the United States has adopted a negative attitude by ignoring the will and expressed wishes of members of the General Assembly . 
The draft resolution also reaffirms the continuing need for practical measures to mitigate the negative impact of the sanctions on the affected States by supporting their financial stabilization , developing the transport and communications infrastructure , promoting trade and increasing their active involvement in the post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation of the region .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
However , the economy of the territory has not changed and the occupying authority , Israel , is continuing its old practices , which are incompatible with international law and local custom , including unjustified detention , blockades , collective punishment and the expansion of existing settlements .  
Thus the Government of Jordan , in order to maintain the Holy City 's special religious , cultural and historic character , has taken a strong interest in continuing its custodianship of the holy places so as to protect them from all dangers until the desired final status is achieved .  
Despite continuing difficulties , a basis had now been laid for a qualitatively new political and psychological climate in the region that opened the way for the peaceful coexistence of Palestinians and Israelis and the attainment of specific results in the current negotiating stage , which was both complex and sensitive . 
The full realization of human rights , however , remained fragile , as was apparent not only from the tragedies in Rwanda and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , but also from the continuing violations in all parts of the world , which took the form of summary executions , arbitrary detention , disappearances and torture and manifestations of new forms of racism and xenophobia in disregard of the fundamental principles of humanitarian law .
