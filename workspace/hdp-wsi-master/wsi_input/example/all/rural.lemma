The basic framework of the study includes : The current population situation and developmental conditions of the Yangtze Delta Region , the regional property development , the developmental trends in property structure and employment population , the developmental trends in urbanization and the development of cities , the total population and the ecological carrying capacity of population resources , the aging of the population , and the social security system of urban and rural areas .  
A government official of Shandong Province told this reporter that this province established agricultural new high level technology development and model zones beginning in 1992 , whose main purpose is to accelerate the transformation of agricultural new high level technology achievements through introducing agricultural new high level technologies from home and abroad to carry out development in order to provide effective models for agricultural production and rural economy development to promote the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture .  
In the face of the strategic readjustment of the agricultural and rural economic structures , we should quickly change the ideas , concepts , leading methods , and the quality of cadres and the masses that are not compatible with the situation in structural readjustment and bring about a tremendous change in the way of thinking and working methods .  
Their ideological and political quality , work style , words and deeds have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies in rural areas , on the reform , development and stability in rural areas , and on the relations between the party and the masses and between the cadres and the masses .  Generally speaking , the great majority of township ( town ) leading cadres are good , diligent , honest in performing official duties and working hard regardless of criticism ;  
If the departments concerned can work in close cooperation , coordinate their actions and produce some tangible results in these activities , it will be conducive to promoting the solution of major and difficult issues that the masses feel very strongly about , thus making the effects of ideological and political work felt deep in the heart of the masses , improving the quality of the population as civilized people , and making the urban and rural areas more civilized .  
In 1999 the average charge per kilowatt of electricity in the rural areas fell by 0.1 yuan , and as a result the peasants paid a total of 23-billion yuan less for their electricity ; many peasants who could not afford electricity in the past have now happily installed color TV and VCD players , and sales of domestic electrical appliances have hotted up in some rural areas .  
Meanwhile , the " Opinions " has also put forward concrete views on how people 's courts can successfully provide a legal guarantee for both the readjustment of the agricultural structure and the development of the rural economy , standardize the financial order according to the law , guard against and avert financial risks , protect intellectual property rights , and provide a guarantee for a sound implementation of the strategy of carrying out a large-scale development in China 's western region .  
He said : Proposals received since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee were broad in content .  They primarily concerned the following : Maintaining a sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy ; strengthening agriculture and doing well in rural work ;  
China 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to the firm leadership of the third-generation leading core .  Zhulin has developed from a hillside village short of water and food into a modern town with all kinds of functions .  Its people , who had worked as farmers for generations , have become town dwellers who created and enjoyed modern civilization .  
In view of this , we feel it a must to integrate the work of returning grain plots with the development of the rural economy , and with the task of extricating peasants from poverty and making them rich ; and a must to find practical and earnest solutions to major problems that are most concerned by the masses , such as sufficient food and firewood as well as increases in their income .  Only in this way can we do a good job in protecting the ecological environment from the basics .  
With the establishment of the market economic system , the change of the macroeconomic situation and , the increase of the total national economic strength , the not high enough quality of the economy in Beijing 's suburbs , its weak ability to adapt to changes , and its insufficient staying power for development are manifesting themselves ever more clearly , and they are becoming the important factors restricting Beijing 's agricultural and rural development .  1 .  
Efforts need to be intensified to reform the system of selecting and promoting grassroots cadres in rural areas and to make correct selection and to select well cadres who meet the basic conditions of possessing good political qualifications , of being able to honestly perform official duties , of having good management capabilities , and of enjoying support from party members and from the masses .  
Training program should be enhanced .  We should help grassroots cadres in rural areas raise their awareness and abilities to lead the masses to readjust the economic structure , and to develop the rural economy , help them raise policy level , enhance legal system concept , change work style , particularly help them raise their levels and capabilities on the correct understanding and handling of the people 's internal contradiction in rural areas in the new period .  
The motions handled since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee , which are rich in content , have mainly included those aimed at maintaining sustained , rapid , and healthy national economic growth ; strengthening agriculture and doing a good job in rural work ; continually and energetically pressing ahead with the state-owned enterprise reform ; guarding against and alleviating the financial crisis ; expanding domestic demand ; continually implementing the principle of opening up to the outside world and vigorously opening up the international market ;  
the vanguard zones of the socialist market economic structure ; and the demonstration zones of sustainable development , which will take the lead in achieving modernization characterized by basically prosperous economy , optimum structure , perfect facilities , beautiful environment , integrated urban and rural areas , sound legal system , and civilized society .  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , the egalitarian system of eating from the same big pot in rural areas has been broken , households have become the main entities for economic operation and investment , and peasants have continuously increased their initiative in participating in the social , political , and economic lives .  
Over more than 20 years of reform and opening up , great development has been made in the rural economy of our country , but the gross economic quantity is still not big enough , and the quality is not high enough .  The current economic conditions still can not satisfy the ever increasing material and cultural needs of the vast number of peasants in their day-to-day lives .  
Since reform and opening up , the living standards of the people in our country have been constantly improving and the actual incomes of urban and rural residents rapidly increasing .  With the remarkable improvement in living conditions , the problem of food and clothing for the people in the whole country has been basically resolved and they are now even marching toward the comparatively well-off level .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
Chen Yaobang said : Through the efforts of several generations , the western region 's agriculture and rural economy will surely develop in a sustained and steady manner and the goal of building the western region into an agricultural producing region with the characteristics of red flowers , green grass and fragrant melons and fruits will surely be realized .  
While inspecting rural areas in Shaanxi recently , Wen Jiabao , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau , member of the Secretariat , and vice premier of the State Council , stressed : This is a crucial year in the new stage of China 's agricultural and rural economic development .  After consecutive years of bumper harvests , the agriculture sector is faced with the heavy tasks of restructuring , raising efficiency , and raising peasants ' income .  Therefore , it is of vital significance to do our job well in agriculture and rural areas .  
Gu Angran said : As reported by judicial organs , a more prominent problem that needs prompt solution at the moment is the question of what kind of work performed by personnel of such rural grass-roots organizations as villagers ' committees in assisting the people 's governments would subject them to the description of " personnel engaged in official business according to law . "  Therefore , the draft interpretation includes a stipulation only on this matter rather than on the full range of " personnel engaged in official business according to law . "  
During the " 10th Five-Year Plan " , the province should remarkably increase the proportion of the non-public sector in its entire economy and should build this sector into a strong motive force to speed up economic growth and employ the jobless in society and into an unexhausted source to increase financial revenues as well as incomes of urban and rural residents .  
A pertinent expert of the Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that some difficulties and problems still existed in the agricultural and rural economic operations at present .  The comparatively conspicuous ones included the relatively great impacts of drought , plant diseases , and insect pests on crops , the continued low prices of most agricultural products , the relatively numerous difficulties confronting the development of township and town enterprises , and so on .  
From a long-term perspective , in order to attain sustained and healthy agricultural and rural economic development , first of all , it is necessary to further push forward the agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment in light of the arrangements made by the central authorities , heighten the quality and economic results of agricultural products , and increase peasants ' income .  
Owing to the slow growth of peasants ' income , the problem of peasants ' burdens is ever more conspicuous .  The work of reducing burdens and increasing income should be done simultaneously , experiments of reforming rural taxes and charges should be properly made , and the work of supervising and managing peasants ' burdens should be performed in real earnest .  The situation of implementing various rules and regulations formulated by the central authorities should be inspected , and all sorts of erroneous practices to increase peasants ' burdens in disguised forms should be resolutely rectified .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
The agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment has a good beginning , quality agricultural products have made rapid development , and the major crop production has been further centralized in the advantageous producing areas .  
have built an omnidirectional stationary civil telecommunications network in light of needs of economic construction and market ; and have built an optical-fiber telecommunications network linking up some rural villages or small towns .  Thus in staging military exercises ;  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
To ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development in Tibet , the party Central Committee has adopted eight major preferential policies for the region , including fiscal , financial , investment , foreign trade , as well as agricultural , animal-husbandry , and rural policies .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .  
In resolving the existing outstanding problems in rural reform and development and achieving a new flying leap in China 's agriculture and rural economy , it is essential to regard development of the rural economy as the main theme , regard deepening the rural reforms and rejuvenating agriculture through science and technology as the motive force , and regard improving the basic living standards of the peasants as the fundamental starting point , and to do a great deal of work in all respects .  
The draft has dedicated an entire chapter to the issue of national defense education for society , and formed stipulations respectively on the formats and demands for developing national defense education by state organs , enterprise units , social groups , committees for city residents , and committees for residents in rural areas ; and the formats and demands of conducting national defense education on militia and people on reserve duty by relevant military organs .  
If we say that since the 1963 National Agro-technology Conference , we have solved the problem of increasing agricultural output , then this session of the National Agro-technology Conference made a strategic adjustment to the direction of the development of agro-technology .  It sets the direction for the development of agricultural technology with optimizing the structure of agriculture , raising agricultural efficiency , improving the rural ecological environment , and strengthening capabilities in the sustainable development of agriculture as the main points for resolving the problem of developing agricultural efficiency .  
Researchers Pan Houren and Zhou Jiahua held that today , when material living standards are improving all the time , it is extremely important to build a rich and excellent cultural life ; the current measures such as small district sports and public welfare facilities which are now being built in a big way , and the rural cultural activities launched by organizing peasants who have become rich are extremely beneficial .  
It firmly takes the steady improvement of the living standards , both material and cultural , of the urban and rural populations as the essential demand of socialism , the fundamental goal of economic development , and the meeting point of the effort to properly handle the relations among reform , development , and stability .  It gives priority to resolving the problems that are of widespread concern to the ordinary people ;  
However , a small number of rural grass-roots cadres have a poor understanding of their mission to wholeheartedly serve the people .  The work style of these cadres is not down-to-earth , their work approach is simple and rude , they do not feel settled in working at the grassroots , and some of them even seek personal profits abusing their powers and encroach on the masses ' interests .  These problems urgently need to be solved .  
The central authorities ' decision to carry out study and educational activities in rural areas throughout the country concerning the important thinking of the " three represents " is an important basic project to step up and improve the party 's leadership over rural work , to deepen rural reform , and boost rural economic and social development , as well as a strategic measure to step up the building of the work style of rural grass-roots cadres .  
The vast numbers of rural grass-roots cadres should practice a good work style and lead the broad masses of peasants to push ahead strategic adjustments of the agricultural and rural economic structures , and help peasants increase their incomes and live a happy life .  
While he was in Hainan , Wei Jianxing went deep to rural areas and peasant households to inspect work , held meetings of discipline inspection and supervision as well as on trade union cadres , and heard reports on the work of the Hainan provincial CPC committee and government .  He fully approved of the Hainan provincial CPC committee and government , in the light of Hainan 's reality .  
While we pay attention to what we have achieved in construction of rural markets , we must also pay attention to the fact that the level of our rural markets is still low and they face such issues as unsound market systems and mechanisms , backward market infrastructures , slow development in the key elements of the market , low degrees of exports , depressed market prices , and low percentages of marketable commodities .  
After liberalized reforms , the systemic reform of the rural economy was a step ahead of that for city economies , but , due to a lack of changes in the agricultural management system by the government , the agricultural product markets and the agricultural key element markets have been split up among various departments such as farming , forestry , economic trade , foreign trade and labor .  In some areas , such administrative departments as animal husbandry , fisheries , and water resources also participate in the market divisions .  
As a result , agriculture was generally regarded as an " inferior " industry .  After liberalized reforms , although agriculture and the rural economies have developed rapidly , the issue of " inferiority " has not been fundamentally solved .  In addition to insufficient inputs into agriculture by the government , agriculture was restricted by both natural and market risks , and agricultural conditions increasingly deteriorated .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .  
and further enhance the quality of rural grassroots cadres and strengthen the cohesion and combat strength of the rural grassroots party organizations , so as to provide strong and effective ideological and organizational guarantee for making a success of agriculture and rural work .  In carrying out this work it is essential to strictly act in accordance with the principles , methods , and measures laid down by the central authorities , and pay particular attention to getting a good grasp of the following issues .  
Hence , the whole process of this study and education drive must be based on arming the rural grassroots cadres with the important thinking on " three represents " ; in particular , it is essential to strengthen their concept of wholeheartedly serving the people , improve their ability to carry out agricultural restructuring and develop rural economy , strengthen their ability to do mass work well in the new situation , and enhance their consciousness of persistently " grasping things with both hands , and firmly with both hands . "  
In developed countries , the proportion of laborers engaged in agricultural production is less than 5 percent , but it is as high as 50 percent in China . In the vast rural areas , the phenomenon of insufficient employment among the peasants is relatively common , so it is a pressing task to readjust agricultural and rural economic structures and do a good job of transferring surplus rural labor forces .  
They have expressed a common appeal at organs , schools , enterprises , rural areas , newspapers , radio and television programs , and internet websites : They resolutely support President Jiang Zemin'srighteous and stern statements delivered at a meeting with foreign guests.They resolutely support the Chinese Government 's proposal to resolve the issuethrough diplomatic channels in accordance with international law andinternational common practice .  They have resolutely urged the US Government toapologize to the Chinese people and to fully shoulder the responsibility .  
To actively provide effective services for readjusting the rural economic structure and increasing peasants ' income , the vast number of rural grassroots cadres should study in depth the conspicuous contradictions in local agriculture and the rural economic structure , get their ideas into shape , draw up and perfect plans for structural readjustment and economic development in the light of local conditions , and go from village to village , household to household to properly determine measures for readjusting the economic structure and increasing income .  
Zeng Qinghong pointed out : In commanding various rural work with the important thinking of " three represents , " we must devote major efforts to advancing the building of socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and the legal system and safeguarding social stability in the countryside to provide an ideological guarantee and good sociopolitical environment for rural economic and social development .  
It is necessary to unremittingly enhance rural grassroots cadres ' ability to lead the masses in readjusting the economic structure and developing the rural economy , try hard to improve their understanding of policy , enhance their legal sense , and try hard to raise their level and ability in correctly understanding and handling the people 's internal contradictions in the new period .  
To promote the sustained and healthy development of compulsory education in rural areas , we must concentrate on doing several jobs well in the future .  First , double the effort to build junior high schools in the countryside to meet a surge in demand for places in junior high schools as the number of children in the relevant age group hits a peak .  
Fourth , increase support for compulsory education in poor areas in central and west China to promote its development .  Fifth , make sure that the wages of rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid on time .  
At Juncheng Township which was the site of the headquarters of the Jin-Cha-Ji [ Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei ] Military District , Wen Jiabao held cordial talks with veteran fighters of the Eighth Route Army who had taken part in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the mass production movement in Yanan . Wen Jiabao inquired about the living conditions of the local people in details and took part in a discussion meeting with local cadres and masses on current rural work .  
When being told that most of the young workers came from rural areas , Hu Jintao praised them : You are hardworking and enthusiastic , have courage to make innovations , not only guaranteed the quality of construction but also lowered the costs of construction and raised the economic efficiency of the enterprises .  You have devoted your energy and sweat to the construction of the capital .  
To properly accomplish the economic rural restructuring in our country , we must clearly understand and master the regularity in the evolution of agricultural and the rural economic structure , and then seize the key points based on such understanding , thus making advances in an orderly way .  
With the scientific and technological progress and the development of modern education , peasants can master better work skills and richer scientific and general knowledge .  This will provide a major driving force for changing the structure of agriculture and the rural economy .  
If some peasants attain a higher level of scientific and technological knowledge and expertise , get access to more information , master more sophisticated work skills , and know how to run machines for processing farm products , then they will be able to break new ground in the countryside to develop the secondary and tertiary industries , and thus promote the adjustment of the rural production structure .  
Since the start of reform and opening up , especially since the third central conference on work in Tibet , various undertakings have surged forward full of vigor , the outlook of urban and rural areas has changed greatly , and people 's living standards have been raised .  All those are unprecedented in the history of Tibet .  
We must persist in focusing our vision on enhancing the overall qualities of the rural grassroots cadres , on resolving current conspicuous problems in the rural areas , and on safeguarding and developing the interests of the peasants ; in particular , we should do a number of practical things centering on rural economic development , to improve rural production and living conditions and make efforts to increase peasant incomes .  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
To meet the requirements of the present new situation in the work of poverty relief through development and in consideration of the current distribution and the special characteristics of the poverty-stricken population in rural areas , the " Program " has placed the stress of state support on minority-inhabited areas , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and exceptionally impoverished areas in the country 's central and western regions .  
Deepening rural reforms , gaining a good grasp on resolving current prominent issues existing in rural grassroots areas , and protecting and putting the basic interests of the peasants into practice is an important part of educational events on the important ideas of " three represents " that have been launched in various areas .  
At present , every locality , on the basis of summing-up and applying successful experiences , is further implementing the demands of " three represents " for the construction of party grassroots organizations , making efforts to heighten the focus and fighting force of the rural grassroots organizations , comprehensively enhancing the overall quality of rural grassroots cadres , and providing solid and forceful ideological and organizational guarantees so that good work can be done on agricultural and rural tasks under the new conditions that confront us .  
We must reform the way elementary education teaching materials are published and distributed to provide rural primary and middle school students with affordable , suitable textbooks , and we must gradually begin to provide free textbooks to children of families having economic difficulties .  
In the " three represents " study and education activities , Shanxi provincial authorities persisted in doing things that the masses think and wish best to be done , improving things that the masses are most dissatisfied with , and making great efforts to resolve the conspicuous problems in the rural areas , thereby forging a close tie between the cadres and masses , and enabling the rural areas in the entire province to take on an entirely new look .  
In quite a few rural areas in Shanxi Province , there still exist the difficulties in traveling , getting drinking water , going to school , seeing a doctor , and so on at present .  In some villages , the leading groups are still in a state of " weakness , slackness , and paralysis " , and in other villages , the clan forces are interfering with village affairs , local ruffians , tyrants , and other evil forces are rampant , and the situation of public order is very grim .  
A number of village party branches and villagers ' committees led the masses in building roads , drawing water , putting up electrical poles , and running schools one after another .  As a result , the healthy atmosphere has grown and evil tendencies have declined in the rural areas , the ugly phenomena such as " pornography , gambling , and drug-taking " and feudal superstition have been considerably reduced , and the " dirty , chaotic , and poor " appearance of the villages has been changed .  
On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
The central leadership recently decided to adopt a management system " with responsibility being borne by local governments , mainly at the county level , and management being conducted from top to bottom at each administrative level under the unified leadership of the State Council " .  Under this system , the responsibilities for each level from central , to provincial , and then prefecture ( city ) and county are all explicitly defined .  In particular , counties must bear the main responsibility for local rural compulsory education .  
The relevant departments of the State Council should formulate unified fee standards and systems for compulsory education in poor and rural areas .  The standards of fees for textbooks and miscellaneous expenses in other areas should be formulated by provincial people 's governments according to local conditions .  
This conference and the State Council 's " Decision " further emphasized the important status and role of elementary education in our country 's modernization drive , set radical measures for promoting the development of compulsory education in rural areas , make arrangements for advancing the conduct of all-round quality-oriented education in primary and middle schools , and drew a blueprint for the reform and development of elementary education in the 10th Five-Year Plan period .  
In order to strengthen guidance for building rural grass-roots party organizations , the central authorities and relevant departments promulgated in succession the " CPC regulations governing the work of rural grass-roots organizations " , the " opinions of the organization department of the CPC Central Committee on strengthening the building of ranks of rural grass-roots cadres " , the " circular on universally implementing in the rural areas the systems of making village affairs public and managing village affairs in a democratic way " , and other important documents .  
From 1994 to 2000 , all localities throughout the country sent more than 3-million organizational cadres group by group to townships and villages to help them carry out rectification work .  Some 356,000 weak , listless , and paralytic village party branches , backward villages , and poverty-stricken village party branches were rectified , accounting for 48.8 percent of the total number of rural party branches ;  
Nearly 20-million rural cadres and grass-roots cadres in China have mastered one practical technology or two , and among them , 3-million people won primary professional technical titles and 500,000 people won secondary professional technical titles . 
The vast numbers of overseas Chinese and the social organizations have a multifaceted connection with China . We can fully put into play the advantages and preferential conditions of language , customs , as well as relations and rural friendships .  On the basis of mutual advantages , we can open cooperative exchanges in multiple channels and broad territories .  
Since reform , the rural economy has undergone substantial adjustment .  However , the public ownership system still holds a dominant position , with farm output quotas being set for each household , and land , which is the primary means of production for agriculture , continuing to be publicly owned .  
The party has persisted in unfolding the main themes , advocating diversified development of our cultural undertakings , and vigorously developing our literature and art , press and publication , and radio and television undertakings to constantly satisfy our people 's increasing spiritual and cultural demands .  Cultural life of our urban and rural people is rich and colorful .  
We created a revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the rural areas and seizing state power by armed force .  With the people 's army as the backbone , we relied on the people and armed them .  We persisted in educating the officers and men in the party 's theory and program and defeated the better-equipped ferocious domestic and foreign enemies in the prolonged revolutionary wars .  
The party 's policy to get the population rich must be adhered to .  On the basis of economic growth , efforts should be made to increase income for urban and rural residents , constantly improve their living conditions , including food , clothing , housing , transport and daily necessities , improve the social security system , and medical and health facilities , with a view to bettering their life .  
Those advanced collectives and outstanding individuals are from enterprises , rural areas , organizations , schools , scientific research institutes , neighborhoods , military and other fronts .  Their advanced deeds and noble spirit have embodied the character , styles and features of contemporary members of the CPC with clear characteristics of our time .  
The fifth is to establish a perfect rural market economic system and insurance system , draw up rules and regulations for the transactions of agricultural products , and promote the setting up of a pluralistic rural capital market in which agricultural policy banks , rural cooperative banks , commercial banks , and other nongovernmental financial organizations exist side by side .  
On the basis of economic development and social progress , it is necessary to increase the income of urban and rural residents , continuously raise the people 's living standards and life quality , and continuously enable the people to gain better and solid economic , political , and cultural benefits .  
The cadre center of the city military sub-district has exploited its advantage of having many politically steadfast veteran cadres and organized and sent its personnel to veteran cadres ' activity centers in urban and rural areas and to neighborhoods to publicize and explain the thinking of " three-represents , " and to encourage veteran cadres to advocate advanced culture .  
The departments concerned of the governments at all levels , especially the agriculture-related departments , should under the unified leadership of Party committees and in the light of the actual conditions in their own departments and own systems effect active coordination to carry out well the educational activities of studying the important thinking of " three represents " in the rural areas .  
The responsible comrades of the Party committees and governments of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , members of the for the joint conference on the educational activities of studying the important thinking of " three represents " in the rural areas , and others respectively attended the teleconference at branch meeting places in localities concerned .  
We , cadres at the basic level in rural areas , should strengthen our self-cultivation , grasp more knowledge of agricultural science and technology , really " represent the progressive course of the advanced culture " in our villages , and strive to do more practical work for the common people .  
Positive steps should be taken to centralize and hand over the power of managing teachers ' wages to the county authorities in conjunction with measures adopted by the departments concerned to carefully verify the authorized number and total payroll of rural primary and secondary school teachers .  " Special wage fund accounts " should be set up in all counties in accordance with regulations to ensure that rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid fully and on time .  The supervision and management of outlays for teachers ' pay should also be strengthened .  
7 .  Collecting electricity fees which exceed electricity price standards , assessing agricultural people unjustified electricity fees , collecting rural network renovation fees which have not been approved by organizations in charge of prices at provincial level , or collecting fees which exceed those formulated by organizations in charge of prices at provincial level , is classified as an illegal pricing action .  
During the period of democratic revolution , given the special conditions of our country at the time , we had no choice but to base our revolution in the rural areas , so the working class and the peasants formed a close alliance .  As a result , the majority of the members of our Party and the revolutionary troops led by the Party were peasants .  
Zhu Rongji 's dialogue with township and town cadres and middle and primary school headmasters told him that the fees collected by middle and primary schools in some rural areas are much higher than the standard ones set by the State Council 's relevant departments for the compulsory education in poor rural areas .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
We want to basically curb the trend toward worsening ecological damages and environmental pollution on land and in the rivers and the oceans .  We want to begin to improve the urban and rural environmental qualities and tentatively set up a comprehensive ecological and environmental monitoring and warning system .  We want to boost our disaster prevention and reduction capabilities and further raise the level of comprehensive resource utilization .  
As for topic on banking , it will include the positioning of policy-related banks , the consolidation of rural credit cooperatives , how to digest bad debts by asset management companies , market-oriented interest rates , foreign exchange control , further resolving contradictions in the current financial operation , and continuing to solve problems which remain unsolved .  
Investment projects in these areas will include building roads and water and power supply systems in the rural areas , building permanent and semi-permanent housings for herdsmen in a way according to the local situations , intensifying comprehensive agricultural development , and developing the Brahmaputra [ the Yaluzangbu Jiang ] and two other rivers , as well as developing animal husbandry in northern Tibet .  
We must do a good job in resolving problems of the current livelihood and long-term production development for peasants where farmland is bring returned to forest , and support the peasants in developing industries for which there are strong local resources and which meet market needs ; through developing small hydroelectric stations , methane , and so on , we should resolve the problems of the peasants ' fuel and rural energy , prevent indiscriminate tree-felling , and protect the results of returning farmland to forest .  
In view of this , we should make a full use of abundant local animal and plant resources , act in line with the requirement of seeking a unity between economic efficiency and ecological efficiency , and gear ourselves to the needs of the market and rely on scientific and technological advances .  We should intensify the structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy ; vigorously develop a highly efficient production of fine-quality medicinal materials , special foodstuffs , and green foodstuffs ;  
Major changes have already taken place , and are currently taking place , in China 's economic system and in its composition of social classes .  In rural areas , along with the deepening of economic restructuring and the progress of agricultural industrialization , peasants have been organically integrated with the market ; and some of peasants have been separated from land and have engaged themselves in the secondary and tertiary industries , among whom some have joined township and town enterprises , some have become self-employed businessmen , while others have become entrepreneurs of private enterprises .  
The great majority of people in these new social classes are playing an important role in promoting the scientific and technological progress of the country , activating our urban and rural markets , optimizing the allocation of resources , creating more jobs , meeting the diversified demands of our people , and boosting the development of the national economy .  
However , restricted by communications and telecommunication conditions , a vast number of farmers and herdsmen living in the remote mountainous areas and rural areas have been unable to accurately learn in a timely fashion the party 's and state 's principles and policies .  
It was learned that while carrying out the " face-to-face " propaganda activity , the propaganda team members mainly explained the party 's and state 's nationality policies , rural policies , and religious policies and publicized the tremendous changes that had taken place in the local areas since reform and opening up .  Each year , they would revise the themes and key topics of the propaganda activity in light of outstanding problems during different periods .  
to look into and put forward proposals regarding rural economic development , key infrastructure construction , protection and building of the ecological environment , restructuring , resource exploitation , and the arrangement of major projects , and to organize and coordinate the enactment and implementation of plans for returning farmland to forest ( grassland ) ;  
Agricultural Minister Chen Yaobang maintained that the time is ripe for China to carry out strategic adjustments for agriculture and the rural economy .  He said the agricultural restructuring will be market-oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .  
However , we should not employ the traditional , planned approach of building a number of new cities and transfer the residents there step by step .  The genuine question lies in how we should form a more appealing and energetic urban economic development dynamic mechanism that will sufficiently attract the surplus labor power in the rural areas to move into cities by way of marketization .  
He said that China 's entry into the WTO will pose a stern challenge to its traditional agriculture .  If no prompt counter measures are taken in rural areas , he continued , the consequence would be grave .  He stressed the need to take it as " the most important of the important tasks " in rural areas today to meet the challenge in connection with China 's entry into the WTO .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
China has a large population and vast territory , but its per capita output value is less than $ 800 , still a rather big gap from the world 's average level .  Hence , there is a considerably large development space , and the elevation of the urban and rural residents ' consumer structure will produce a prolonged and powerful pulling effect on the economic growth .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .  
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .  
Gao Dezhan said : It is necessary to work intensively to formulate laws for protecting peasants ' rights and interests in connection with the ongoing rural taxation and fee-collection reforms ; and according to the laws , stop the irregular practice of some local governments and departments in collecting fees , imposing fines , and raising funds among peasants in various forms and names .  Thus , the peasant 's legitimate rights and interests can be protected by the legal means , and the burdens imposed on them can be reduced .

Thus , the peasant 's legitimate rights and interests can be protected by the legal means , and the burdens imposed on them can be reduced .  
We should make vigorous efforts to strengthen the building of political power at the grass-roots level in rural areas and turn them into strong fighting bastions to prevent and crack down on the criminal activities in abducting and trafficking in women and children .  
With regard to the grain varieties excluded from the scope of purchases at protective prices , grain consuming enterprises and marketing enterprises will be allowed to purchase grain in the rural areas after the examination and approval of the industrial and commercial administrative departments at prefectural ( city ) or county level .  
In his speech , Jiang Chunyun said : As mass organizations that assist the government in mobilizing people to practice family planning , family planning associations at all levels have , over the past 20 years , effectively carried out work around the basic national policy of family planning under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels .  They have played an increasingly prominent role in grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , poverty relief , community development , spiritual civilization , and international exchanges and cooperation .  
The party 's leading organs or grassroots organizations , the party 's organizations in both the enterprises and the rural areas , and our work in economic , scientific , technological , education , ideological , or political fields should embody in an all-round way the requirement of " three represents . "  
We should deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises ; vigorously develop rural and urban collectives , individual ownership , private ownership , and divers types of other economic ownership ; and groom enterprises into the principal bodies in the development of the western region .  
China 's agricultural and rural economic development has now entered a new stage , in which farm products , particularly grain , have turned from a long-standing shortage to a basic balance of supply with demand and even a surplus in years of bumper harvests , and agricultural development has changed from being subject to resource restraints to being subject to the dual restraints of resources and markets .  
With 10 percent of the global arable land , China has managed to meet the basic needs for food and clothing of its population , which is 22 percent of the global population .  The living standard of the urban and rural population is increasing steadily .  
Since the financial crisis in Asia , China 's economy has experienced severe and complicated tests , but it has still maintained a relatively rapid growth .  In particular , since the beginning of this year , an important turning point has emerged : Economic growth has accelerated , economic results have been considerably improved , the growth in foreign trade has been vigorous , urban and rural consumption has been stable and tended to increase , financial revenue has increased by a big margin , and foreign exchange reserve has continued to increase .  
Second , in the past 20 years , a major factor leading to an increase in China 's total-factor productivity is a large-scale allocation of key production factors resulted from structural changes .  What are particularly important are the transfer of rural labor forces and other resources to township and town enterprises and to the secondary and tertiary industries in cities , as well as a rapid development in non-state-owned economies .  
Vice governors , vice chairmen , and vice mayors from pertinent provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments in charge of agricultural and rural work , comrades in charge of pertinent departments including planning , agriculture , water conservancy , civil affairs , and finance , comrades in charge of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps , and comrades in charge of pertinent departments under the central authorities and the State Council attended the conference .  
We should , laying stress on youngsters and " high-risk groups , " go down to universities as well as middle and primary schools ; to public security lockups , reeducation-through-labor centers , detention centers , and rehabilitation centers ; and to residential districts , rural areas , enterprises , and public institutions to properly conduct preventive education on narcotics through various integrated measures to make every family and individual aware of the matter .  
People remember that at the beginning of the founding of New China , the central government immediately took rigorous measures to launch a nationwide anti-narcotics campaign .  It seized narcotics , banned the planting of opium poppies , closed opium halls , sternly punished narcotics producing and trafficking activities , punished over 80,000 narcotics-related criminal elements , forced 20 million drug addicts to quit drug addiction , and eradicated opium poppy planting in conjunction with rural land reform .  
In the rural areas known for a serious problem of narcotics , we must make earnest efforts to include the ban on drug cultivation , drug trafficking , or drug abuse in both " the village rules and the regulations for farmers . "  We must employ effective measures suited to the local conditions , mobilize to the maximum extent the enthusiasm of the farmers and masses in fighting against drug-related crimes , and help implement the requirements for the narcotics control work at the grassroots level in an all-round way .  
According to a recent survey concerning the income of 40,000 urban and rural households by the State Statistics Bureau 's Urban Social and Economic Survey team , in 1999 , urban residents had an average per capita disposable income of 5854 yuan , for an increase of 7.9 percent over the previous year .  After removing the influence of price factors , the actual increase in income was 9.3 percent , a rate of growth higher than that for the gross domestic product .  
And last year , according to projections from a sample survey of rural and urban residents , less than five percent of wealthy people held nearly half of the nation 's private savings ( of a total national savings amount of over 600 billion yuan ) .  
They should put aside their haughty manner , ignore hardship , go deep with great enthusiasm to rural areas having many difficulties and problems where economic development has been slow and local people have lived in poverty .  They should stay at peasants ' home for a few days to experience the masses ' difficulties and hardships , to understand their aspirations and needs , listen to their voices and opinions , and help them find the answers to some practical problems .  They should be faithful representatives of the masses .  
Third , the legal system for urban and rural planning is unsound and the plans drawn up are lacking in authority .  Some leading cadres have a weak legal concept .  They make decisions as they please and do not act according to plan .  
In advancing the course of urbanization , we must , bearing in mind China 's characteristics as a country with a large population , a high percentage of rural inhabitants and a relative shortage of resources , meet the objective requirements of the process of industrialization and modernization while developing the socialist market economy , rationally plan the pattern , scale and speed of urban development as well as the functions , standards and quality of cities and towns , and take the road of urbanization that suits China 's national conditions .  
We must conscientiously sum up the experience and lessons of our work of urban and rural planning , study and learn from the successful methods of other countries , adhere to the objective laws of urban and rural development , base ourselves on the present situation while bearing in mind future needs , take the interests of all parties concerned into account in making comprehensive plans , and promote the coordinated development of the economy , the society and the environment in accordance with the overall requirements of socialist modernization .  
In the formulation of urban and rural development plans , we must take into account the national economic and social development plan as well as the natural environment , resources , historical and present conditions and future development of various localities in drawing a comprehensive layout .  
As a kind of comprehensive planning , urban and rural planning must properly handle the relations between the part and the whole , the near term and the long tem , needs and possibilities , economic development and social development , urban and rural construction and environmental protection , modernization and protection of historical and cultural relics , and so on .  
The party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at the county ( city ) level are standing at the forefront of reform , development , and stability , have a direct link with the vast numbers of workers , peasants , and intellectuals , and directly assume the important tasks of carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies in the grass roots of the urban and rural areas , which has a direct bearing on the image of the party and government among the masses .  
Its national economy is growing at an annual rate of 9.8 percent , the outlook of its urban and rural areas has improved remarkably , its comprehensive urban service functions are being constantly strengthened , the income of its residents has increased by leaps and bounds and its material and cultural life is becoming richer daily .  
The burdens on peasants are heavy , and the growth of their incomes has slowed down ; the problem of enlivening the rural market has yet to be effectively solved , and close attention should be paid to problems caused by natural agricultural disasters and a drop in grain production and in the prices of farm products .  
Members of the CPC Financial and Economic Committee held : Investments by non-state economic sectors have become an important force for pushing our country 's economic growth forward .  In the first half of the year , the growth of investment by urban and rural collectives and by individual persons picked up to some extent , but the speed was still rather slow .  
Second , we can increase the peasants ' nonagricultural income and also effectively increase agricultural labor productivity by reducing the number of laborers directly engaged in agriculture , switching more rural laborers to secondary and tertiary industries , and also guiding the rational movement of rural laborers to meet the objective needs of the towns and the developed areas .  
The bodies affiliated to the Tibet Science and Technology Association have translated and distributed 108 titles of popular science books which they have written for popularizing scientific knowledge and disseminating practical technology on topics such as scientific field cultivation , stockraising , and prevention and control of disease .  They have also shot Tibetan TV documentaries on advanced agricultural technology and sent them to the rural areas .  
and it is also the requirement of speeding up the improvement of ethnic quality and promoting the joint progress of all minorities .  At present the cultural level of the masses in Tibet is not high , a large proportion of adults in the rural and pastoral areas are illiterate , and it is necessary to rely on and use the Tibetan language to popularize scientific and cultural knowledge , improve labor skills , and enrich the people 's cultural life .  
The " Opinions " demands : We should build a vocational education network on the foundation of existing township and town regular and technical schools and rural applied techniques popularization stations .  In economically comparatively backward regions , we should strive to make junior middle-school graduates generally have one or two job skills that can help them become better off .  
The " Opinions " demands that while maintaining an equal level of fund appropriation between vocational schools and regular schools , all localities should gradually increase the appropriation to the former year by year ; that a proper proportion of the subsidies for urban and rural vocational education appropriated by the central government to various provinces and autonomous regions should be used exclusively in the vocational education for minority nationalities and in ethnic minority regions ;  
Social conditions are complex here , the grassroots organizations are weak , the rural propaganda , ideological , and cultural position has not been built effectively , the work style of certain grassroots cadres is rather simple and crude , cadre-masses relations are relatively tense , and rural development and stability have been affected to some extent .  
Facts show that so long as people 's thinking and understanding are enhanced , the " double thinking " education will be warmly supported by the broad cadres and masses and be generally carried out in the vast urban and rural areas .  
However , because of changes in economic conditions and relevant policies , at present , the operating mechanisms , administrative systems , and formats of services of rural credit cooperatives are not conducive for rural economic development .  The risks that have accumulated over the year have gradually become more prominent .  The key indicators included poor-quality assets , operating difficulties , and high potential risks .  
We should persistently promote economic restructuring amid development and maintain a rapid development amid economic restructuring to comprehensively upgrade our industrial structure , raise the standards and economic efficiency of our agriculture , industry and service trade , make a rational readjustment of the distribution of productive forces , promote a coordinated development of local economy and a beneficial interaction between urban and rural economy , and achieve a sustainable development .  
During the Yanan rectification campaign , Comrade Zhang Wentian seriously conducted self-criticism and dissected himself .  In the spirit of " making up missed lessons , " he went deep into reality , to the basic level , and among the masses to carry out investigation and study and enhance understanding in China 's rural economic and social situation .  
Therefore , experts have pointed out that , at this stage , China 's reform of the social security system will be modest and undertaken at several levels , moving at a steady but uneven pace and accepting some differences between the urban and rural areas , among different regions , and among different ownership systems .  
He said that in recent years , Shandong 's urban and rural outlook has changed dramatically , its economic construction has been impressive , and its people 's lives have clearly improved .  The province 's social undertakings have made comprehensive development , and its party construction has been strengthened .  
There are also , however , a number of rural problems that can not be neglected ; the main ones are that it is difficult for the peasants to increase income , and their burdens are too heavy , while the work style of certain grassroots cadres is simple and crude and they issue compulsory orders , causing bad incidents and mass incidents in certain localities .  
and in the rural areas of the reservoir area , the practice of reclaiming farmland by destroying forests has been strictly banned , farmland on the slopes of less than 25 degrees is gradually transformed into level terraces , and vigorous efforts have been devoted to developing a high-efficiency agriculture and an ecologically sound agriculture .  
although grain output has fallen due to serious drought and adjustment of the sown area , output of various agricultural products such as oil-bearing crops , livestock , aquatic products , fruit , and vegetables has continued to increase ; there has been some rebound in the development speed and economic returns of the township and town enterprises ; the building of rural grassroots organizations , democracy and legal system , and spiritual civilization has been further stepped up ;  
Some grassroots cadres have become seriously divorced from reality and the masses in their work ; they are not good at consulting the masses when doing things , are unable to handle rural contradictions in the new period , and display a simple and crude work style by issuing compulsory orders , arousing discontent among the masses .  
Practicing the system of leaving the reasonable burdens on the peasants unchanged for three years is a major policy decision put forward by the central authorities in light of rural realities , and it must be unswervingly implemented .  
in localities where the revamping has not been completed , the maximum charges for rural electric power will be set at the provincial level , and charges that exceed that maximum must be reduced .  
In the meantime , the living standards of the people in central and western regions have significantly improved ; the number of poor areas and impoverished people has continued to decrease ; and the gap between the actual incomes of urban and rural residents in eastern and western regions has somewhat narrowed .  
The session held that continually improving the material and cultural living standards of people in urban and rural areas is the starting and end point of economic development .  
The key to achieving the continuous growth of peasants ' income lies in vigorously adjusting the agricultural structure , positively broadening the spheres for raising peasants ' income , and increasing the intensity of supporting and protecting agriculture to attain rural economic development on all sides . 
While concentrating our energies on achieving agricultural and rural economic development , we must really have a good grasp of the building of rural grassroots organizations , democratic legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization , maintain social stability in the rural areas , and give impetus to the rural economic and social development in a comprehensive way .  
In light of the new rural situation in the new stage , we should carry out education on the party 's basic line and rural policies , the socialist and collective spirit , the transformation of established traditions and practices , the democratic legal system , as well as science and culture .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that the key to developing agricultural and rural economy and pushing forward agricultural modernization lies in the implementation of the strategy to invigorate agriculture on the strength of science and culture and place the training of qualified personnel in a prominent position .  
The development of rural scientific , technological , and educational undertakings and the enhancement of peasants ' ideological and moral level as well as their scientific and cultural standard are the crucial links of implementing the strategy of invigorating agriculture on the strength of science and education and bringing about the change from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture , and also the important contents and guarantee for building the new socialist rural areas , which are the eager aspirations of the vast number of peasants too .  
Since the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , under the guidance of the party 's agricultural and rural policies , tremendous changes have taken place in the appearance of China 's rural areas , the rural economy has developed in a comprehensive way , peasants ' income has been notably increased , and stability has been maintained in rural society .  
A large number of excellent talented people who have made outstanding contributions have emerged in the course of rural economic and social development .  The Ministry of Personnel and the Ministry of Agriculture decided to commend and award 100 fine examples of them , among whom 10 comrades are conferred the title of " National Fine Talent in Rural Areas " and 90 comrades are awarded a first class merit .  
In the wake of rural economic development , especially with the development of the non-agricultural sectors , those sectors that have attained the highest standard of development have begun to integrate into the urban economy at a faster pace .  This marks the beginning of the transition of the dual , urban-versus-rural , economy from a two-tier to a one-tier developmental pattern , indicating that the dual economy is beginning to merge into a unified economy .  
The party and government have always paid great attention to Chinese peasants ' health standards .  They have initiated and extensively launched " bodybuilding activities for hundreds of millions of peasants , " and guided the broad masses of peasants to carry out physical exercise in an effort to attain healthy and strong physiques , upgrade their working and living conditions , and enhance their spiritual civilization construction .  The " PRC Sports Law " has incorporated athletic activities in rural areas under the legal system .  
The circular finally stressed : We should make vigorous efforts to train and utilize qualified personnel capable of working in both military and civilian posts and this is at once a need of army building and a need for tackling the problem of lack of qualified personnel in the rural areas and promoting rural development as well . 
help demobilized servicemen master modern scientific knowledge about agriculture as well as knowledge about a market economy ; heighten overall quality of demobilized servicemen ; and give full scope to demobilized servicemen 's backbone role in building rural power or organizations at the grassroots level in accordance with requirements laid down in " The Plan for Developing the Work of Training and Utilizing Qualified Personnel Capable of Working in Both Military and Civilian Posts . "  
regard the work of bringing about an industrialized agricultural operation as a major measure for speeding up the strategic structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy , and for promoting the modernization of agriculture ; take bold steps in practice and make active explorations ; and strive to enhance the level of the country 's industrialized agricultural operation .  
Leading enterprises are shouldered with the heavy responsibility of bringing along the growth of peasant households , exploring new markets , making scientific and technological innovations , and boosting the development of the regional economy .  The success or failure of leading enterprises has a direct bearing on our work to improve the economic efficiency of agriculture , to increase the income of our peasants , and to maintain the stability of rural areas .  
This will be conducive not only to improving the peasants ' living standards and stabilizing the situation in the rural areas but also to exploiting rural markets and bringing about a sound interaction between industry and agriculture and between the urban and rural economies and a coordinated development of all of them .  
Investment should be focused on the following areas next year : conducting well the ongoing projects funded by national debts ; accelerating the construction and transformation of agricultural and forestry water control projects , transport and communications , urban infrastructure , environmental protection , and urban and rural power grids and the construction of grain reserve depots directly under the central authorities and affordable and practical housing ; supporting the technological transformation of enterprises and the industrialization of high technology ;  
The Chongqing Municipality has proposed to make efforts to do well four major things like the task of migrating people out of the Three Gorges Reservoir areas , the reform and development of state-owned enterprises , the development of rural economy , and the construction of ecological environments , take an active part in the Big West Development , constantly strengthen its economic strength and city functions , and strive to realize the strategic objective of " building Chongqing into an economic center in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River . "  
In the aspect of agriculture and rural areas , the regional party committee and government have actively readjusted the production structure of agriculture and on the basis of conducting in-depth investigation and study formulated the opinions of the autonomous region about readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure of agricultural products and pushing forward the industrialized operation of agriculture and proposed that farm production should focus on improving quality and uphold the unification of output , quality , structure , and effectiveness .  
During the busiest season of spring plowing and the golden period of industrial production , the party and government leaders of Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region went deep into the rural and pastoral areas and industrial and mining enterprises to help farmers and herdsmen with production activities like spring plowing . resisting disasters and protecting livestock , and preventing diseases and helping enterprises resolve problems confronting them , thus vigorously promoting the economic and social development in the whole region .  
Wen Jiabao says after more than 20 years , China 's rural reform has achieved huge success .  Agriculture 's comprehensive productive capacity has scaled one height after another ; the peasants ' living standard has clearly improved , and the outlook of the rural society has undergone dramatic changes .  
One , we must take a stronger mass viewpoint and forge closer party-masses relations : To uphold the mass viewpoint in rural work , it is vital that we uphold the basic aim of serving the peasants with our hearts and minds , uphold the basic criteria of protecting the peasants ' material interests and respecting the peasants ' democratic rights and privileges , and insist on the basic starting point of raising the peasants ' living standard . 
We must take further steps to integrate ideology with the Central Committee 's plans and requirements , increase understanding , strengthen confidence , take hold of opportunities , take prompt action , and conscientiously launch this round of study and educational activities in order to provide strong ideological and organizational assurances for progress in agricultural , rural , and peasant work .  
Doing a good job with this round of study and educational activities will further raise the quality of base level rural cadres , strengthen the powerful impetus of the cohesiveness of rural grassroots Party organization and fighting effectiveness .  Moreover , it will strengthen the building of rural grassroots organization thereby guaranteeing thorough implementation of the important rural grassroots level organization required by the " three represents " .  
The various Party Committee levels must take firm hold of the beneficial opportunity afforded by this round of study and educational activities , blend the important " three represents " ideological study and education with the frequent work needed for grassroots organization building and work hard to start new aspects of rural grassroots organization building work .  
This association has basically established organizations in urban and rural areas , at the grass roots , in industrial enterprises and institutions , and in places where the transient population is concentrated .  Most associations are capable of giving play to their roles in varying degrees .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
Hence , the increase of peasants ' income in every possible way should be taken as the basic objective of promoting agriculture and rural economic structural adjustment and the fundamental task of agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and placed in a prominent position of the entire economic work .  
Today , people 's consumption in both urban and rural areas has changed from " satisfying the basic needs for food and clothing " to improving the quality of life and seeking all-round individual development .  
All localities must persist in buying the peasants ' surplus grain at protected open prices , attach great importance to lightening the peasants ' burdens , vigorously promote the strategic restructuring of agriculture and rural economy , actively and steadily develop small towns , and achieve relatively rapid increase of peasant incomes.We must push the major development of west China in a thoroughly sound way .  The western development is a major decision of the CPC Central Committee for taking on the overall situation and facing the new century .  
We must uphold economic development as the center , and integrate spiritual civilization construction work with city and rural development work , as well as with business work for all industries and trades .  We must put efforts into raising the ideological and moral quality of people , and also their science and cultural quality , thus providing spiritual motivation and ideological assurance for modernization construction .  
China is a vast country with a population of over 1.2 billion people , and broadcasting has close ties with the thinking , work and life of the masses .  The role of broadcasting can not be overlooked or replaced in the urban and rural areas , especially in the remote agricultural and pastoral areas .  Broadcasting has a great promise and a great future .  
We must vigorously push forward the strategic readjustment of the agriculture structure and the rural economic structure , gear agriculture and the rural economy to the market , rely on science and technology , focus on raising the quality of agriculture products , optimize regional distribution , carry out processing and conversion , and develop industrial management of agriculture .  
Since 2000 , all regions and departments in the country , acting in accordance with the plan of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the requirements they set for agriculture and rural economic development in the new stage , have earnestly carried out the party 's rural policies .  They have strengthened the role of agriculture being the foundation of the national economy , and they exerted great efforts in promoting the restructuring of agriculture and the rural economy .  Agriculture and the rural economy are now developing steadily and have had many positive changes .  
We must profoundly understand the extreme importance of increasing peasants ' incomes , press forward despite the difficulties ahead , and regard restructuring and increasing peasants ' incomes as the central assignments and basic objectives of our rural work at the new stage to be accomplished and attained with firm resolve .  
The meeting stressed : The central authorities ' decision that county and city departments and village cadres across the country must carry out the education program of studying the important thinking concerning the " three represents . "  This is an important policy decision for improving grassroots cadres ' competence and increasing the coherence and militancy of grassroots party organizations in the rural areas under the new situation .  It is also an important move for strengthening and improving the party 's leadership over rural affairs and promoting rural areas ' economic development and social progress .  
The rural market information system will be established and perfected .  The agricultural quality standards and monitoring system will be set up at a quicker pace .  The work of formulating and revising trade standards and local standards for agriculture will be further advanced .  
The reform of rural credit cooperatives should limit to correcting the direction of persistently serving " three aspects of agriculture " ; and should strive to attain the goal of clearly defining relations between ownership and management , improving and perfecting the structure of management by legal persons , guarding against financial risks , changing the management style , reinforcing internal management , and keeping bad debts and operational losses under strict control .  
Enabling peasants to get rich as quickly as possible is not only an important matter concerning reform , development , and stability in the suburbs of the capital , but also an important matter concerning the overall economic and social development in the capital .  Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to this matter , take it as a top priority and the basic objective of the agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and make great efforts to accomplish this task .  
It is necessary to actively study the regularity in the operation of agriculture and the rural economy in the new stage , adopt effective measures according to the local conditions to develop the market-oriented rural economy by bring local advantages into play , raising the quality and efficiency of farming production in suburban areas , and developing agriculture in scope and in depth .  Thus income can be increased in the process of strategic economic restructuring .  
Through the implementation of the party 's rural policies and in-depth reforms , we should effectively protect , arouse , and give play to the initiative of the peasants .  This is the main driving force for increasing their income .  At the same time , the advantageous technological and intelligent conditions in the capital should be brought into full play ;  
Municipal , district , county , township and town governments and all social circles should continue to increase the effectiveness of supporting and protecting agriculture .  In particular , while changing the backward conditions of the rural infrastructure facilities and improving the farming production conditions , it is necessary to give policy guidance to the peasants , encouraging them to become main investors and operators in the farming industry , and thus enlivening the rural economy as a whole .  
The theme of the current meeting is to energetically push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution and accelerate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency in a bid to provide scientific and technological support to the agricultural and rural economic development in the new stage .  
On the one hand , China 's agricultural and rural economy has entered a new stage , as agricultural development has changed from the restriction by resources in the past to the dual restriction by resources and markets ; the problems of irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low agricultural comprehensive effectiveness , slow growth of peasants ' income , and so on are increasingly conspicuous , which have set new and higher demands on agricultural scientific and technological development .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
In the coming 10 to 15 years , we must strive by every possible means to resolve the scientific and technological problems in terms of optimizing agricultural structure , heightening agricultural efficiency , improving rural ecological environment , augmenting international competitive power , and so on to facilitate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency .  
It means developing the production of quality farm produce , quickening the pace of developing the processing industry for farm produce , promoting agricultural industrialized operation , optimizing agricultural and rural economic structure , heightening the scientific and cultural level of the vast number of peasants , and broadening the channels to increase peasants ' income through furthering the scientific and technological advancement .  
Agricultural development has changed from the resource constraint of the past to the dual constraint of resources and market ; problems such as irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low comprehensive returns on agriculture , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes are becoming more conspicuous by the day , and these set new and still higher demands on the development of agricultural science and technology .  
We must vigorously propagate and popularize scientific knowledge , scientific thinking , and scientific methods ; guide the masses of cadres in building scientific , civilized , and healthy social trends and fine lifestyles ; and constantly meet the growing cultural needs of the masses of peasants , thereby promoting the two civilizations in the rural area .  
Under the current situation in which the standard of China 's rural productive forces is fairly low , it is difficult to carry out agricultural scientific research and development without government support .  
It has been learned that , despite that poverty relief and development efforts made over the last few years have noticeably alleviated the poverty and backward situations in the vast poor rural areas and noticeably increased incomes of the poverty population , the average income of the poorest population in rural areas is still less than one third of the per capita income of peasants of the country .  Besides , the gap of incomes of peasants in developed and poor regions not only has not narrowed , but , on the contrary , has further widened .  
Beginning in 2000 , the task will be pressing and arduous to continue to ensure sufficient food and clothing for the low-income populations living in poor rural areas who have not had sufficient food and clothing and those who have initially but not stably had sufficient food and clothing , and for the people living in poverty mainly in old revolutionary areas , minority nationality areas , pastoral areas , frontier areas , and other particularly poor areas ; and the task of preserving the results of poverty relief and development will be as pressing and arduous .  
If there is a long-term drop off in grain prices , the readjustment of the agricultural structure will be delayed , the shift of the surplus rural workforce will be impeded , and it will be impossible to boost the income of the farmers , which may result in a setback to the enthusiasm of the farmers and shake the agricultural foundation , thus jeopardizing the entire national economy .  
The party committees at all levels should fully understand the momentous and far-reaching significance of the current " study and education " activities , further integrate their thinking with the major policy decisions of the central authorities , use the idea of " three represents " to lead and assume overall responsibility for the agricultural and rural work , strengthen leadership , organize the work carefully , seek actual results , and have a good and firm grasp of the " study and education " activities conscientiously .  
- - Comprehensively implementing the strategy of industrializing the agricultural operation , improving the processing and transformation level of agricultural products , and enhancing the extension effect of agriculture .  The province will actively spread new operational forms in its rural areas , such as linking industrial companies with farming households and introducing an orders-based agriculture ;  
In medium-sized and small cities and small towns , by developing various kinds of industrial zones producing local specialty products , we will actively induce and centralize township and town enterprises to establish processing , construction , and service industry with local special flavor .  We will use industrial centralization and development as a driving force to prompt rural population to migrate to urban areas in a reasonable and orderly manner .  
However , the realization of socialist modernization in rural areas can not rely on empty talk or idle waiting , but can only rely on our painstaking and unswerving efforts with innovations and efficiency .  Only by making such efforts can we usher in a bright future .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : Since last year , a number of counties and cities in Anhui Province and other provinces and autonomous regions have carried out the trial reform of taxes and charges in rural areas in accordance with the arrangements made by the party Central Committee and the State Council , and have achieved initial good results .  First , the peasants ' burdens have been reduced by a great extent and the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " has been effectively curtailed .  
The reform policy is to tackle the current actual situation in rural areas , and is supported by the broad masses of peasants and cadres at the grassroots level .  It is a policy to fundamentally solve the problem of the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " in rural areas , to reduce the peasants ' burdens , and to protect and whip up the peasants ' enthusiasm for production .  
We should guarantee the normal operation of political power at the grassroots level and establish a supervising and managing system for the reduction of peasants ' burdens .  We should continue to straighten up wanton collection of fees by middle and primary schools in rural areas , wanton collection of water and power charges in rural areas , apportioning of fees for newspaper , and demanding money and things for activities in order to achieve certain targets .  
Responsible persons of various provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the central authorities , and the Xinjiang Production-Construction Corps ; responsible persons of concerned ministries and departments of the party Central Committee , the National People 's Congress and the State Council ; and responsible persons of offices of leading groups of financial and agricultural departments and commissions of various provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities for the reform of taxes and charges in rural areas attended the meeting .  
According to Anhui province 's statistics , since the fee-to-tax reform was implemented , the agricultural two taxes and their attachments collected by the province were reduced 23.6 percent from what was collected in agricultural tax , agricultural unique product tax , township joint planning and village withdrawals before the reform was implemented .  Implementing this reform , combined with abolition of the butchery tax and rural educational fundraising raising , meant the total tax and fee burden for farmers dropped by 31 percent .  
Since opening and reform were implemented , China 's rural operating system has undergone fundamental changes , but administrative system reform has lagged behind , meaning it could not meet the demands of rural market economic development .  
At the same time , it encourages grassroots authorities in the countryside to alter their functions as development of the socialist market economy demands .  It has downsized township institutions and staff , promoted village self-administration , improved the rural administrative system , and made the rural superstructure better fit the changed economic foundation .  
The key to success for rural fee-to-tax is whether we can carry out the central government 's policy well from the view point of implementation ; and the core of this is strictly assessing and determining farmers ' burden in a fair and rational way in accordance with policy regulations , for the ultimate goal of the reform is to practically cut down farmers ' burden .  
A national forum for the members of the first batch of supervision and inspection groups concerning study and education activity of the important thinking of the " three represents " in rural areas has just concluded today .  This reporter has learned from the forum that upon the approval of central leading comrades , the first batch of six supervision and inspection groups , which are respectively headed by provincial-level veteran comrades , will soon leave for 12 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities to supervise and inspect the progress of the study and education activity there .  
In particular , we must regard increasing the peasants ' income as the focus of agricultural and rural work , as the main task to tackle in developing the rural economy , and as an important yardstick to measure the results of the " three represents " [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] study and education activities in rural areas .  
In conducting such activities , we must have our eyes on improving the overall quality of the broad masses of rural grass-roots cadres , on solving existing conspicuous problems in rural areas , and on safeguarding and increasing the fundamental interests of the broad masses of peasants .  Such study and education must be closely linked with promoting rural work .  
The opera displayed the importance and urgency of changing cadres ' work styles , making coherent the people 's feelings , and straightening out the party styles and social atmosphere in the new period .  The opera was simple and vivid with a touching story .  It had strong artistic influence and educational effect , and was a very strongly practical drama for implementing education in party styles and honest administration in grass-roots rural areas .  
It is necessary to strengthening public health work in rural areas , more effectively prevent and control the incidence of major diseases , infectious diseases , and endemic diseases .  In particular , public health guarantee capacities in the western part of the country must be enhanced .  Reforms of the medical insurance system for urban workers , institutional reforms of the medical institutions , and the reform of the pharmacy circulation system should all be further advanced actively .  
Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .  As a result of the insufficient financial input in rural public health undertakings , many grass-roots hospitals and clinics remain in very poor conditions .  Buildings are simple and crude ;  
equipment is obsolete and outmoded ; technical and professional human resources are insufficient .  The unreasonable distribution of public health resources in rural areas has affected the development of public health undertakings in the vast countryside .  
the layout of rural medical and health care institutions will be readjusted , with the current layout based on administrative regional division being changed ; all existing medical and health care facilities will be put under unified management in the whole trade ; in the same township , the health care station and the guiding station for family planning can share resources .  
The lawbreaking and illegal activities of making and selling counterfeit and inferior medicines have not been effectively checked and prevented .  Some illegal drugs which have been banned are still being sold in fair markets , and may directly threaten the safety of the consumers , especially the masses in rural areas .  
The motion was advanced by the 114 deputies of the Anhui delegation to the NPC session .  It holds that , at this critical moment when tax for fees reform and regulating funds for public undertakings in rural areas will be fully carried out , it is imperative to establish a system for sharing compulsory education funds between the central and local authorities according to a certain proportion in order to prevent peasants ' excessive burden and consolidate the results of the trial of tax for fees reform at selected places .  
We should strive to maintain social stability by intensifying our efforts at the comprehensive improvement of public order in the urban and rural areas and strike hard at gangster forces and all kinds of unlawful practices and crimes .  
Delegate Yao Qiong , Chairwoman of the Women 's Federation from the Daozhengelao minority autonomous county , proposed expansion of educational forces on behalf of national minorities in impoverished areas , increasing support for a new round of development in the area of poverty relief , strengthening cadre training at basic levels in rural areas , and promoting the overall development of rural economies .  
He says : Anhui and some other local areas have been quite successful in launching pilot projects of reforming their tax and fee collection systems .  The pilot projects have set the financial obligations for the peasants , the state , and the collectives ; effectively reduced the peasants ' burdens , and stopped the collection of unwarranted levies , fines , and obligations in the rural areas .  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " sums up our nation 's abundant practical economic experience , identifies the major problems to be resolved as well as the major areas for development , and proposes a direction in which to work and corresponding policy measures .  For example , with respect to strengthening the basic position of agriculture and promoting the comprehensive development of the rural economy , the ' outline ' makes 6 policy decisions : Protect and improve grain production capacity ; expand areas in which rural people can increase their income ;  
In urban areas , a sound old-age security system needs to be established , with basic old-age insurance , basic medical insurance , business insurance , social relief , social welfare , and mutual social aid as its major contents .  As for rural areas , they are required to carry out the work towards the aged mainly in the form of family-based old-age care ;  
Making agricultural adjustment is not to decide which crops should be emphasized and which crops should be less emphasized .  We should raise the quality of agricultural products in an all-round way , improve geographical layout , and realize sustained development and a coordinated development between urban and rural areas .  
In his speech , peasant representative Wang Guangping from Dongxing Village , Dongxing Township , Dingyuan County , said : The rural tax and fee reforms have ensured that the burdens on peasants are reduced and standardized the behavior of tax collection and management in rural areas .  Peasants are genuinely happy about this .  We hope this policy , which benefits the people , will be kept consistent and be continuously perfected , with supporting policies introduced .  
Nine hundred million of the total of over 1.2 billion people are in the rural areas .  The key to expanding domestic demand lies in developing the rural market , trying by every possible means to increase the peasants ' income , and turning the potential purchasing power in rural areas into actual purchasing power .  
Lu Ming spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association : From the high plane of the modernization program , we should reexamine the importance of the question of agriculture , rural areas , and peasants at the current stage , draft agricultural policies , and coordinate other policies in light of the requirements of laying stress on , supporting , and developing agriculture .  
He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
While attending the discussion meeting of the Jilin delegation , Wen Jiabao , member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council , said that great importance must be attached to the issue of peasants ' income .  It is necessary to try by all possible means to increase peasants ' income , and take this as the basic objective of doing a good job in the agricultural and rural work in the new stage and put this in a prominent position in the economic work as a whole .  
It calls for acting in line with the requirements of the " three represents , " attaching prime importance to resolving relevant issues related to people 's immediate interests , including striving to increase the incomes of urban and rural residents , especially low-income people in the urban areas and the incomes of peasants .  It also calls for expanding employment , improving the social security system , optimizing the consumption environment , raising the quality of living , and resolving the food and clothing problems of those people who are still living in poverty .  
Wu Minghui said that an obvious feature of the current system of residence registration , which was developed under the planned economy , especially the system of the unified purchase and marketing of grain , is that it totally separates the urban population from the rural population .  The demarcation is very distinct .  
The main reasons for China to increase its national defense spending this year is to ensure that the living standard of the servicemen will improve simultaneously with social and economic development and with the increase in the average income of urban and rural residents , and to meet the needs of the modernization of national defense and the reform of the military management structure .  
" Not only will it ease the pressure originating from the surplus of rural labor force , help raise the peasants ' income , divert a large number of redundant laborers to the secondary and tertiary industries , and strongly expedite agricultural restructuring , but also it will check haphazard influx of rural population into large cities , promote economic development , and forward urbanization . "  
If we have steady agricultural development , peasants will live in happiness and rural areas will be prosperous .  If such being the case , the state will enjoy a stable situation and the world will be peaceful .  China 's history has proven this over the past several thousand years .  
Peng Peiyun pointed out : Following the tax-for-fees reform , surcharge for education and social collection of funds have been canceled .  The income of township and town finance has decreased , and the new agricultural tax has not clearly stipulated the proportion of tax for compulsory education in rural areas .  The system of financial transfer by financial department at the higher level also has not been properly established .  
We should deepen reform of credit associations in rural areas and improve financial services .  We should continue the work of helping poor areas through development and formulate new plans to help poor areas .  We should lay stress on helping poor people in central and western regions resided by minority people , in old revolutionary base areas , and in border and especially poor areas .  
We should continue to increase investment in education , ensure the basic need in promoting compulsory education in rural areas , support the construction of foundation facilities for schools of higher learning , develop middle and high level professional education , strengthen vocational and technical training , and encourage people in the society to run schools .  
Promoting comprehensive economic and social development , properly building the material and spiritual civilizations , making efforts to promote the coordinated development of the urban and rural areas and of different regions , keeping economic development , population , resources , and the environment in line , and bringing about sustainable economic and social development are the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , are important expression of our party 's " three represents " thinking , and are also the direction for the process of socialist modernization which we must firmly grasp .  
We should make it our objective to increase the income of urban and rural population and constantly meet the people 's material and cultural needs , and vigorously promote the comprehensive development of the national economy and social undertakings .  
Third , the urban and rural structure will be adjusted , the process of urbanization will be advanced steadily and positively , the rate of urbanization in the whole province will be raised to a level close to the national average .  
When the first NPC was called , there were only four special committees .  And when the Ninth NPC was called , the number of special committees was already increased to nine unfolding works in the areas of education , science , culture and public health , law , internal and judicial affairs , nationalities , environmental and resources protection , finance and economy , overseas Chinese affairs , foreign affairs , agriculture and rural affairs in accordance with law and the wishes of the people .  
As stressed at the session , strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the economy and increasing the farmers ' income must be considered as economic tasks of prime importance .  It is imperative to speed up agricultural and rural economic restructuring , energetically promote the industrialized operation of agriculture , vigorously conduct rural reforms in all fields , truly reduce the burdens on farmers , continue the help-the-poor work in rural areas , and take positive and steady steps to proceed with the urbanization program .  
Zeng Qinghong stressed : We must push forward in depth the study and education activity on the important thinking of " three represents " in rural areas , strive to meet the prescribed targets in real terms , and further make people 's ideological understanding on the activity conform to the requirements of the central authorities .  
Wen Jiabao went down to the fields to observe the way crops sown in late autumn were growing and the preparations for plowing and sowing of crops in the spring ; visited peasant households to acquainted himself with the livelihood of the masses ; and had discussions with cadres at grassroots level and farmers to study measures of restructuring agriculture , developing the rural economy , and increasing farmers ' income .  
He pointed out : Taking agricultural restructuring and the increase of farmers ' income as the basic target and major task of the current agricultural and rural economic work is a correct policy decision made by the central authorities after having made a thorough analysis of the situation of agriculture and the rural economy in the new period .  Restructuring agriculture and the rural economy is not only an important way to increase farmers ' income but also a strategic measure to comprehensively improve the overall quality and efficiency of agriculture and carry out agricultural modernization .  
In accordance with the unified plans of the central authorities regarding the launching in the rural areas of in-depth educational activities based on the important " three represents " idea , we must organize grass-roots cadres in studying and understanding the central authorities ' policies concerning the reduction of the burden on peasants , enhance their policy awareness and legal mindedness , improve their work style , and boost their initiative in implementing the policies .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that the important " three represents " idea study and education activities being launched among county ( city ) departmental cadres and town and village cadres throughout the country is a major move aimed at raising the quality of grass-roots cadres in rural areas , enhancing the rally force and fighting capacity of grass-roots party organizations in rural areas , and promoting social and economic development in rural areas under the new situation .  
First , it is necessary to link such activities with developing the rural economy and guiding farmers to free themselves from poverty and achieve a better-off level of moderate prosperity .  It is necessary to firmly instill grass-roots cadres in rural areas with the idea of taking economic development as the central task and to make them concentrate their energy on developing the rural economy and on raising farmers ' incomes .  
Second , it is necessary to link such activities with the promotion of spiritual civilization in rural areas , to heighten in an all-round way the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the masses of cadres and people in rural areas , and to provide economic and social development in rural areas with an ideological guarantee , spiritual motive force , and intellectual support .  
In North District , the Social Welfare Department and North District Office will continue to foster a close and cordial relationship at district level with various rural committees and to provide briefings about various welfare services to them and pass on to rural residents information on welfare services through the relationship network built up by the villagers with residents in remote areas .  
The Government 's policy objective on the environmental well-being of the community is to improve our urban , rural and marine surroundings , conserve our natural heritage , and optimise the use of resources and goods so as to reduce pollution and waste and promote health and the enjoyment of our living environment .  
On rural elections , Mr Lan said a Government working group is now looking at how current practices can be improved taking into account the dual objective of balancing traditional rural interests and the need for open , fair and clean elections .  
At present , China is making strategic readjustment to its economic structure and speeding up the readjustment of its industrial setup , regional structure , urban and rural structure and ownership composition .  China has given prominence to the development of science , technology and education , accelerated the informatization of national economic and social progress , strengthened environmental protection , expedited township development and improved public service system .  
" In order to strike a proper balance between the operational needs of the trade and the importance for avoiding adverse environmental impacts and nuisances of such uses to the nearby residents , the Board has formulated a strategy for tackling issues related to the consideration of applications for temporary open storage and port back-up uses in the rural New Territories , " the spokesman explained .  
Regarding the dispatching of Department of Health 's mobile dispensaries , floating clinics and flying doctors to provide medical services to residents living on outlying islands and certain remote areas in the rural parts of the territory , will the Government inform this Council :  
After more than 20 years ' development , with the provision of a total of nine hectares of land by reclamation or site formation , public facilities including a indoor sports centre , waterfront park , fire station , rural public housing estate , market complex , waterfront promenade and sewage treatment plant are built to greatly improve the quality of life of the local residents .  
Agricultural aid of the government has totaled NT $ 2,500 million in the last two and a half years . Another NT $ 1,480 million has been loaned to farmers for modernization projects . With agriculture booming , public and private institutions have been encouraged to provide another NT $ 2,100 million worth of investment in the rural economy .  
Story of a Small Town Mountains covered with fir woods and bamboo groves , frequently shrouded by mists and sharply divided by the sparkling Chingshui River , provide an idyllic setting for Tsaoling Village in central Taiwan . Its pastoral people , who earn their living through a resourceful array of specialized products , help further to induce an atmosphere of rural peace .  
Sometimes an old grandma can be seen sitting by a cradle humming a lullaby . The leisurely and pleasant air of rural villages in old China can still be sensed here . Sad to say , the rooms in the right wing between the fourth and fifth courts became so dilapidated that they were torn down a few years ago , and replaced by a two story western-style building .  
One is Oluanpi , a national park ; another is the small Maobitou peninsula . Situated across from a rural community , far from the hustle-and-bustle of the big cities , a very exotic tropical paradise overlooks the ocean : dark blue water for as far as the eye can see . A light blue sky and golden sand reflect the glimmer of the setting sun , a round ball of crimson hovering over the horizon .  
Outside Kaohsiung , in the southern part of Taiwan , in a rural , sleepy farming community , hidden amid rice paddies is a pleasant but imposing structure surrounded on all sides by a high wall .  
The rapid reduction in the sweet potato crop reflects two phenomena : First , the movement of the rural population to the cities . Even though the sweet potato does not require much care , its planting and harvesting still require lots of manpower . Second , although many poor-land fields were left unused , in rice-growing areas some paddy fields are used for both rice and sweet potatoes to make the most of natural conditions . Sweet potatoes can be grown between the two growing periods of paddy rice , getting full use out of a field .  
This combination of rivers and mountains lends a lovely rural ambience to the region . Ch'en Cheng-chang , town magistrate points out that bamboo thrives in warm , humid areas and Chushan , with its average elevation of 1000 meters and its southwest exposure , which ensures ample yearly rainfall totals , is ideal for successful bamboo growth .  
Puppet theatre has experienced difficult times as of late . A rural art , it lost much of its audience in the tremendous urbanization of the past twenty years . In addition , being educated has come to mean being Westernized for many people , leaving them to shun traditional Chinese art .  
The conference summarized its discussions in 11 conclusions , aimed at an ideal agricultural system including : a structure for agricultural policy with comprehensive powers , strong and capable farmers ' organizations , autonomous price regulation , stable agriculture profits , moderate trade protection , reasonable prices for inputs , continuous use of agriculture resources , a low-pollution environment , stable growth in agriculture , hygienic and safe agricultural products , and safe and healthy rural villages .  
Specialists commonly agree that the solution lies in combining small farms into large ones to achieve economies of scale and in promotion of planned production and sales , to economically utilize agricultural resources . Moreover , modernized construction should be strengthened in the rural areas to build villages with the potential to meet the needs of the time . This will solve problems of the farming population and the farming villages simultaneously . (  
In recent years it has become the custom to erect museums , galleries , and exhibition halls through private subsidy and ownership as opposed to setting up state-run facilities . Bands , dance troupes , orchestras , and puppet shows will continue to spring up and flourish at an astonishing pace . A prominent feature of our program for the future is the construction of libraries and audio-visual centers for every township and every rural district or village .  
Beautification of the environment , and urban and rural planning will receive toppriority attention . These newly planned community districts and zones will spring up everywhere and improve the quality of everyday existence . New edifices will include traditional Chinese architectural features , and space for outdoor activities will also be provided for the members of each community , such as playgrounds , parks , and gardens .  
We never thought we would buy a house in Hsichih , " says Hsiung Shu-hua , a public relations employee at Philips . She grew up in Hsichih but the place always seemed a bit of a backwater , awkward to get to and limited by its traditional rural economy , so when she got married three years ago she and her husband moved out to rented accommodation in Neihu .  
Modern Taiwan 's rural hinterland could hardly be expected to provide ethical regeneration and social harmony as it used to in the past , because concentration of the population in cities is already an established trend . But rural culture 's essential spiritual values can provide the basis for cultural development .  
In a commercialized society , with temple meetings in south Taiwan increasingly large , yi-chen are still not without a way out to survive . But with the gradual outmigration of the rural population , the trend of waxing and waning among community and professional chen can not , it seems , be altered .  
Altogether , there are probably no more than ten similar local drama troupes . Participants mostly have a sense that cultural development between the cities and the rural areas is too imbalanced : In Taipei arts groups are concentrated together and there are abundant performing arts . But elsewhere , after the powerful assault of the mass media , now everyone is bolted in front of the TV watching the same old TV personalities and plots that have nothing to do with their daily lives . Where have those dramas that reflect local life gone to ? "  
The maintenance of the basic rural village structure , plus leisure time and extra cash that people are willing to spend on cultural activities , is just like Taiwan shortly after retrocession , before any electronic or television media had become widespread , when local opera was definitely in its prime .  
In Fukienese rural villages , besides celebrations of the gods which have economic benefits in mind , state-sponsored dramatic operations have the responsibility of spreading the official line , as for example in modern dramas encouraging birth control or extolling some new positive and condemning the corresponding negative . These accompany the traditionally-costumed Hsiang Opera and are performed everywhere in turn .  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
But even though high-level medical technology ca n't be provided on location in these remote districts , where populations number in the hundreds , combined medical assistance should be sufficient , through telemedicine , mobile medical care , and public-sponsored rural physician visitation services , all of which have been carried out for many years , as well as the backup system of offshore military medical services .  
A woman who held a master 's degree married a husband who came from the rural south . On the first day of the marriage , in the kitchen of her motherinlaw 's rustic house , she faced a mountain of dirty dishes left behind by the visiting guests and relatives . She washed dishes until she cried .  
" From the 1960s and 70s , economic development began to affect Hualien , and Ami tribal society began to be ' marginalized . ' Songs such as this , which describe the emotional upheaval among tribespeople in a period of change , still preserve the typical rural color of Ami singing , but they also have acquired a touch of melancholy , " says Wu Ming-yi , who teaches at Yu Shan Theological College in Hualien , and who has been studying the changes in Ami songs for many years .  
To fulfill an election promise to eliminate garbage from Taoyuan 's cities , County Executive Annette Lu has , first of all , applied to the EPA to build two inter-area incinerators which would be operational in four years . Secondly , she has asked 13 cities , townships and rural townships to build small-scale sanitary landfills , and permitted and aided towns in establishing small-scale incinerators and local dumps , which can serve as stop-gap measures before the main incinerators are built .  
Liou has advertised the " baby oil series " as being free of complex or obscure meaning , taking it on frequent tours to rural areas in an effort to bridge the gap with audiences and make modern dance more accessible to the average person .  
In his thinking , the peasants have no month of rest and the life of the fields is one of exhausting hard labor . Yet he also saw the pleasure of rural life , when the peasants have finished work and " the children who were picking melons laugh and wash their feet at the water 's edge as the sun goes down , telling outrageous stories before the evening wind picks up . " This was a simple kind of leisure that the sophisticated literati were unable to appreciate .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
The next six provincial governors were all Taiwanese . During their terms in office , they put top priority on : developing local infrastructure ; providing better social services for workers engaged in agriculture , industry , and fisheries ; expanding the social safety net ; cleaning up local environments ; building planned communities ; accelerating rural development ; implementing the second phase of rural land reform ; providing full health insurance benefits for farmers ; reorganizing agricultural production ; and encouraging the use of more sophisticated agricultural technology .  
Moreover , in cities , interpersonal relations are often fluid and remote , and an untraditional woman is not likely to meet as much outside pressure . However , on the margins of the city or in the countryside , because interpersonal relations are so close , the conservativeness of couples , in-laws , neighbors , and colleagues creates a dense net . There will be tremendous resistance to any change in a marital relationship . Women in rural areas need to resolve these issues .  
After we passed through the city of Konosu , the scenery became very rural , with rice fields on either side of the road . Farmhouses dotted the landscape , rice seedlings were planted in neat rows in flooded paddies , wisteria vines were sprouting their first tender green leaves of spring , and eager tips of grass were just beginning to push up through the sleepy spring soil .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
Today 's senior citizens laid the foundation upon which Taiwan 's current success was built , but they 've been abandoned in these rural communities . We , their juniors , are an ungrateful generation . Q : Do you feel that transplanting the elderly to the city is a better solution ?  
The programming for these time slots was low-budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in Taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters-in-law and the like , or family comedies . Thus , for a long time , Taiwanese drama gave people the impression of being lowbrow .  
In China , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production . As this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year . Thus New Year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle .  
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .  
With their relatively low moisture content , the woody structure of Formosan acacias possess just the right degree of firmness , not at all like the damp and spongy wood of the Okinawa pine or the gunpowder trees commonly seen in rural northern Taiwan . The lower moisture content makes the heartwood of the acacia resistant to parasitic insects , allowing it to remain standing long after the tree 's outer layers have rotted away .  
Not the first time Each of these emerging bands has a style of its own , but they also have in common a way of combining homegrown and western styles of music . For example , Luan Tan 's beiguan-derived music alludes to the communal rural spirit of earlier times , something which is being rediscovered in the extra-curricular life of today 's students . It is a collective , pluralist mode of creation which contrasts starkly with the staleness of mainstream pop and illuminates new possibilities for music in Taiwan .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
The story is much the same when it comes to birds . Surveys of foreign starlings and mynas , also by TESRI , identified 13 non-native members of the family Sturnidae living wild in Taiwan , mainly escaped or released pets and their offspring . " White-vented mynas and common mynas have been recorded in over a third of Taiwan 's 361 urban townships , rural townships and city districts , " says a survey report by Lin Ruey-shing of TESRI .  
While he dedicated his life 's work to economic and technological development , he did not forget the importance of raising educational standards , narrowing the gap between urban and rural citizens and controlling population growth , and these were not overlooked in the promotion of his new ideas .  
During the war against Japan , Taiwanese Opera was prohibited on the mainland due to the fact that the land of its birth , Taiwan , was under Japanese colonial rule . Sai Yue-chin borrowed money left and right in order to flee to a rural inland area , where she performed on stage by night . The shows lasted until dawn , and the tough schedule brought on a serious gastric ailment for the frail Sai .  
This is a song of Kukeng Rural Township , written by a local resident . It accompanies newlyweds and couples from the rural township celebrating their golden and diamond anniversaries as they walk through a tunnel of densely packed foliage , symbolizing the continual revitalization of romance .  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
WTO membership will be a blow to many agricultural counties , but in recent years tourist farms have sprouted up . These new operations offer rural residents a new way to make a living by offering visitors a taste of specialty products and unique local cultural attractions . Many novel ideas , like liquor-producing towns , and farming villages specializing in vanilla and other local crops , have appeared .  
Like most young people , Robert Huang did n't figure he 'd be making it monstrously big in business , but opportunity came knocking when a group of friends from the Tunghai University department of architecture decided to found an architecture firm and build a residential division where people would be able to establish the close personal ties typical of traditional rural communities while still enjoying all the conveniences of modern apartment life .  
In the late 1960s and early ' 70s , rapid economic develop-ment in Japan triggered a lopsided concentration of population and infrastructure in that country 's urban areas , and a serious decline of rural towns and villages , as people flocked to the cities and misguided development schemes wrought havoc left and right . At the same time , the signing of a US-Japan security treaty spawned protests throughout the 1960s by university students concerned about the possibility of Japan returning to its former militarism .  
The little rural township of Luku , located in Nantou County , has a population of only 20,000 or so . Fifty-nine percent of the people are tea farmers . It is estimated that Nantou County accounts for one-third of the 18,000 hectares of land in Taiwan devoted to tea plantations , with Luku accounting for one half of Nantou 's total . Whether measured by cultivated area or production volume , Luku is the largest single tea-producing township in Taiwan .  
Ever curious about foreigners , the rural children were always bashful . In their eyes , in which black and white were so finely contrasted , and in their candid smiles , you could see the hope and future of their country . However , when they opened their mouths , it always made me feel uneasy , for they would always say , " Amiga !  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .  
In a society where " information equals power , " it is apparent that the gulfs between urban and rural , rich and poor will be increasingly difficult to traverse . Disparities in digital technology accordingly will become one of the world 's most controversial issues .  
In an effort to reduce the gap between rural and urban areas , and to respond concretely to cultural demand in counties and small cities , the Government Information Office ( GIO ) broke with a 26-year tradition and this year moved the Golden Tripod Awards ceremony out of Taipei City for the first time . It was held in Ilan County , where it was able to tap into local cultural characteristics and displayed a definite Lanyang Plain flavor .  
The Estate is not the only structure closely connected to the history of Wufeng to be in this condition . The Wan Fo Temple , a busy religious center that was located in the mountains behind the provincial assembly building , was once the largest Buddhist monastery and temple complex in the entire rural township . Its most distinctive feature was a 20-meter tall golden statue of Baisajyagurvaiduryaprabhasa in a seated position . Though the statue itself is still intact , the remainder of the structure was eradicated by the earthquake .  
In order to better understand the English-language education conundrum facing elementary schools throughout Taiwan , Control Yuan members Lu Hsi-mu , Lin Shih-chi , and Yin Shih-hao compiled an investigative report entitled " Problems in Elementary School English Education " at the close of last year . In it they discovered that rural schools were quite often unable to hire accredited English instructors .  
Although agriculture in Taiwan is generally on the decline and rural areas have been losing their young people , many of Kungkuan 's native sons and daughters who had left to pursue their educations or careers have recently been returning . In the same fields that their fathers and grandfathers tilled , they are now constructing European-style farms , traditional Hakka homesteads , and bright , modern farming villas . Apart from attracting tourists , they are recreating Kungkuan for themselves .  
They improvised and created as they progressed , though they modestly refuse to claim any great brilliance about the whole thing : " It 's just the basic instinct for working with your hands that most people who grow up on the farm have . " But there is something special about the work of these hardy rural folk . In comparison with the trite , commonplace nature of bamboo facades that you can see all over the place , there is a touching rustic charm to the Grass Academy .  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
When dengue fever was attacking southern Taiwan , the average health center in a rural township had only five employees . But communities there are spread widely and it required a great deal of time and personnel to visit each and every community and inspect outdoor containers of standing water , destroy carrier mosquitoes , and spray disinfectant .  
Indeed , in recent years , with the government promoting the reuse of neglected spaces ( much as it promoted " holistic community building " a few years earlier ) , the seeds of creativity and idealism have been planted in cities , towns and rural hamlets . Idle and abandoned century-old buildings , whether publicly or privately owned , have sprung to life again . Meanwhile , a connection has been discovered between preserving memories of the past and promoting the arts .  
There have long been radio stations-especially those that have a clearly defined regional identity and announcers with that down-home accent-which , after broadcasting a few popular songs , start in on sales pitches in fluent , authentic Taiwanese . These shows are especially attractive to elderly listeners in rural areas .  
In the nearly 60 years since the end of World War II , societies around the world have undergone breathtaking transformations . The tide of industrialization has carried hundreds of millions of rural youth away from the land to work in urban factories , bringing about the disintegration of the traditional multi-generational extended family . Without the cohesion and support of the clan , it is a tall order for these young people to build and maintain stable , happy , mutually reliant families .  
According to many environmental groups , experience with kitchen waste recycling in rural communities shows that during the initial stages , residents were unclear about what was to be recycled , and as a result kitchen wastes were provided without first draining them , or items such as stray toilet paper , chopsticks , and plastic bags were often found mixed in . This type of front-end problem with the collection system is relatively easy to correct using instruction and appropriate adjustments . The real headache turns out to be with the downstream processes .  
Meanwhile the assistant secretary-general of the Chinese Youth Development Fund ( CYDF ) , Xu Yongguang , also paid a visit to Nan in Hong Kong . The CYDF is most famous for " Project Hope , " which gave poor rural children a shot at education , and once Xu heard Nan 's ideas on classical education , he put into action a successor project for classical studies based around ancient poetry and classical texts .  
Fifty thousand people came to the just-completed Science Exhibition Center during the three days of the exhibition . Adults and children alike personally experienced all kinds of dynamic and static activities , including small-scale interactive simulations , inventions , camps for creative exchanges between urban and rural students , and forums on the process of creative practice .  
Chen Huai-en of the Department of Visual Communication Design at National Yunlin University of Science thinks that our aesthetic sensibility is still influenced by our rural past , and we have a scant aesthetic conception of foreign societies . He says that despite our hideous surroundings , a fair number of Taiwanese have developed a critical consciousness and are looking forward to an aesthetic society .  
The reporter learned from Guilin 's Flood and Drought Prevention Headquarter that over the past few days Guilin and its surrounding 12 counties ( autonomous counties ) saw heavy rain .  In Yongfu County , the water level was 4.45 meters above the warning line , cutting all roads linking the county town to rural townships .  
A major factor in the rural-urban shift in population is the real or perceived disparities between urban and rural areas in economic opportunities and in social and cultural amenities .  
In remote , rural areas , the programme was usually limited to the basic essential information , such as the meaning of the " red " and the " blue " ballots , and practice voting .  
A transition from the present energy supply of mainly firewood and animal and human power to a more diversified base and a better use of commercial energy was key to improving the living conditions of rural populations .  
Governments were requested to rationalize urban growth and improve the quality of life in rural areas through the promotion of integrated rural development programmes with economic , social and environmental dimensions .  
Fuller consideration must also be given to tapping the surplus rural female workforce within economic development , paying special attention to developing township enterprises that are suitable for women , while ensuring good and safe working conditions .  
In most developing countries , the direct impact is virtually inconsequential in light of the large numbers of poor who , often rural and either unemployed or underemployed , have little if any prospect to work for a foreign affiliate .  
The objective is to achieve adequate shelter for rapidly growing populations and for the currently deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling and environmentally sustainable approach to shelter development and improvement .  
These include defining the role of the African State and its institutions with the aim of sustaining political reform ; enhancing national cohesion ; improving the quality of economic governance ; and facilitating balanced rural and urban development .  
Indeed , sound management of rural and urban settlements can be the vehicle for overcoming many of the social , economic and environmental problems faced by all countries , industrialized and developing .  
An initial investment in social organization at the local level is followed by financial support to implement certain key communal projects which respond to priority needs identified by rural communities themselves .  
Measures should be taken to ensure wide dispersal of educational facilities across geographical space , at least up to the secondary school level , so that access of all women living in remote and rural areas is fostered .  
The Sudanese Government had prepared a comprehensive plan to combat poverty by raising rural living standards through economic and social development plans , with similar projects directed at poor urban dwellers .  
Factional fighting which broke out in Kabul , Afghanistan , on 1 January 1994 , continued throughout the year , causing renewed displacement and imposing a heavy burden on rural communities recovering from 15 years of war .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , Recalling chapters 7 and 28 of Agenda 21 , dd / adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the main objective of which is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor ,  
The Assistant Secretary-General then stated that rural human settlements issues should not be neglected , as the overall situation of the urban and rural poor had become worse , with 40 per cent more people living in absolute poverty compared to 15 years ago .  
While on the subject of youth issues , we should refer to the importance of devoting special attention to the neediest categories of society , especially the handicapped and those who live in rural areas in which only basic services are available to the young , as well as the inhabitants of areas with particular difficulties , such as those under occupation and those afflicted by armed conflicts .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Given the very low levels of per capita energy consumption in rural households in the developing countries at present , the absolute rise in residential energy consumption needs to be very rapid simply to satisfy basic human needs .  
The potential contribution of improved efficiency in meeting growing needs for energy services in a sustainable way in the rural areas of developing countries can be substantial , especially at the point of end use , by introducing new , efficient , low-polluting technologies and systems and by upgrading existing , inefficient systems .  
Economic development and increasing per capita incomes in rural areas may be expected to be accompanied by substantial increases in the consumption of fossil fuels not only in modernized agriculture and transportation but also in households , especially if prices in real terms remain as low as in recent years .  
In order to avoid even more serious and even catastrophic consequences for the rural environment and productivity , substantial increases in the use of fossil fuels for rural energy services will be unavoidable if modern renewable energy technologies can not make a major contribution to the rural energy mix .  
Another constraint is the lack of sustained political commitment to , and support of , the process of enhanced productivity , economic growth and social equity in rural areas .  This is often caused by a lack of long-term national energy strategies with the objective of balanced national economic and social development .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Deeply concerned about the lack of economic independence of rural women owing to their lack of access to land ownership , productive resources , and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and owing as well to inadequate professional and technical skills as a result of the restricted access of women to education , training and literacy programmes ,  
Expressing deep concern about the marginalization of rural women , especially young women with small children , women living in extreme poverty in rural areas and the sexual harassment experienced by , and the violence perpetrated against , them , including those in war-affected areas , as well as about the effect of male migrant workers ,  
Appeals to Governments to empower rural women , to be aware of and develop their potential and to actively engage , individually or in groups , in the fight for the enforcement of their rights , the improvement of their civil , personal and professional status , and the increasing of their representation in sufficient number in all policy-making , decision-making and consultative bodies and functions ;  
Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of a social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
" Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
To create a focus in national development plans and budgets on investment in human capital , with special policies and programmes directed at rural areas , the urban poor , women and children .  
The overall human settlement objective is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor .  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
Establish procedures to incorporate children 's concerns into all relevant policies and strategies for environment and development at the local , regional and national levels , including those concerning allocation of and entitlement to natural resources , housing and recreation needs , and control of pollution and toxicity in both rural and urban areas .  
National and local educational authorities and relevant United Nations agencies should expand , as appropriate , the use of audio-visual methods , especially in rural areas in mobile units , by producing television and radio programmes for developing countries , involving local participation , employing interactive multimedia methods and integrating advanced methods with folk media ;  
The Gambia noted that the high rate of rural-urban migration was a great concern for the Government ; the outflow had contributed towards aggravating congestion , worsening sanitary conditions , increasing unemployment and its effects on youth , and putting excessive pressure on social infrastructure in urban areas , as well as producing labour shortages in the rural areas .  
A main conclusion of this study is that eastern Kenya 's limited resource base and rapid rate of population growth require comprehensive rural and regional development planning .  
The representative replied that the mechanisms were focal points for rural development , education and popular participation , a few committees dealing with specific issues , various other connections at the societal and international levels and that the National Secretariat was represented in seven out of the nine provinces of the country .  
Members asked for concrete examples of temporary special measures , and whether any such measures were foreseen to correct the high illiteracy rate , the low employment rate of women and the low rate of participation of women in political decision-making or to protect indigenous and rural women .  
She indicated that the choice of method was directly linked to location ( urban or rural ) and to the level of education , with women living in urban areas and with a high level of education tending to choose modern methods . 
In reply to a question about concrete steps the Government had taken to raise the living standards of indigenous women , the representative said that the Government had primarily directed its efforts to supporting the basic needs of rural women .  
In her answer to the question concerning measures taken by her Government to ensure that the level of women 's representation in public life did not decline , particularly in rural areas , the representative said that legislation in the Russian Federation contained no discriminatory rules limiting the participation of women in the political life of the country .  
In that connection , the Office had submitted to the legislature a preliminary bill on domestic workers designed to protect young women from rural areas who were engaged as domestic servants and who , as a result of deep-rooted cultural discrimination , were denied the minimum social benefits provided under the General Labour Act .  
Promote changes in attitudes , structures , policies , laws and practices in order to eliminate all obstacles to human dignity , equality and equity in the family and society ; and promote full and equal participation of urban and rural women , and women with disabilities , in social , economic and political life , including in the formulation , implementation and follow-up of public policies and programmes ;  
Economic opportunities for rural women should be improved through elimination of legal , social , cultural and practical obstacles to women 's participation in economic activities and ensuring that women have equal access to productive resources .  
Access to credit by small rural or urban producers , landless farmers and other people with low or no income should be substantially improved , with special attention to the needs of women , and disadvantaged and vulnerable groups by :  
This migration is mainly a shift from rural to urban areas within developing countries , but also as continued high levels of migration flow between countries , and increasing interregional migration - particularly from developing countries with poor , fast growing populations , to developed countries .  
They typically possess limited institutional and human resource capacity to assess the implications for sustainable agricultural and rural development of ongoing developmental plans .  
In all countries , policies oriented towards promoting food and agricultural production and rural development and raising or maintaining farm incomes , while protecting the natural resource base , need to be coherent , consistent and mutually supportive ;  
Another programme that previously focused on small-scale , on-farm efforts in the use and conservation of water and soil resources and on traditional dryland crops has recently expanded to also cover off-farm common property resources and the development of viable alternative livelihood systems in marginal rural areas .  
ECA provides advisory services and support to its member States on agriculture and rural development policies , planning and programming , with a focus on measures for the conservation of natural forests and their biodiversity , desertification and the related conservation of biodiversity , the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and green belts in targeted countries , and the strengthening of regional cooperation programmes for the optimum and sustainable use of inland and marine fisheries .  
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
Increased public and private investment in agricultural infrastructure , including irrigation and drainage , rural energy , transport and markets will be required ; in this connection , a long-term plan should be developed to reclaim the 10-million square kilometres in Africa lost to tsetse fly infestation .  
The large and growing number of children who , due to rural exodus , extreme poverty , abandonment , as well as situations of violence within the family , are forced to live and / or work in the streets , are deprived of their fundamental rights and exposed to various forms of exploitation , is a matter of deep concern .  
Increase budgetary allocations for basic health and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the health of girls and women and to rural health programmes ; ( b ) Develop innovative approaches to funding health services through promoting community participation and local financing .  
In the developing countries , conceptual and methodological constraints and conventional labour force definitions and statistical systems still do not adequately reflect women 's productive work in the non-market economy , as producers in subsistence agriculture and in the urban and rural informal sector .  
By contrast , many traditional manufacturing industries , particularly those located in rural areas which are more numerous , more labour intensive and employ a larger proportion of women , especially during slack periods in the agricultural cycle , have stagnated under the pressure of increased competition . 
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
This has been a critical step forward in the context of translating project-induced increases in agricultural productivity and often a strengthened resource base into adequate diets for rural poor households .  
In the rural areas , where they are predominantly located in most of the developing regions except Latin America , they are the landless or near-landless illiterate agricultural workers , nomads , fishermen , pastoralists and forest dwellers who eke out a subsistence income from seasonal agricultural employment or from marginal lands and forests or from low-income non-farm work .  
Many countries allocate considerable proportions of public expenditures for food subsidies , but the bulk of those allocations go to civil servants , the police , families of the armed forces , and factory employees - in sum , largely to urban areas where they benefit middle - income groups , while the rural and urban poor benefit only marginally .  
For the rural poor who constitute the bulk of the poor in developing countries and who are unskilled and illiterate , the most effective approach to providing them with productive assets is agrarian reform - redistribution of land and reform of tenancy laws . 
It is generally recognized that the capacity of agriculture to absorb the growing labour force on a long-term basis is limited in most of the developing countries with a high incidence of rural poverty by the sheer unavailability of additional arable land . 
The budgetary burden will increase in the short and medium terms in connection with the extension of economic and social infrastructures to the rural areas and the unserviced urban periphery and inner-city slums where the poor are living .  
The objective is to assist the large numbers of the homeless and those living in poor shelter and unhealthy neighbourhoods , whether in urban slums and squatter areas or in poor rural areas , to meet their housing needs .  
The reports identify five major causes of increasing urbanization , all of which are about the search for better living conditions : rural unemployment and underemployment ; poor rural social services ; lack of arable land ; natural disasters , particularly drought ; and civil unrest .  
In a document UNCHS prepared for the Conference , on population , urbanization and quality of life , it underlined the positive effects of urbanization on social change and modernization , on fertility , mortality and other demographic trends , on personal and household income levels and on the general economic development of both the rural and urban areas .  
Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
All parties involved in the development process , including academic institutions , non-governmental organizations and grass-roots and women 's groups , should mobilize to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes directed towards the poorest and most disadvantaged groups of women , such as rural and indigenous women , female heads of households , young women and older women , refugees and migrant women and women with disabilities .  
Enhance the access of disadvantaged women , including women entrepreneurs , in rural , remote and urban areas to financial services through strengthening links between the formal banks and intermediary lending organizations , including legislative support , training for women and institutional strengthening for intermediary institutions with a view to mobilizing capital for those institutions and increasing the availability of credit ;  
Deeply concerned by the lack of economic independence of rural women owing to their lack of access to land ownership , productive resources , and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and owing as well to inadequate professional and technical skills as a result of the restricted access of women to training and literacy programmes ,  
Strongly appeals to all women , in particular rural women , to be aware of and develop their potential and actively engage , individually or in groups , in the fight for the enforcement of their rights , the improvement of their civil , personal and professional status , and the increasing of their representation in sufficient number in all policy-making , decision-making and consultative bodies and functions ;  
Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of any social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
During its special session ( 6-17 February 1995 ) on energy for rural development , the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development noted that adequate energy inputs were required for increased standards of living and productivity of human labour and for income generation in rural areas in developing countries where , on the eve of the twenty-first century , 2.5-billion people still have little or no access to commercial energy supplies and electricity .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
Structure services to reach rural and urban women involved in small , micro and medium-scale enterprises , with special attention to young , low-income , ethnic and racial minority , and indigenous women who lack access to capital and assets ;  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy and numeric problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Work under this subprogramme will be aimed at advancing consultations on the effects of adjustment policies , external openness and improved linkages with international markets on agricultural industries ; analysing the impact of increased participation by the agricultural sector in international markets on the public and private sectors ; and analysing recent experience in the agricultural land market , with special reference to the effects on promotion of small rural holdings .  
Such measures vary in range : pricing policies for agricultural inputs required by small farmers in raising their production ; policies regarding access to small credit facilities ; special measures required to make education accessible to children born in remote rural areas who participate in seasonal agricultural activities alongside adults ; elimination of legislative and bureaucratic barriers to the informal sector .  
The activities under this subprogramme will aim at strengthening the capability of ESCAP members and associate members in environmental and natural resource management ; integration of environmental considerations into economic policy decision-making ; transfer of environmentally sound technologies ; sustainable rural and urban development ; population and sustainable development ; and natural disaster reduction .  
Although they said that the main focus of UNICEF should continue to be in rural areas , several delegations stressed the need for UNICEF to emphasize poor populations living in such environmentally vulnerable areas as slums and marginal urban pockets .  
A regional project in southern Africa is providing training to managers and field workers in interpersonal communication skills and the use of low-cost audiovisual materials .  Rural radio remains the most effective mass medium to reach large numbers of rural audiences and FAO is continuing its efforts to strengthen rural radio services , especially in Africa .  
The ASEAN Population Programme covers training for population control , development of population information networks and studies on relevant issues ; the women 's programme addresses common problems such as illiteracy , lack of technical skills , poor nutrition and ill health , and strenuous workload especially among rural women .  SADC has established a culture and information sector whose main objective is to ensure the people 's involvement in the process of regional integration and development .  
Through its normative and field programmes at the global , regional , national and local levels in assessment and monitoring of land resources , policy and planning assistance , development and transfer of technologies , capacity building and demonstration in agriculture , livestock , forestry , fisheries and rural development .  FAO continues to contribute actively to desertification control , drought preparedness and mitigation and integrated dry land development in affected countries .  
This increase took place particularly in places close to the scene of intensified fighting and reflected the growing inability of both rural and urban populations to cope with the daily problems caused by the fighting , the collapse of social services and the unstable economic situation .  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
Lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health .  
Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Promote women 's economic independence , including employment , and eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of poverty through changes in economic structures , ensuring equal access for all women , including those in rural areas , as vital development agents , to productive resources , opportunities and public services ;  
NULLCooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the League of Arab States continued during 1994-1995 in technical fields of mutual interest in the areas of agriculture and rural development , natural resources and environment protection , human resources training and global economic and social development .  
An apparent alienation of the formal financial system from indigenous economic actors , especially in the rural areas , and in the urban informal sector and small-scale enterprises .  
The complex social and political circumstances of the rural human settlements indicates that the transfer of their productive , social and habitational infrastructure will remain an issue of particular delicacy , with a potential for aggravated social tension within the regions where they are situated .  
The event could also include an exposition of traditional and improved farmers ' instruments , artisanal products of rural communities from various parts of the developing world , a photo exhibit , stands for publications , a video show and a musical programme , while the African and international media would cover the event through national and satellite television networks .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The tangible benefits of this work were : increased quality production of salt ; enhanced income generation for rural women ; training and better information through the provision of simple technology ; and the use of solar evaporation methods leading to less deforestation and saving of foreign exchange when salt did not need to be imported .  
As a result of the sanctions , it has become increasingly difficult to satisfy minimum existential needs , especially in the case of the unemployed , the employed with low income and family income below a social minimum , pensioners with low pensions and family incomes , families with children , elderly rural households , etc .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The United Nations system 's operational activities for rehabilitation during the past year have focused on assisting local communities in rural infrastructure , food production , health improvement , animal health services , rehabilitation of disabled people and human settlements .  The main underlying purpose of these activities is poverty alleviation and human development .  
It noted that rural economic production was increasing from a very low base and that self-sufficiency in food production is achievable provided additional inputs to existing programmes are made available .  
40 Given the typical characteristics of rural areas , such as sparseness of population , lack of trained personnel , low initial demand and high costs of installing individual services , it was suggested that the introduction of enhanced information exchange in rural areas of Africa should be achieved through the establishment of telecentres where services would be pooled to serve the entire community .  
The objectives of the social , economic and technical strategies addressing the conditions of women in poor rural and marginal urban areas were to provide an immediate remedy for their survival needs , help them find economic options that improve their conditions , and propose strategies to achieve sustainable food security , safe energy sources , clean water , sanitation , and secure income to alleviate extreme poverty .  
In India , programmes to guarantee employment to the rural poor and unemployed youth , meet the nutritional , educational and health needs of women and promote their empowerment , and mass literacy programmes were central to the realization of situation-specific strategies .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ; 
contacts made a crucial contribution to the formulation of the highly relevant group projects listed below aimed at underpinning the educational system and supporting rural community economic development , including the delivery of primary health care and other services , and facilitating internships of UNETPSA and other graduates within the civil service . 
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
In its substantive programme actions , FAO continued to develop innovative interventions oriented towards increasing rural women 's access to and control of productive resources , especially through improved extension and training .  
Social services have an essential role to play in preventing the abandonment of rural areas and in seeing to it that services are available where people live and during the accelerated development of large urban areas ; they must ensure the functioning of infrastructure , such as roads and hospitals , built at high cost but threatened with collapse by a lack of will and of personnel able to maintain and manage them .  
The renewed decentralization at the level of urban and rural communes a total of 208 in the entire national territory formed the framework for basic development .  
The new Mission was able adequately to ensure the presence of the international community and the direct support of the United Nations for the peace process , especially in the areas that proved to be most critical to the implementation of the Chapultepec Agreement : public security , constitutional and legislative reform , the land-transfer programme and the transfer of rural human settlements .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .  
In the past four years the economy recorded an average growth rate of 8.2 per cent , resulting in increased employment opportunities and significantly rising living standards in the country , primarily in urban areas , where private enterprises are flourishing , and in fertile rural areas , where farmers have better incentive to grow and market their produce .  
With a population of fewer than 400,000 people of diverse ethnic and linguistic origins , 80 per cent of whom live in rural settings on hundreds of islands arrayed over 1,600 kilometres of ocean , no other system is workable .  
The desire to ensure effective democratization in national life and to foster development is at the core of the activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to benefit children , young people , women , indigenous and rural populations , the disabled and certain particularly disadvantaged urban groups .  
It is focusing on strengthening the institutional capacities of government , at both the central and local levels , with regard to policy management and poverty monitoring ; promoting human resources development by providing better access to health and education opportunities ; alleviating rural poverty ; and developing and strengthening the basic social-safety net , among other issues .  
Rural development and prosperity-decentralization in the region have been expedited by building up economic and social basic services to catalyse sustainable rural development and by expanding the quality and quantity of basic services to meet the local demands of the country .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) has focused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating progress in agricultural development , food security , human resources development , rural and urban development , the establishment and maintenance of infrastructures , the creation of the appropriate social environment , and the enhancement of regional economic cooperation .  
Further , it had established a family planning and education policy which allowed it , through mother and child public health services , to keep the population informed regarding every kind of health and nutritional problem , and it applied strict primary and community health care policies in villages and rural centres .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women , and ensure that they specifically address the special needs of girls and women , as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents ; the rural and urban poor ; persons in remote or neglected areas ; and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
A much-needed increase in productivity of rural areas of developing countries , in terms of agricultural output and processing , would require supplies of efficient , modern fuels for mechanized agriculture , rural transport and operating of essential tools and machineries . 
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .

Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;  
It was currently preparing an integrated plan of action to combat the so-called " paramilitary " groups that had sown death and terror in rural areas , and planned to reactivate a special armed group capable of tackling those groups successfully .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to provide Nicaragua , at the request of its Government , with all possible assistance to support the consolidation of peace , democracy and sustainable development in such areas as caring for displaced persons , land ownership and land tenure in rural areas , appropriate care for war-disabled persons , mine clearance and the overcoming of difficulties in the restoration of the productive areas of the country , and , in general , a process of sustained economic and social recovery and development so that the peace and democracy already achieved become irreversible ;  
The current supply of energy to rural areas of developing countries where the bulk of the population live is inadequate ; there is therefore an urgent need to expand substantially the supply of energy , including rural electrification , to stimulate economic growth or at least help arrest , reverse and eventually eradicate poverty , which is rampant in these areas .  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
Our present objective is to achieve adequate shelter for all and especially for the deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter that is environmentally sound .  
Such efforts can contribute to improving the linkage of rural settlements with the mainstream of economic , social and cultural life , to assuring sustainable communities and safe environments , and to reducing pressures on urban growth .  
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
Promote the active participation of all stakeholders , including those in isolated and remote communities , in ensuring the integrated consideration of the environmental , social and economic objectives of rural development efforts ;  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
The living and working conditions in all human settlements , including regional urban centres , rural service centres , rural hamlets , rural communities , market towns and villages , must be improved , with particular emphasis on shelter , social and physical infrastructure , and services .  
Consistent with local needs and conditions , such efforts should include improving human settlements management , encouraging the sustainable development of intermediate cities that create employment opportunities for unemployed rural labour , and providing environmental infrastructure .  
Provide equal access to basic education , while paying special attention to the poor and to youth living in rural areas , and addressing constraints created by distance , lack of educational facilities and social or economic barriers ;  
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Dispose , within both rural and urban areas by the year 2025 , of all sewage , waste waters and solid wastes in a manner in conformity with national or international environmental quality guidelines ;  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
Threats and intimidation continued to be directed against individuals and entities working for the protection of human rights by CVDC members and former military commissioners in rural areas and by unidentified groups operating in urban areas .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
Bearing in mind that the increasing number of women living in poverty in developing countries , especially in the rural areas and urban slums , requires the urgent action of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures at the national and regional levels towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , [ 2 ] / adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women ,  
Commends the efforts of the Institute to address all levels of poverty that hamper so dramatically the advancement of women , through the coordination of research and training activities in the areas of economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; communications ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , sanitation and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different population groups , such as the girl child , older women , displaced women , refugee and migrant women and women in rural areas ;  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed the willingness of his Government to take immediate , active steps to promote crop substitution and rural development , in close cooperation with UNDCP and other States , by purchasing products such as wheat , cotton and rice from Afghan farmers at prices higher than they could obtain from illicit crops , by contributing to road construction , and by assisting in preventive education and public awareness campaigns for Afghan farmers .  
In order to support the eastern and southern regions with planned rural development projects , the Department for Priority Regions for Development was established within the State Planning Organization , and based upon certain socio-economic criteria the 28 least developed provinces were identified and included in a specific programme within the planned development projects .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Conduct thematic studies to evaluate poverty alleviation strategies , especially with reference to women workers in the informal sector - on such themes as poverty , household food security and gender , focusing on the feminization of poverty as expressed in food insecurity ; conduct studies with respect to adapting successful credit systems in different socio-cultural areas , with particular emphasis on the needs of poor rural women , and to integrating information on credit systems into non-formal education ; undertake case-studies on the role of female entrepreneurs in the least developed countries ;  
From a water allocation perspective , water in aquifers and rivers has to be shared on three complementary levels : ( a ) local sharing between water-dependent sectors and users ( households , industries , irrigated agriculture ) ; ( b ) urban / rural sharing ; and ( c ) upstream / downstream sharing by sequential reuse .  
The evolution of an integrated land / water-oriented action plan to achieve a balanced development of the river system , taking into account all relevant factors ( demographic changes , ecological , socio-economic , hydrologic and hydraulic factors , and spatial and agronomic potentials of the basin ) and ensuring proper attention to urban / rural and upstream / downstream competition for water ;  
To strengthen the capacity of Governments at the national and local levels as well as of the private sector to manage the rapidly growing demand for infrastructure and services in urban and rural settlements in an economically efficient and environmentally and socially sustainable manner ;  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
If followed through to a logical conclusion , a multisectoral , system-wide programming approach could facilitate work with the vulnerable rural youth audience by dealing with all aspects of the drug problem through a number of simultaneous activities including programmes in formal and non-formal education and competency-based training , demand reduction , construction of health facilities and addressing related health issues , law enforcement and crime prevention issues , alternative crop production and other drug-related issues in any given country .  NULLOrganizational approach to developing a multiple agency ,  
The driving forces behind increasingly serious water problems include rapid world population growth - in terms of both rapid urbanization and rural populations growing beyond local carrying capacity - and rising expectations and dependence on reliable water-related services to meet social needs , economic activity and food production .  
Technical advisory services were provided by the Group on a variety of development issues , covering such areas as : inland water transport ; subregional cooperation for lake basin development ; implementation of the African Platform for Action on Women ; formulation of development priorities , programmes and projects ; economic cooperation and integration ; human resources development and utilization , and energy development ; criminal justice and crime prevention ; mineral resources and development ; agricultural development ; rural development ; industrial development ; and science and technology development . 
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
However new problems have been appearing in rural areas with respect to restitution of private land ownership , transformation of agricultural cooperatives and reduced opportunities to find a city job by women coming from the province in the form of requirements for requalification and / or new professions available to provincial women , e.g . , new forms of gainful employment executable at home .  
This policy statement , intended as a contribution by the world 's farmers to the World Food Summit , emphasized that in order to increase food production while at the same time assuring sustainable relationships with the natural environment and maintaining stable rural societies , farmers acting through their own organizations needed to take a central role . 
Only by means of a people-centred , participatory approach will effective transformation of the rural sector occur ; cooperative enterprise is one of the most efficient organizational vehicles for such transformation in developing regions - as it has been in the past when similar conditions existed in the rural economies of currently developed countries .  
Promoting ways to expand and intensify activities in the identification of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , especially in the regions not yet involved in ongoing initiatives , including special ways and means to assist developing countries in which forests and woodlands are essential in meeting basic subsistence needs of rural populations and forest-dwelling peoples ;  
In some rural areas , when police officers refused to deploy to outlying districts , citing lack of facilities and logistical problems , judicial and other local authorities frequently improvised by relying on locally elected officials ( CASEC ) or unofficial communal police , who sometimes worked in collaboration with HNP to carry out police duties .  
The activities of FAO in support of the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe and CIS concentrate on support for the implementation of economic and institutional reforms undertaken since the early 1990s as they involve and affect the agricultural and rural sector and , through assistance in approaching sustainable development , on support for the integration of the agriculture of these countries into the world economy .  
A major study on the role and status of rural women in the central and eastern European countries is instrumental in designing a plan of action to assist rural women in the transition and constituted a part of the preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 .  
Difficulties developed and delays again occurred in a number of areas , including the institutional consolidation of the public security sector ; the adoption of legal and constitutional reforms ; the reform of the judicial and electoral systems ; the transfer of land to former combatants ; and the transfer of rural human settlements to their current occupants .  
We reiterate that a comprehensive strategy in the fight against drugs must include the social and economic aspects of the phenomenon , to which end efforts must be directed towards alternative social and regional development programmes designed to help improve the living conditions of the rural families affected .  
On 11 April 1995 , the qualifications board of the Ignacio Agramonte lower secondary school dismissed \ x { 8072 } gel D \ x { 5adb } alo Machado from his post as a physics teacher for not participating in the activities of the escuela al campo ( a period of mandatory service by students in rural areas ) or in political activities , and for not paying dues to the official union .  
The conception of these national and regional work-sites has evolved and they now cover very diversified activities ranging from water and soil conservation , reforestation , sinking of shallow wells , and protection of archaeological sites in rural areas to the repair of public buildings , sanitation and hygiene campaigns , and beautification and development of towns .  
The programme is intended for poor people living in rural , urban and peri-urban areas and has the advantage of combining various components designed to mitigate the chief manifestations of poverty : underemployment and unemployment , lack of skills , and precarious living and environmental conditions . 
Following the visits of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to a number of the country 's rural and urban areas , during which he noted the inhabitants ' difficult living conditions , the Select Ministerial Council decided to establish a national programme to remedy the situation in districts lacking basic infrastructures . 
The Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) assisted the postal administrations of the countries concerned , mainly in modernizing their organizational structures and in improving the quality of their service to the urban and rural communities they serve .  
In addition , given the natural cycles of drought and floods in the region , weaknesses of rural and urban infrastructure , shortage of food stocks and seeds , generalized poverty , and vulnerability of the majority of the economic agents , the country will inevitably continue to face future emergency situations , at the local level or nationwide , arising from natural calamities .  
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill-treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as the girl child , children of single-parent families and those born out of wedlock , children in rural areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who , in order to survive , are living and / or working in the streets .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee recommends that special protective measures be implemented in relation to children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single-parent families , children born out of wedlock , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , children involved with the juvenile justice system , particularly when deprived of their liberty , children involved in child labour and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee also recommends that further measures be taken to gather systematic quantitative and qualitative data , disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , colour , rural / urban and social origin , on all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children , particularly the most disadvantaged groups .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements worldwide , 2 .  Endorses the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements [ 3 ] / and the Habitat Agenda [ 4 ] / adopted by the Conference on 14 June 1996 ;  
Thus , the informal sector is not a transitory activity , as assumed in the 1970s , where the urban unemployed and rural migrants obtain temporary employment before moving on to the modern sector , but has become a permanent feature and an important means of survival for a large proportion of the urban population .  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
Relevant disaggregated information ( for example , by gender , age , region , rural / urban areas and social and ethnic origin ) should be given on children having benefited from any of these measures and resources allocated to them ( at the national , regional and local levels , and where appropriate at the federal and provincial levels ) .  
To ensure appropriate prenatal and post _ natal health care for mothers , indicating the nature of services provided , including appropriate information given , the coverage ensured , the rate of mortality and its main causes ( average and disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , region , urban / rural area , social and ethnic origin ) , the proportion of pregnant women who have access to and benefit from pre _ and post _ natal health care , trained personnel and hospital care and delivery ;

To make educational and vocational information and guidance available and accessible to all children , indicating , inter alia , the forms of such information and guidance , the mechanisms used to assess their effectiveness , the budget allocated for that purpose , as well as any relevant disaggregated data , including by age , gender , region , urban / rural area , and social and ethnic origin ;  
Relevant information should also be provided on the progress achieved in the implementation of article 40 , any difficulties encountered and targets set for the future , as well as disaggregated data on the children concerned , inter alia by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , national , social and ethnic origin , offence and disposition made available .  
Reports should also identify , inter alia , the mechanisms established and the programmes and activities developed for that purpose , as well as the education and vocational training provided , and indicate relevant disaggregated data on the children concerned , including by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , and social and ethnic origin .  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
The transfer of the productive and social infrastructure of rural human settlements , as well as their housing , to their current occupants remains a complicated undertaking that requires continued efforts from all involved parties , including the affected communities . 
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements , 
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
IFAD was already supporting countries in the early stages of implementing the Convention through the formulation of investment projects at the local level , including projects that attempted to provide an enabling environment in which farmers could help themselves , including the development of rural financial systems , demand-driven technology development , and decentralized institutions for community action .  
" Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,

The programmes contained in the appeal are aimed at establishing nationwide mechanisms that respond to immediate needs , such as basic relief , mine clearance and repatriation , and other mechanisms that respond to priority needs in deprived areas in the different regions , such as the provision of safe drinking water , primary health care , urban and rural recovery .  
Notwithstanding the modest level of funding that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) has received for activities in this sector , the total collapse of the rural infrastructure , the destruction of irrigation systems and the presence of mines in prime agricultural land , WFP has had remarkable success in assisting in the relaunching of food production .  
Today , the infrastructure in remote and rural areas can be significantly improved through satellite remote sensing , particularly with respect to natural disaster warning and mitigation , management of water , forest and food resources , planning and operation of transport systems and other supporting activities relating to social and economic development .  
" Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
" Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements worldwide ,

Environmentally induced migrations are caused by natural disasters , such as earthquakes , flash flooding , typhoons , and volcanic eruptions ; by nuclear and hazardous waste contamination ; by agricultural and rural decline , resource pollution , chronic water shortages ; or by dam construction and other large-scale development projects .  
Human settlements should therefore be at the centre of concern for sustainable development , as they are essential for social and economic progress and , in an increasingly interdependent world , critical for the well-being of both urban and rural populations ( see box 1 ) .  
According to a recent UNDP publication , 5 there are , today , good opportunities in remote rural areas of developing countries for using renewable sources of energy at competitive costs to meet the small-scale mechanical or electric power needs of the individual household , farm or village .

Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
UNDP is providing support to emerging governance and administrative structures at the highest possible level ( community , district , or regional ) for economic and social rehabilitation and reintegration in both rural and urban settings .  
The law provided a framework for improving their status , but it was unevenly implemented because of ingrained cultural attitudes ; large segments of rural and urban society still resorted to customary laws in regard to marriage and divorce and dangerous traditional practices , such as circumcision , continued to prevail in many areas .  
The fact that the level of cultural and communal services in rural areas has deteriorated and the absence of comfortable settings for work and living are increasingly causing internal migration of the rural population to urban areas .  
Within the framework of the WHO project , implemented in three stages , national specialists have been undergoing training , both abroad and in-country ; laboratories for analyses have been set up in provinces and towns ; and the necessary equipment , instruments , chemical substances and diagnostic devices for analysis have been supplied to urban and rural areas .  
The survey was conducted at the national level using a sample of 10,000 households ( 6,000 urban and 4,000 rural ) , arranged in a random selection in three stages , with probability proportional to size .  
Furthermore , the network of the Centre for Initiatives and Advancement for Women , as part of a project receiving financial support from the European Union , is promoting an improvement in the status of women by increasing their active participation in the countrys development and thus affording equal opportunities for women to contribute effectively to national economic , social , cultural and political processes , placing special emphasis on rural areas .  
Discussions of land management at the eighth session might focus on the integrated management and planning of agricultural and non-agricultural land , including forests , watersheds , protected eco-systems and settlements , so as to meet the growing needs of rural and urban populations for food , water and forest products , while protecting essential ecosystems and ecological services .  
Despite the fact that the majority of the worlds poor still live in rural areas , the rapid urbanization of the developing world has raised awareness of the problems associated with urban poverty , including increasing levels of slum housing , unprotected and informal employment , street children and child labour , crime , drug abuse and homelessness .  
Three studies on population and development , on migration and urbanization and on adolescent reproductive health ; a manual for creating population directory databases ; a country profile on plant nutrient sector development ( annual ) ; strengthening income-generating opportunities for rural women in selected Central Asian republics ; rural employment promotion ; and overview of housing rights in Asia and the Pacific ; ( iii ) Electronic , audio and video issuances .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Instead of uprooting the family from its permanent place of residence , many would-be migrants find it preferable to maintain dual , sometimes triple , residences , and conventional dichotomies of rural / urban , agriculture / industry , proletariat / peasantry are becoming blurred .  
In the Asia and the Pacific region , while continuing its important partnership with the Governments of each country , UNDP formed strategic partnerships with civil society organizations , NGOs , women 's groups , trade organizations , the private sector , advocates for the environment and against child labour , politicians , parliamentarians , and poor urban and rural slum communities themselves .  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,

The Committee is concerned about the disparities of living standards , especially with regard to education , health , life expectancy , child mortality , access to piped water and electricity and employment , to be found between the prosperous north _ east coast of Tunisia and the underdeveloped north _ west , between the interior of the country and the south , and between the towns and rural areas .  
For example , in Thailand , women working on family-owned land under contract to multinational companies earned cash income for the first time after years of unpaid labour in intensive rice cultivation . 15 However , the vertical integration of the agricultural sector which comes with the involvement of multinational corporations makes rural household food security vulnerable to market fluctuations . 
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damages sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
The seafaring industries , which frequently draw on the poorest strata of the population in developing countries for employment , have shown that employment in the shipping industry has a major impact on both rural and urban poor ( access to foreign currency , regular salary , economic viability for the families of seafarers and for the local community ) .  
To pursue participatory and sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries , forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas , which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household , national , regional and global levels , and combat pests , drought and desertification , considering the multifunctional character of agriculture ;  
To promote optimal allocation and use of public and private investments to foster human resources , sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries and forestry systems , and rural development , in high and low potential areas ;  
In its concluding observations regarding Guatemala ( E / C . 12 / 1 / Add . 3 of 28 May 1996 ) the Committee expressed serious concern at the adverse effects of the economic and social disparities on the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the majority of the population , particularly by the indigenous and rural populations of Guatemala .  
The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
After the Cairo Conference , the National Department of Health , in collaboration with other Government agencies , the private sector , civil society and donors , prepared our fourth National Health Plan , which encourages a fundamental shift in the way health services are delivered to Papua New Guineans living in urban and rural areas .  
We also reaffirm that , as set forth at the Fourth World Conference on Women , we are determined to promote women 's economic independence , including employment , and to eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of poverty through changes in economic structures , ensuring equal access for all women , including those in rural areas , as vital development agents , to productive resources , opportunities and public services .  
They should be comprehensive in their approach , while allowing for the flexible use of policy instruments in accordance with specific national and sectoral conditions , including those in the rural sector , and should be pursued , as appropriate , at national and international level with a particular focus on :  
The main premise guiding INSTRAWs research area is that womens involvement in urban and rural , national and local politics , as well as their untiring efforts to advance womens causes through the mobilization of civil society , contributes not only to gender equality but also to expanding the boundaries of citizenship , democratization , civil society and political decision-making .  
Developing countries need to be encouraged to utilize space in support of their national developmental activities and to address the basic requirements of their people : education , pollution monitoring , health , telecommunications , environmental management , weather and climate applications , utilization of natural resources , food security , urban and rural infrastructure , land-use management and many other local-level resource problems ;  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party and further recommends that it increase measures to reduce economic and social disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
Of particular concern are certain vulnerable groups of children , including children with disabilities , particularly mental disabilities , girls , particularly Vidomegons , children living in remote rural areas , children living in extreme poverty , children living and / or working on the street , refugee and asylum _ seeking children , children in the juvenile justice system , children born out of wedlock , children of incestuous relations , and institutionalized children .  
Concern is expressed at the lack of a systematic , comprehensive and disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data _ collection mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention , especially the most sensitive , such as child abuse or ill _ treatment , but also in relation to all vulnerable groups of children , especially girls , children with disabilities , children living in rural areas , children living in poverty and refugee children .  
With regard to the implementation of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 36 , para . 15 ) about the persistent regional disparities between the Atlantic and Central / Pacific regions , the growing disparities between urban and rural areas as well as the increasing number of people living in urban poor and marginalized areas .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party to reduce economic , social and regional disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
This role may be characterized in very broad terms as ( a ) meeting the rapidly growing demand for energy services in the industrial , transport , commercial , agricultural and household sectors ; ( b ) servicing developing countries rural energy requirements with modern energy carriers ; and ( c ) dealing with environmental problems at various levels .  
Following the World Solar Summit , held at Harare in September 1996 , organized under the guidance of the World Solar Commission , a 10-year programme aimed at the wider use of all sources of environmentally sound , renewable energies , as well as at improving the quality of life , notably in the rural areas of developing countries , was prepared and subsequently approved by the World Solar Commission in June 1997 .  
Such activities are intended to promote energy efficiency and demand-side management ; clean energy technologies ; more widespread development and application of renewable energy technologies ; improved access to modern energy services by rural populations ; capacity-building and institutional development ; energy sector planning and management to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of sustainable development ; and the promotion of environmentally sound energy technologies .  
Meetings : two are planned for 2000 , with the leadership or close collaboration of the United Nations programme on ageing an expert examination of the interaction of social technologies and multigenerational ties ( supported by the Government of the United Kingdom and being organized by HelpAge International ) ; and an international conference on rural ageing ( being organized by the University of West Virginia ) .  
Furthermore , the relations between ILO and the concerned OIC institutions were strengthened through the exchange of information on issues of mutual interest , including the promotion of employment , enhancement of the performance of the national economies in the region , poverty alleviation , social security , empowerment of women in rural areas , combating child labour , enhancement of vocational training , vocational rehabilitation and enhancement of occupational safety and health .  
Through renewed support for IDDA , efforts must be intensified to reduce the gap between those with knowledge and skills and those without , as well as to facilitate foreign and domestic private sector investment in the value chain of primary products and other manufacturing activities in order to address the emerging problems of the technology gap , urban unemployment and rural poverty .  
Across the region , there are indications of a growing gap in human development between zones of relative affluence in the capitals and principal cities and the extreme poverty of marginalized rural and urban areas .  There are related patterns of social inequality and exclusion between social groups , reflected in regional data on distribution of income and access to employment , health and education .  
He notes that low levels of disbursement , especially at the local level , continue to erode the already modest share of the national budget allocated to the health sector , and draws attention to the fact that the gap between the budget allocated and actual expenditure is highest for the operating expenses of rural health services , crucial for the well-being of the population .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damage sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
Commodities continue to provide an important economic starting base : they have a high value-added component ; agricultural commodities are an important source of employment and offer scope for anti-poverty campaigns ; and agriculture frequently acts as a buffer against economic problems and allows the return to rural areas of urban unemployed , as in the current crisis .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Statistics showed that female-headed households constituted 47 per cent of the rural and 29 per cent of the urban population living below the poverty line , and that women represented a disproportionate share of the agricultural labour force , but controlled only 38 per cent of its operations . 
The objectives were to achieve nutritional coverage of the most vulnerable sector , reduce maternal and infant mortality , and ensure the supply of clean drinking water ; eliminate female illiteracy in rural areas and provide vocational training in urban areas , and educate women about their rights ; and reduce poverty , provide small loans to womens rural cooperatives , and increase employment .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
At the same time , the continuation of the public auction of radio frequencies is still giving rise to discontent and frustration in indigenous organizations , which have no resources with which to buy them and are therefore being deprived of a fundamental medium of expression , particularly in rural areas .  
The National Programme for Educational Self-Management ( PRONADE ) , with local support and participation , provided for over 175,000 children in 1998 , mainly in rural areas , thereby narrowing the traditional gap between urban and rural educational coverage and improving the quality of education .  
It had enacted a law on the sustainable use of Fijis limited renewable and non-renewable land and sea resources and readjusted its sectoral policies with a view to ensuring sustained natural resource utilization ; the development of human-resource-based industries ; the improvement of social services in the fields of health , education and housing ; poverty alleviation ; rural and urban development ; and disaster management .  
It was working throughout the developing world to fight land degradation and poverty ; in Asia , it had initiated a programme targeting very poor rural households in upland areas , which integrated natural resource management , economic diversification and the creation of local employment . 
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Recognizing the need for continuing international assistance for the maintenance abroad and the voluntary repatriation and resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons , and welcoming the voluntary return of refugees to rural districts in Afghanistan that are relatively stable and secure ,  
A key question for UNCTAD to consider is : can the barriers to international trade in agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough to enable a poverty reduction strategy for the rural developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm employment rather than on a heavy reliance on social programmes and social safety net ?  
Their joint negative impact on agricultural growth rates in the developing world is a major reason for the slow progress in rural development , and for rural poverty reduction over the last half century .  
Can the barriers to international trade for agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough for a poverty reduction strategy for rural areas of the developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm activities rather than on social programmes and safety nets ?  
The primary components of the draft sustainable energy and climate change strategy include : promoting strategic innovations in the delivery of sustainable energy services in rural areas of developing countries ; increasing the use of market-based policies to achieve climate change objectives ; and encouraging the participation of developing countries in climate change negotiations by promoting their capacity to identify , negotiate and implement key issues .  
In sub-Saharan Africa , half the population has no access to health care , 42 per cent of the adult population is illiterate , one third have a life expectancy of only 40 years and about 2-million deaths registered in 1998 were caused by AIDS ; 59 per cent of the rural population and 43 per cent of the urban population live in abject poverty , with an annual income of about $ 100 .  
We are providing social care for the elderly , orphans , the disabled and poor families , as well as special care for the people of rural areas , including economic and social necessities aimed at limiting urban migration .  
We are creating opportunities to advance by improving the educational level of the population , continuing educational reform , expanding coverage and enhancing quality at all levels , particularly in rural and suburban areas .  
Encourages non-governmental organizations , private funding institutions and individual donors to organize and support assistance programmes and missions tailored to the needs of areas where psychological psychiatric problems are prevalent among the population , in particular among poor urban and rural women , with a view to providing not only primary treatment but also training for family members and or other persons who may take over the care of the afflicted persons ;  
For rural areas not connected to grids , sustained programmes of investment in decentralized rural energy schemes , based on an efficient use of renewable energy sources , where reasonable , should be launched , with the incremental cost of such schemes to be met , where necessary from regional and global sources , to meet local demands for energy services .  
Of the estimated 3.1-billion people in rural areas , approximately 2-billion have no access to electricity and about the same number of people rely on traditional energy sources for cooking , such as wood , charcoal and animal and plant wastes , which are associated with adverse environmental effects at the local level .  
Policies for rural development and rural energy policies should be developed and implemented in a mutually reinforcing way and appropriate government agencies within the responsible ministry for national energy policy should be assigned specific duty for rural energy , in some cases at the local or provincial levels .  
The positive engagement with the natural resource base is essential not only to maintain local and national food security but also to offer opportunities for balanced rural development .  
Mr . Nebenzia ( Russian Federation ) said that his country attached great importance to international cooperation for the sustainable development of human settlements and the improvement of the social and economic conditions of urban and rural populations.In that context , the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements played a vital role as guarantor of the implementation of the decisions taken at the Habitat II Conference .  
However , the efforts to spread basic education in rural areas are hampered by a number of constraints of a geographical , economic and cultural nature ( absence of means of communication , scattered habitations , mountainous areas in certain regions , etc . ) .  
In implementation of high royal instructions placing rural areas at the heart of governmental strategy , in the framework of the policy enabling all citizens to participate in cultural life and to contribute to the improvement of rural living conditions , and with a view to improving the geographical distribution of cultural services and facilities , the Ministry of Culture has initiated , in cooperation with local communities , an extensive programme to build and equip libraries in rural centres .  
In the framework of the decentralization and democratisation of cultural life , having regard to the role of culture in all economic and social development , and in order to enable rural areas to enjoy appropriate cultural facilities in accordance with law 47-96 on regional organization , permanent committees responsible for educational and cultural matters have been established as part of the sixteen recently created regional councils .  
It was reasonable to expect that , in the foreseeable future , most of the pertinent telecommunication activities and services in developing countries would develop and revolve around those thrust areas , which had been identified as follows : ( a ) distance education ; ( b ) mobile personal communications ; ( c ) direct-to-home television and radio broadcasting ; ( d ) telemedicine ; ( e ) rural telecommunications ; and ( f ) Internet services .  
For small loads typical of rural households in remote areas with sufficient insolation , solar PV systems are proving to be economically and technically successful , when complemented by an institutional approach , including financial arrangements , that provides for the installation of the systems and maintenance on a fee-for-service basis .  
It includes purchase of one digital satellite ( hot standby ) terminal , one Optaphone digitally controlled rural telephone link system , four global positioning systems and the replacement of 30 base mobile transceivers .  
Thus , since 1995 , INDAP has explicitly mainstreamed a gender perspective in its regular institutional activities , meaning that a cross-cutting approach will be taken to each of its activities and measures , based on the recognition of rural families as a basic unit of the production process , with different requirements according to their composition and specific members ( men , women , young people , older persons , relatives , etc . ) .  
In 1995 , a Rural Division was created within the National Office for Womens Affairs to ensure that the Ministry of Agriculture and its affiliated offices , decentralized agencies and other public and private entities associated with rural womens issues incorporate measures and actions guaranteeing equal opportunity for rural women into their planning and regular activities .  
In fiscal 1998 the Bank allocated to the social sector US $ 8 , 480-million out of total lending of US $ 28 , 594-million , including US $ 1.9-billion for health , population and nutrition ; US $ 665 million for basic infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation facilities ; and US $ 3.1-billion for education , placing greater emphasis on primary education for girls , the rural poor and linguistic minorities .  
Among the main concerns in the region are unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of those natural resources on which rural communities depend ; optimized use of land ; living conditions of coastal people ; insufficiently treated urban wastes , oil pollution and coastal erosion .  
The official United Nations demographic estimates and projections will be prepared for all countries and areas of the world , as well as urban and rural areas and major cities , and will serve as the standard and consistent set of population figures for use throughout the United Nations system . 
The review , with an explicit gender perspective , of existing legislative and administrative frameworks in the context of urban policy reforms , will be required to support the partnership process towards the provision of land , shelter , infrastructure and services at the level of poor urban and rural settlements .  
the expressed satisfaction of policy makers and authorities with the quality of services and advice rendered in connection with rural development , agricultural policies , industrial competitiveness , entrepreneurial development and energy integration and management , as well as with the contribution to enhanced coordination and collaboration with regional organizations and bodies . 19.129 During the biennium 20002001 , the following outputs will be delivered : 
Bangladesh commended the Secretary-General for highlighting the plight of women in rural areas , women migrant workers and girls affected by traditional and customary practices , and agreed that the effects of globalization and liberalization , along with declining international cooperation , had resulted in the increased marginalization of rural women throughout the developing world .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,

Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
The disease affects everyone poor , rich ; urban , rural ; employee , employer , unemployed ; educated , ignorant ; married , single ; young , old ; resident , tourist .  
Obstacles : Benefits of the growing global economy have been unevenly distributed , creating wider economic disparities , unsafe working environments and persistent gender inequality in the informal economy and rural sector .  
Since those elected bodies were instruments of local cell governments , responsible for plans for economic development and social justice , rural women could now play a leading role in shaping the destiny of their community .  
Strategic options being considered include fostering human capital development and the creation of permanent rural jobs through public investments geared to conserving and restoring natural resources ;  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that nongovernmental and communitybased organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grassroots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Governments need to develop a suitable legal and institutional environment to facilitate active partnerships with the private sector in a manner that ensures the provision of services to the urban and rural poor .

The representative informed the Committee that women in her country faced sociocultural and economic discrimination , particularly in the rural areas where 84.6 per cent of the population lived and where deeplyrooted traditions and customs shaped daily life . 
Striving to meet basic needs but unable to increase their productivity , poor rural households in most lowincome countries have been forced to expand onto marginal lands and / or mine their existing land base through unsustainable landmanagement practices .  
The objective is to achieve adequate shelter and access to basic services for all , especially the deprived urban and rural poor , through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter and services .  
Enabling policies and programmes at the national and local level are to be implemented that assist the efforts of the private and nongovernmental sectors , and the selfhelp efforts of poor residents in urban and rural areas , to improve shelter conditions .  
The minimum standard of living is established on the basis of baskets of indispensable things such as food , clothing , lodging and items of hygiene , calculated according to the population segments in urban and rural areas .  
The position of women is traditionally weak and subordinate in Nepalese society , rendering the CPN programmes , with their strong emphasis on equality , attractive , both among the growing cadre of educated women and those of the disadvantaged in rural areas .  
But over and above traditional legal aid , which is generally limited to criminal matters , the expert emphasized the need to help rural people to use common law as an instrument to improve their rights situation .  
FAO designed a regional project on increasing rural womens food productivity through improved agricultural technology transfer and adoption in Africa , involving relevant United Nations agencies and selected countries in the region .

In mid1999 , fewer than 30 per cent of urban dwellers had a regular service , there were no operational systems in rural areas and the quality of water posed a threat to public health .  
Urges United Nations organizations , the international community and non-governmental organizations to continue their efforts aimed at the enhanced ownership and participation of the eastern Timorese , known as Timorization , in East Timor , in the social , economic and administrative infrastructure and , in this regard , stresses the need for capacity-building , inter alia , in such areas as education , health , agriculture and rural development , the judiciary , governance and public administration , security and law and order ; .  
The Beijing Platform for Action notes that lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health ( para . 
[ 16 ] Alongside the absence of a commitment to making primary education free , and uncertainties as to which children will be classified as poor ( or ultra-poor ) to merit bursaries , this model also raises concerns about the administrative costs of collecting school fees ( necessarily minuscule in poor rural Zambia ) and administrating the bursaries ( also minuscule ) . 
Female genital mutilation had been banned in many African countries ; policy-makers and healthcare providers in many countries were paying more attention to adolescent reproductive health ; access to health services was being improved for poor rural women and efforts were being made to address the particular vulnerability of women and girl children to the HIV / AIDS epidemic .  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of non-discrimination is not fully implemented for non-citizen children , children belonging to minorities , including Roma children , poor or dysfunctional families , children with disabilities and children living in rural areas , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
In light of its previous concluding observations and taking note of efforts by the State party to combat poverty and its negative effects on children , the Committee remains concerned at the large disparities in the enjoyment of economic and social rights , particularly health and education , by children living in rural areas and regions lagging behind in socio-economic development .  
The Committee is also concerned that the State party has not taken measures to address discrimination against children who are born out of wedlock , those affected by HIV / AIDS , children in remote rural areas , children born of incestuous relationships , institutionalized children , pregnant girls , children with disabilities , street children and children of ethnic minority groups .  
The Committee notes with concern the poor health situation of children in the State party and in particular the limited access to basic health care for children ( especially in rural and mountainous areas ) , high maternal , child and infant mortality rates , low and decreasing immunization levels , high rates of malnutrition , poor sanitation and limited access to safe drinking water , especially in rural communities .  
The Committee welcomes the State partys efforts in the field of education , in particular the inclusion of human rights teaching , including childrens rights , in the school curricula , but it remains concerned about the high drop-out and repetition rates in primary and secondary schools , disparities between urban and rural areas in terms of access to education and to quality education , the insufficient number of well-trained teaching staff and childrens limited access to materials and text books .  
Reaffirming that alternative development as a process to prevent and eliminate the illicit cultivation of plants containing narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances by adopting rural development measures that are specifically designed for that purpose and that are carried out in the context of sustained national economic growth and sustainable development efforts in countries taking action against drugs , recognizing the particular socio-cultural characteristics of the target communities and groups , within the framework of a comprehensive and permanent solution to the problem of illicit drugs ,  
Within that global objective , the Commission would concentrate on six areas of comparative advantage : trade and development ; regional integration and cooperation ; macro-economic policies linked with poverty reduction strategies , in particular the strengthening of social sectors such as health and education ; reliable and sustainable transport ; food security and sustainable rural development strategies ; and institutional capacity-building , good governance and the rule of law .  
Although a few women have achieved high social status in modern political , economic or professional life , the situation of the average woman , especially in rural areas , remains dire .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
The programme of work under this section has been elaborated within the framework of programme 15 of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 ( A / 55 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , which identifies three major themes : ( a ) promoting regional economic cooperation ; ( b ) alleviating poverty in rural and urban areas ; and ( c ) protecting the environment , improving the management of natural resources and focusing on the development of infrastructure and information systems .  
Mindful of the fact that the Asian and Pacific region has two thirds of the worlds population living under the absolute poverty level and the imperative of integrating environmental considerations into economic and social development , the programme will highlight a stronger poverty alleviation thrust , particularly in the areas of social development , population and rural and urban development , and environmental and natural resources management .  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
The suffering of large numbers of children especially infants and nursing mothers from lack of primary health care , basic health services and malnutrition or unbalanced diets , lack of clean drinking water and proper sanitation , especially in rural and desert areas , poor districts and refugee camps , increased hazards of environmental pollution , dangers of the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and lack of care provided to children with special needs ;  
The Commission also encouraged Governments to take into consideration the health and safety concerns of women and children in rural energy programmes , and to promote efforts to address the disproportionate burdens experienced by women in rural areas in access to energy supply .  Governments were encouraged to improve policies that reduce environmental health hazards , including through plans and strategies to prevent , mitigate and respond to diseases resulting from indoor and outdoor air pollution , giving special attention to the health of women and children .  
However , persistent political tension along Guineas southern borders and the resultant prolonged presence of refugees , especially in the rural areas , have been putting tremendous pressure on its natural resources .  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
This implies an increased focus on issues like good governance at national and international levels and the fight against corruption , respect for all internationally recognized human rights , gender issues , capacity and institutional building , social services supply and environmental concerns .  The majority of the poor live in rural areas .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
While we strive our best to mobilize domestic resources and to learn from best practices , the global community must help us with increased flows of official development assistance , better trading opportunities , expanded debt relief and support for institutional development so that our people , living in urban and rural areas alike , can lead a decent and productive life .  
Accessibility to reliable and affordable energy was very unevenly distributed , both between countries and within countries , and many developing countries faced an urgent need to provide adequate , reliable and affordable energy services to millions of people in rural areas .  
Convinced that human rights education and information is in the best interests of particularly vulnerable segments of society , such as children , youth , women , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with HIV / AIDs and disabled persons ,  
They urged that Israel should be required to pay reparations for the material losses resulting from its aggression against the occupied Palestinian territories , such as the destruction of urban and rural installations , as well as for the many Palestinian lives that have been lost , the serious wounds that have been inflicted and the permanent disabilities that have been caused , as has been the case in the past when compensation has been paid to victims of aggression in similar cases . 
The fourth edition of the World Banks Poverty Trends and Voices of the Poor , 2001 reports on recent progress in poverty reduction for selected countries on the basis of data derived primarily from surveys using national poverty lines , not the $ 1 a day poverty line . 1 In East Asia , the sharp decline in poverty in China during the 1990s was accompanied by widening income inequality between the countrys more rural western provinces and the more industrialized east , which probably slowed the overall rate of poverty reduction for the country . 
In its resolution 54 / 135 of 17 December 1999 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General , in cooperation with the relevant international organizations , specialized agencies , funds and programmes , and in consultation with Member States , to prepare a comprehensive report on the situation of rural women and challenges faced by them , based , inter alia , on the outcome of an expert group meeting , which would draw from the contributions and case studies provided by experts from various regions and to submit it to the Assembly at its fifty-sixth session .  
In the process of rural industrialization , independent entrepreneurs cater for local and international markets and act as subcontractors to larger domestic and foreign firms , thus further intensifying market integration .  
A renewed commercial interest in biodiversity and indigenous plants and materials has created opportunities for rural women to utilize their traditional knowledge and experience and to take advantage of emerging national and global markets .  
With increased demand for cheap female labour and aggressive job advertising on the part of prospective employers , rural women who are relatively isolated from the outside world can be faced with the risks of trafficking and HIV / AIDS .  
In addition , it is important to create an enabling policy environment for improving the situation of rural women , which would include the design and implementation of a gender-sensitive macroeconomic policy framework and social support systems which would accommodate womens productive and reproductive roles and encourage a more equal gender division of labour in the household . 
Training programmes and discussions aimed at both rural women and men to promote gender awareness should be organized by national and local governments , human rights groups and other non-governmental organizations in order to encourage the sharing of parental roles and domestic duties by men .  
Governments , donors , non-governmental organizations and the private sector should develop specific assistance programmes and advisory services for the development of the economic skills of rural women in banking , modern trading and financial procedures , matching the requirements of the market economy .  
The indigenous knowledge of rural women and their experience in subsistence production and environmental management should be recognized by national and local governments and development experts as a resource , and should be integrated into formal programmes .  
Those factors included : continued high dependence on food imports ; a direct linkage between rural agricultural viability and poverty reduction ; difficulties in balancing the short-term benefits of food aid and its long-term impact ; severe adjustment costs arising from unilateral liberalization of the agricultural sector ; non-competitiveness of agricultural exports in the world market ; and high dependence of foreign exchange earnings on exports of one or two agricultural commodity under preferential market access .  
He also agreed with the call for the establishment of concrete provisions relating to special and differential treatment and to provide developing countries with technical assistance to allow them to meet their legitimate needs , such as rural development and food security .  
Such projects have included peoples sensitization campaigns on indigenous people issues in Chile ; training sessions for school teachers and representatives of social groups in Chile ; the establishment of a centre in Mexico where human rights violations can be reported and which provides legal assistance to vulnerable groups , such as rural populations , street children , prisoners and people living with HIV / AIDS . France Liberts has also been advocating against the death penalty ; a CD-ROM against racism was also produced and distributed among schools and for public awareness purposes . 
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
The studies point out that development of a coherent rural , national and international transport network is essential for stimulating economic activity , opening up productive areas in individual countries and linking them to national , regional and international markets .  
Noting that FAO viewed the HIV / AIDS pandemic not just as a health issue but as a problem of critical importance for development in general , she said that her organization was prompted by increasing evidence that HIV / AIDS intensified existing labour bottlenecks in agriculture , worsened the problem of malnutrition and further complicated the problems of rural women . 
Invites Member States , in collaboration with the United Nations organizations and civil society , to place a renewed focus on the issue of improving the situation of rural women in implementing at both national and international levels the Beijing Declaration2 and Platform for Action3 and the outcome document6 adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-third special session , taking into account also the conclusions and recommendations of the United Nations expert group meeting on the situation of rural women within the context of globalization , held in 2001 , by , inter alia :  
The issue of sustainable development should be addressed , since increased burning of firewood by the rural population , which lacks access to modern commercial energy , leads to environmental problems .  
The overall goal of the country programme is the realization of the rights of all children and women in rural and urban communities through the reduction of infant and under-five mortality rates ; the reduction of the maternal mortality ratio ; the reduction of severe and moderate malnutrition ; universal access to safe drinking water ; increased access to sanitation ; universal access to primary education ; and the elimination of child labour .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to seek views of Member States on the desirability of convening a high-level policy consultation at the governmental level with a view to setting priorities and developing critical strategies that would meet the manifold challenges faced by rural women ;  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas , with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being , and in this regard encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;

Underlines with concern that key commitments remain outstanding in the areas of fiscal , judicial , military , electoral and land reform , as well as decentralization and rural development , and therefore urges that those commitments be implemented without further delay ;  
While the Johannesburg agenda was challenging and daunting , it offered a real chance to demonstrate the power of collaboration and to work for the common good , provided that all relevant actors in the United Nations system , Governments , businesses , urban and rural communities , rich and poor countries joined forces to overcome humanitys tremendous challenges and chose the path of sustainable development .  
Develop and utilize indigenous energy sources and infrastructures for various local uses and promote rural community participation , including local Agenda 21 groups , with the support of the international community , in developing and utilizing renewable energy technologies to meet their daily energy needs to find simple and local solutions ;  
Promoting at the regional level rural electrification projects , including renewable energy technologies , and supporting local efforts to provide energy supplies to their basic infrastructures as well as integrating energy policies into overall rural development strategies , with emphasis on income generation , taking into account national circumstances ;  
Increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , including improving access to rural credit facilities , providing improved investment incentives in accordance with their international commitments , as well as supporting institutions involved in research and development and extension services ;  
Investing in and strengthening efforts to meet the basic needs of rural women through capacity-building and human resources development measures and the provision of a safe and reliable water supply , health services , including family planning services , and nutritional programmes as well as education and literacy programmes and social support measures ;  
Contribute to the development of small and medium enterprises and assist Member States in the development and the implementation of effective policies , and in the establishment of a coherent set of specialized support institutions and programmes , paying special attention to rural entrepreneurship development as well as to women entrepreneurs , particularly in the poorest countries ;  
The decentralization that is occurring in many tropical countries can bring benefits to many poor rural people in heavily forested areas , including greater access to forest resources , but weak local technical capacity , limited national support and organizational problems among small-scale loggers undermine prospects for sustainable forest management .  
The basic framework of the study includes : The current population situation and developmental conditions of the Yangtze Delta Region , the regional property development , the developmental trends in property structure and employment population , the developmental trends in urbanization and the development of cities , the total population and the ecological carrying capacity of population resources , the aging of the population , and the social security system of urban and rural areas .  
A government official of Shandong Province told this reporter that this province established agricultural new high level technology development and model zones beginning in 1992 , whose main purpose is to accelerate the transformation of agricultural new high level technology achievements through introducing agricultural new high level technologies from home and abroad to carry out development in order to provide effective models for agricultural production and rural economy development to promote the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture .  
In the face of the strategic readjustment of the agricultural and rural economic structures , we should quickly change the ideas , concepts , leading methods , and the quality of cadres and the masses that are not compatible with the situation in structural readjustment and bring about a tremendous change in the way of thinking and working methods .  
Their ideological and political quality , work style , words and deeds have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies in rural areas , on the reform , development and stability in rural areas , and on the relations between the party and the masses and between the cadres and the masses .  Generally speaking , the great majority of township ( town ) leading cadres are good , diligent , honest in performing official duties and working hard regardless of criticism ;  
If the departments concerned can work in close cooperation , coordinate their actions and produce some tangible results in these activities , it will be conducive to promoting the solution of major and difficult issues that the masses feel very strongly about , thus making the effects of ideological and political work felt deep in the heart of the masses , improving the quality of the population as civilized people , and making the urban and rural areas more civilized .  
In 1999 the average charge per kilowatt of electricity in the rural areas fell by 0.1 yuan , and as a result the peasants paid a total of 23-billion yuan less for their electricity ; many peasants who could not afford electricity in the past have now happily installed color TV and VCD players , and sales of domestic electrical appliances have hotted up in some rural areas .  
Meanwhile , the " Opinions " has also put forward concrete views on how people 's courts can successfully provide a legal guarantee for both the readjustment of the agricultural structure and the development of the rural economy , standardize the financial order according to the law , guard against and avert financial risks , protect intellectual property rights , and provide a guarantee for a sound implementation of the strategy of carrying out a large-scale development in China 's western region .  
He said : Proposals received since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee were broad in content .  They primarily concerned the following : Maintaining a sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy ; strengthening agriculture and doing well in rural work ;  
China 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to the firm leadership of the third-generation leading core .  Zhulin has developed from a hillside village short of water and food into a modern town with all kinds of functions .  Its people , who had worked as farmers for generations , have become town dwellers who created and enjoyed modern civilization .  
In view of this , we feel it a must to integrate the work of returning grain plots with the development of the rural economy , and with the task of extricating peasants from poverty and making them rich ; and a must to find practical and earnest solutions to major problems that are most concerned by the masses , such as sufficient food and firewood as well as increases in their income .  Only in this way can we do a good job in protecting the ecological environment from the basics .  
With the establishment of the market economic system , the change of the macroeconomic situation and , the increase of the total national economic strength , the not high enough quality of the economy in Beijing 's suburbs , its weak ability to adapt to changes , and its insufficient staying power for development are manifesting themselves ever more clearly , and they are becoming the important factors restricting Beijing 's agricultural and rural development .  1 .  
Efforts need to be intensified to reform the system of selecting and promoting grassroots cadres in rural areas and to make correct selection and to select well cadres who meet the basic conditions of possessing good political qualifications , of being able to honestly perform official duties , of having good management capabilities , and of enjoying support from party members and from the masses .  
Training program should be enhanced .  We should help grassroots cadres in rural areas raise their awareness and abilities to lead the masses to readjust the economic structure , and to develop the rural economy , help them raise policy level , enhance legal system concept , change work style , particularly help them raise their levels and capabilities on the correct understanding and handling of the people 's internal contradiction in rural areas in the new period .  
The motions handled since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee , which are rich in content , have mainly included those aimed at maintaining sustained , rapid , and healthy national economic growth ; strengthening agriculture and doing a good job in rural work ; continually and energetically pressing ahead with the state-owned enterprise reform ; guarding against and alleviating the financial crisis ; expanding domestic demand ; continually implementing the principle of opening up to the outside world and vigorously opening up the international market ;  
the vanguard zones of the socialist market economic structure ; and the demonstration zones of sustainable development , which will take the lead in achieving modernization characterized by basically prosperous economy , optimum structure , perfect facilities , beautiful environment , integrated urban and rural areas , sound legal system , and civilized society .  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , the egalitarian system of eating from the same big pot in rural areas has been broken , households have become the main entities for economic operation and investment , and peasants have continuously increased their initiative in participating in the social , political , and economic lives .  
Over more than 20 years of reform and opening up , great development has been made in the rural economy of our country , but the gross economic quantity is still not big enough , and the quality is not high enough .  The current economic conditions still can not satisfy the ever increasing material and cultural needs of the vast number of peasants in their day-to-day lives .  
Since reform and opening up , the living standards of the people in our country have been constantly improving and the actual incomes of urban and rural residents rapidly increasing .  With the remarkable improvement in living conditions , the problem of food and clothing for the people in the whole country has been basically resolved and they are now even marching toward the comparatively well-off level .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
Chen Yaobang said : Through the efforts of several generations , the western region 's agriculture and rural economy will surely develop in a sustained and steady manner and the goal of building the western region into an agricultural producing region with the characteristics of red flowers , green grass and fragrant melons and fruits will surely be realized .  
While inspecting rural areas in Shaanxi recently , Wen Jiabao , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau , member of the Secretariat , and vice premier of the State Council , stressed : This is a crucial year in the new stage of China 's agricultural and rural economic development .  After consecutive years of bumper harvests , the agriculture sector is faced with the heavy tasks of restructuring , raising efficiency , and raising peasants ' income .  Therefore , it is of vital significance to do our job well in agriculture and rural areas .  
Gu Angran said : As reported by judicial organs , a more prominent problem that needs prompt solution at the moment is the question of what kind of work performed by personnel of such rural grass-roots organizations as villagers ' committees in assisting the people 's governments would subject them to the description of " personnel engaged in official business according to law . "  Therefore , the draft interpretation includes a stipulation only on this matter rather than on the full range of " personnel engaged in official business according to law . "  
During the " 10th Five-Year Plan " , the province should remarkably increase the proportion of the non-public sector in its entire economy and should build this sector into a strong motive force to speed up economic growth and employ the jobless in society and into an unexhausted source to increase financial revenues as well as incomes of urban and rural residents .  
A pertinent expert of the Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that some difficulties and problems still existed in the agricultural and rural economic operations at present .  The comparatively conspicuous ones included the relatively great impacts of drought , plant diseases , and insect pests on crops , the continued low prices of most agricultural products , the relatively numerous difficulties confronting the development of township and town enterprises , and so on .  
From a long-term perspective , in order to attain sustained and healthy agricultural and rural economic development , first of all , it is necessary to further push forward the agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment in light of the arrangements made by the central authorities , heighten the quality and economic results of agricultural products , and increase peasants ' income .  
Owing to the slow growth of peasants ' income , the problem of peasants ' burdens is ever more conspicuous .  The work of reducing burdens and increasing income should be done simultaneously , experiments of reforming rural taxes and charges should be properly made , and the work of supervising and managing peasants ' burdens should be performed in real earnest .  The situation of implementing various rules and regulations formulated by the central authorities should be inspected , and all sorts of erroneous practices to increase peasants ' burdens in disguised forms should be resolutely rectified .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
The agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment has a good beginning , quality agricultural products have made rapid development , and the major crop production has been further centralized in the advantageous producing areas .  
have built an omnidirectional stationary civil telecommunications network in light of needs of economic construction and market ; and have built an optical-fiber telecommunications network linking up some rural villages or small towns .  Thus in staging military exercises ;  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
To ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development in Tibet , the party Central Committee has adopted eight major preferential policies for the region , including fiscal , financial , investment , foreign trade , as well as agricultural , animal-husbandry , and rural policies .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .  
In resolving the existing outstanding problems in rural reform and development and achieving a new flying leap in China 's agriculture and rural economy , it is essential to regard development of the rural economy as the main theme , regard deepening the rural reforms and rejuvenating agriculture through science and technology as the motive force , and regard improving the basic living standards of the peasants as the fundamental starting point , and to do a great deal of work in all respects .  
The draft has dedicated an entire chapter to the issue of national defense education for society , and formed stipulations respectively on the formats and demands for developing national defense education by state organs , enterprise units , social groups , committees for city residents , and committees for residents in rural areas ; and the formats and demands of conducting national defense education on militia and people on reserve duty by relevant military organs .  
If we say that since the 1963 National Agro-technology Conference , we have solved the problem of increasing agricultural output , then this session of the National Agro-technology Conference made a strategic adjustment to the direction of the development of agro-technology .  It sets the direction for the development of agricultural technology with optimizing the structure of agriculture , raising agricultural efficiency , improving the rural ecological environment , and strengthening capabilities in the sustainable development of agriculture as the main points for resolving the problem of developing agricultural efficiency .  
Researchers Pan Houren and Zhou Jiahua held that today , when material living standards are improving all the time , it is extremely important to build a rich and excellent cultural life ; the current measures such as small district sports and public welfare facilities which are now being built in a big way , and the rural cultural activities launched by organizing peasants who have become rich are extremely beneficial .  
It firmly takes the steady improvement of the living standards , both material and cultural , of the urban and rural populations as the essential demand of socialism , the fundamental goal of economic development , and the meeting point of the effort to properly handle the relations among reform , development , and stability .  It gives priority to resolving the problems that are of widespread concern to the ordinary people ;  
However , a small number of rural grass-roots cadres have a poor understanding of their mission to wholeheartedly serve the people .  The work style of these cadres is not down-to-earth , their work approach is simple and rude , they do not feel settled in working at the grassroots , and some of them even seek personal profits abusing their powers and encroach on the masses ' interests .  These problems urgently need to be solved .  
The central authorities ' decision to carry out study and educational activities in rural areas throughout the country concerning the important thinking of the " three represents " is an important basic project to step up and improve the party 's leadership over rural work , to deepen rural reform , and boost rural economic and social development , as well as a strategic measure to step up the building of the work style of rural grass-roots cadres .  
The vast numbers of rural grass-roots cadres should practice a good work style and lead the broad masses of peasants to push ahead strategic adjustments of the agricultural and rural economic structures , and help peasants increase their incomes and live a happy life .  
While he was in Hainan , Wei Jianxing went deep to rural areas and peasant households to inspect work , held meetings of discipline inspection and supervision as well as on trade union cadres , and heard reports on the work of the Hainan provincial CPC committee and government .  He fully approved of the Hainan provincial CPC committee and government , in the light of Hainan 's reality .  
While we pay attention to what we have achieved in construction of rural markets , we must also pay attention to the fact that the level of our rural markets is still low and they face such issues as unsound market systems and mechanisms , backward market infrastructures , slow development in the key elements of the market , low degrees of exports , depressed market prices , and low percentages of marketable commodities .  
After liberalized reforms , the systemic reform of the rural economy was a step ahead of that for city economies , but , due to a lack of changes in the agricultural management system by the government , the agricultural product markets and the agricultural key element markets have been split up among various departments such as farming , forestry , economic trade , foreign trade and labor .  In some areas , such administrative departments as animal husbandry , fisheries , and water resources also participate in the market divisions .  
As a result , agriculture was generally regarded as an " inferior " industry .  After liberalized reforms , although agriculture and the rural economies have developed rapidly , the issue of " inferiority " has not been fundamentally solved .  In addition to insufficient inputs into agriculture by the government , agriculture was restricted by both natural and market risks , and agricultural conditions increasingly deteriorated .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .  
and further enhance the quality of rural grassroots cadres and strengthen the cohesion and combat strength of the rural grassroots party organizations , so as to provide strong and effective ideological and organizational guarantee for making a success of agriculture and rural work .  In carrying out this work it is essential to strictly act in accordance with the principles , methods , and measures laid down by the central authorities , and pay particular attention to getting a good grasp of the following issues .  
Hence , the whole process of this study and education drive must be based on arming the rural grassroots cadres with the important thinking on " three represents " ; in particular , it is essential to strengthen their concept of wholeheartedly serving the people , improve their ability to carry out agricultural restructuring and develop rural economy , strengthen their ability to do mass work well in the new situation , and enhance their consciousness of persistently " grasping things with both hands , and firmly with both hands . "  
In developed countries , the proportion of laborers engaged in agricultural production is less than 5 percent , but it is as high as 50 percent in China . In the vast rural areas , the phenomenon of insufficient employment among the peasants is relatively common , so it is a pressing task to readjust agricultural and rural economic structures and do a good job of transferring surplus rural labor forces .  
They have expressed a common appeal at organs , schools , enterprises , rural areas , newspapers , radio and television programs , and internet websites : They resolutely support President Jiang Zemin'srighteous and stern statements delivered at a meeting with foreign guests.They resolutely support the Chinese Government 's proposal to resolve the issuethrough diplomatic channels in accordance with international law andinternational common practice .  They have resolutely urged the US Government toapologize to the Chinese people and to fully shoulder the responsibility .  
To actively provide effective services for readjusting the rural economic structure and increasing peasants ' income , the vast number of rural grassroots cadres should study in depth the conspicuous contradictions in local agriculture and the rural economic structure , get their ideas into shape , draw up and perfect plans for structural readjustment and economic development in the light of local conditions , and go from village to village , household to household to properly determine measures for readjusting the economic structure and increasing income .  
Zeng Qinghong pointed out : In commanding various rural work with the important thinking of " three represents , " we must devote major efforts to advancing the building of socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and the legal system and safeguarding social stability in the countryside to provide an ideological guarantee and good sociopolitical environment for rural economic and social development .  
It is necessary to unremittingly enhance rural grassroots cadres ' ability to lead the masses in readjusting the economic structure and developing the rural economy , try hard to improve their understanding of policy , enhance their legal sense , and try hard to raise their level and ability in correctly understanding and handling the people 's internal contradictions in the new period .  
To promote the sustained and healthy development of compulsory education in rural areas , we must concentrate on doing several jobs well in the future .  First , double the effort to build junior high schools in the countryside to meet a surge in demand for places in junior high schools as the number of children in the relevant age group hits a peak .  
Fourth , increase support for compulsory education in poor areas in central and west China to promote its development .  Fifth , make sure that the wages of rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid on time .  
At Juncheng Township which was the site of the headquarters of the Jin-Cha-Ji [ Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei ] Military District , Wen Jiabao held cordial talks with veteran fighters of the Eighth Route Army who had taken part in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the mass production movement in Yanan . Wen Jiabao inquired about the living conditions of the local people in details and took part in a discussion meeting with local cadres and masses on current rural work .  
When being told that most of the young workers came from rural areas , Hu Jintao praised them : You are hardworking and enthusiastic , have courage to make innovations , not only guaranteed the quality of construction but also lowered the costs of construction and raised the economic efficiency of the enterprises .  You have devoted your energy and sweat to the construction of the capital .  
To properly accomplish the economic rural restructuring in our country , we must clearly understand and master the regularity in the evolution of agricultural and the rural economic structure , and then seize the key points based on such understanding , thus making advances in an orderly way .  
With the scientific and technological progress and the development of modern education , peasants can master better work skills and richer scientific and general knowledge .  This will provide a major driving force for changing the structure of agriculture and the rural economy .  
If some peasants attain a higher level of scientific and technological knowledge and expertise , get access to more information , master more sophisticated work skills , and know how to run machines for processing farm products , then they will be able to break new ground in the countryside to develop the secondary and tertiary industries , and thus promote the adjustment of the rural production structure .  
Since the start of reform and opening up , especially since the third central conference on work in Tibet , various undertakings have surged forward full of vigor , the outlook of urban and rural areas has changed greatly , and people 's living standards have been raised .  All those are unprecedented in the history of Tibet .  
We must persist in focusing our vision on enhancing the overall qualities of the rural grassroots cadres , on resolving current conspicuous problems in the rural areas , and on safeguarding and developing the interests of the peasants ; in particular , we should do a number of practical things centering on rural economic development , to improve rural production and living conditions and make efforts to increase peasant incomes .  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
To meet the requirements of the present new situation in the work of poverty relief through development and in consideration of the current distribution and the special characteristics of the poverty-stricken population in rural areas , the " Program " has placed the stress of state support on minority-inhabited areas , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and exceptionally impoverished areas in the country 's central and western regions .  
Deepening rural reforms , gaining a good grasp on resolving current prominent issues existing in rural grassroots areas , and protecting and putting the basic interests of the peasants into practice is an important part of educational events on the important ideas of " three represents " that have been launched in various areas .  
At present , every locality , on the basis of summing-up and applying successful experiences , is further implementing the demands of " three represents " for the construction of party grassroots organizations , making efforts to heighten the focus and fighting force of the rural grassroots organizations , comprehensively enhancing the overall quality of rural grassroots cadres , and providing solid and forceful ideological and organizational guarantees so that good work can be done on agricultural and rural tasks under the new conditions that confront us .  
We must reform the way elementary education teaching materials are published and distributed to provide rural primary and middle school students with affordable , suitable textbooks , and we must gradually begin to provide free textbooks to children of families having economic difficulties .  
In the " three represents " study and education activities , Shanxi provincial authorities persisted in doing things that the masses think and wish best to be done , improving things that the masses are most dissatisfied with , and making great efforts to resolve the conspicuous problems in the rural areas , thereby forging a close tie between the cadres and masses , and enabling the rural areas in the entire province to take on an entirely new look .  
In quite a few rural areas in Shanxi Province , there still exist the difficulties in traveling , getting drinking water , going to school , seeing a doctor , and so on at present .  In some villages , the leading groups are still in a state of " weakness , slackness , and paralysis " , and in other villages , the clan forces are interfering with village affairs , local ruffians , tyrants , and other evil forces are rampant , and the situation of public order is very grim .  
A number of village party branches and villagers ' committees led the masses in building roads , drawing water , putting up electrical poles , and running schools one after another .  As a result , the healthy atmosphere has grown and evil tendencies have declined in the rural areas , the ugly phenomena such as " pornography , gambling , and drug-taking " and feudal superstition have been considerably reduced , and the " dirty , chaotic , and poor " appearance of the villages has been changed .  
On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
The central leadership recently decided to adopt a management system " with responsibility being borne by local governments , mainly at the county level , and management being conducted from top to bottom at each administrative level under the unified leadership of the State Council " .  Under this system , the responsibilities for each level from central , to provincial , and then prefecture ( city ) and county are all explicitly defined .  In particular , counties must bear the main responsibility for local rural compulsory education .  
The relevant departments of the State Council should formulate unified fee standards and systems for compulsory education in poor and rural areas .  The standards of fees for textbooks and miscellaneous expenses in other areas should be formulated by provincial people 's governments according to local conditions .  
This conference and the State Council 's " Decision " further emphasized the important status and role of elementary education in our country 's modernization drive , set radical measures for promoting the development of compulsory education in rural areas , make arrangements for advancing the conduct of all-round quality-oriented education in primary and middle schools , and drew a blueprint for the reform and development of elementary education in the 10th Five-Year Plan period .  
In order to strengthen guidance for building rural grass-roots party organizations , the central authorities and relevant departments promulgated in succession the " CPC regulations governing the work of rural grass-roots organizations " , the " opinions of the organization department of the CPC Central Committee on strengthening the building of ranks of rural grass-roots cadres " , the " circular on universally implementing in the rural areas the systems of making village affairs public and managing village affairs in a democratic way " , and other important documents .  
From 1994 to 2000 , all localities throughout the country sent more than 3-million organizational cadres group by group to townships and villages to help them carry out rectification work .  Some 356,000 weak , listless , and paralytic village party branches , backward villages , and poverty-stricken village party branches were rectified , accounting for 48.8 percent of the total number of rural party branches ;  
Nearly 20-million rural cadres and grass-roots cadres in China have mastered one practical technology or two , and among them , 3-million people won primary professional technical titles and 500,000 people won secondary professional technical titles . 
The vast numbers of overseas Chinese and the social organizations have a multifaceted connection with China . We can fully put into play the advantages and preferential conditions of language , customs , as well as relations and rural friendships .  On the basis of mutual advantages , we can open cooperative exchanges in multiple channels and broad territories .  
Since reform , the rural economy has undergone substantial adjustment .  However , the public ownership system still holds a dominant position , with farm output quotas being set for each household , and land , which is the primary means of production for agriculture , continuing to be publicly owned .  
The party has persisted in unfolding the main themes , advocating diversified development of our cultural undertakings , and vigorously developing our literature and art , press and publication , and radio and television undertakings to constantly satisfy our people 's increasing spiritual and cultural demands .  Cultural life of our urban and rural people is rich and colorful .  
We created a revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the rural areas and seizing state power by armed force .  With the people 's army as the backbone , we relied on the people and armed them .  We persisted in educating the officers and men in the party 's theory and program and defeated the better-equipped ferocious domestic and foreign enemies in the prolonged revolutionary wars .  
The party 's policy to get the population rich must be adhered to .  On the basis of economic growth , efforts should be made to increase income for urban and rural residents , constantly improve their living conditions , including food , clothing , housing , transport and daily necessities , improve the social security system , and medical and health facilities , with a view to bettering their life .  
Those advanced collectives and outstanding individuals are from enterprises , rural areas , organizations , schools , scientific research institutes , neighborhoods , military and other fronts .  Their advanced deeds and noble spirit have embodied the character , styles and features of contemporary members of the CPC with clear characteristics of our time .  
The fifth is to establish a perfect rural market economic system and insurance system , draw up rules and regulations for the transactions of agricultural products , and promote the setting up of a pluralistic rural capital market in which agricultural policy banks , rural cooperative banks , commercial banks , and other nongovernmental financial organizations exist side by side .  
On the basis of economic development and social progress , it is necessary to increase the income of urban and rural residents , continuously raise the people 's living standards and life quality , and continuously enable the people to gain better and solid economic , political , and cultural benefits .  
The cadre center of the city military sub-district has exploited its advantage of having many politically steadfast veteran cadres and organized and sent its personnel to veteran cadres ' activity centers in urban and rural areas and to neighborhoods to publicize and explain the thinking of " three-represents , " and to encourage veteran cadres to advocate advanced culture .  
The departments concerned of the governments at all levels , especially the agriculture-related departments , should under the unified leadership of Party committees and in the light of the actual conditions in their own departments and own systems effect active coordination to carry out well the educational activities of studying the important thinking of " three represents " in the rural areas .  
The responsible comrades of the Party committees and governments of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , members of the for the joint conference on the educational activities of studying the important thinking of " three represents " in the rural areas , and others respectively attended the teleconference at branch meeting places in localities concerned .  
We , cadres at the basic level in rural areas , should strengthen our self-cultivation , grasp more knowledge of agricultural science and technology , really " represent the progressive course of the advanced culture " in our villages , and strive to do more practical work for the common people .  
Positive steps should be taken to centralize and hand over the power of managing teachers ' wages to the county authorities in conjunction with measures adopted by the departments concerned to carefully verify the authorized number and total payroll of rural primary and secondary school teachers .  " Special wage fund accounts " should be set up in all counties in accordance with regulations to ensure that rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid fully and on time .  The supervision and management of outlays for teachers ' pay should also be strengthened .  
7 .  Collecting electricity fees which exceed electricity price standards , assessing agricultural people unjustified electricity fees , collecting rural network renovation fees which have not been approved by organizations in charge of prices at provincial level , or collecting fees which exceed those formulated by organizations in charge of prices at provincial level , is classified as an illegal pricing action .  
During the period of democratic revolution , given the special conditions of our country at the time , we had no choice but to base our revolution in the rural areas , so the working class and the peasants formed a close alliance .  As a result , the majority of the members of our Party and the revolutionary troops led by the Party were peasants .  
Zhu Rongji 's dialogue with township and town cadres and middle and primary school headmasters told him that the fees collected by middle and primary schools in some rural areas are much higher than the standard ones set by the State Council 's relevant departments for the compulsory education in poor rural areas .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
We want to basically curb the trend toward worsening ecological damages and environmental pollution on land and in the rivers and the oceans .  We want to begin to improve the urban and rural environmental qualities and tentatively set up a comprehensive ecological and environmental monitoring and warning system .  We want to boost our disaster prevention and reduction capabilities and further raise the level of comprehensive resource utilization .  
As for topic on banking , it will include the positioning of policy-related banks , the consolidation of rural credit cooperatives , how to digest bad debts by asset management companies , market-oriented interest rates , foreign exchange control , further resolving contradictions in the current financial operation , and continuing to solve problems which remain unsolved .  
Investment projects in these areas will include building roads and water and power supply systems in the rural areas , building permanent and semi-permanent housings for herdsmen in a way according to the local situations , intensifying comprehensive agricultural development , and developing the Brahmaputra [ the Yaluzangbu Jiang ] and two other rivers , as well as developing animal husbandry in northern Tibet .  
We must do a good job in resolving problems of the current livelihood and long-term production development for peasants where farmland is bring returned to forest , and support the peasants in developing industries for which there are strong local resources and which meet market needs ; through developing small hydroelectric stations , methane , and so on , we should resolve the problems of the peasants ' fuel and rural energy , prevent indiscriminate tree-felling , and protect the results of returning farmland to forest .  
In view of this , we should make a full use of abundant local animal and plant resources , act in line with the requirement of seeking a unity between economic efficiency and ecological efficiency , and gear ourselves to the needs of the market and rely on scientific and technological advances .  We should intensify the structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy ; vigorously develop a highly efficient production of fine-quality medicinal materials , special foodstuffs , and green foodstuffs ;  
Major changes have already taken place , and are currently taking place , in China 's economic system and in its composition of social classes .  In rural areas , along with the deepening of economic restructuring and the progress of agricultural industrialization , peasants have been organically integrated with the market ; and some of peasants have been separated from land and have engaged themselves in the secondary and tertiary industries , among whom some have joined township and town enterprises , some have become self-employed businessmen , while others have become entrepreneurs of private enterprises .  
The great majority of people in these new social classes are playing an important role in promoting the scientific and technological progress of the country , activating our urban and rural markets , optimizing the allocation of resources , creating more jobs , meeting the diversified demands of our people , and boosting the development of the national economy .  
However , restricted by communications and telecommunication conditions , a vast number of farmers and herdsmen living in the remote mountainous areas and rural areas have been unable to accurately learn in a timely fashion the party 's and state 's principles and policies .  
It was learned that while carrying out the " face-to-face " propaganda activity , the propaganda team members mainly explained the party 's and state 's nationality policies , rural policies , and religious policies and publicized the tremendous changes that had taken place in the local areas since reform and opening up .  Each year , they would revise the themes and key topics of the propaganda activity in light of outstanding problems during different periods .  
to look into and put forward proposals regarding rural economic development , key infrastructure construction , protection and building of the ecological environment , restructuring , resource exploitation , and the arrangement of major projects , and to organize and coordinate the enactment and implementation of plans for returning farmland to forest ( grassland ) ;  
Agricultural Minister Chen Yaobang maintained that the time is ripe for China to carry out strategic adjustments for agriculture and the rural economy .  He said the agricultural restructuring will be market-oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .  
However , we should not employ the traditional , planned approach of building a number of new cities and transfer the residents there step by step .  The genuine question lies in how we should form a more appealing and energetic urban economic development dynamic mechanism that will sufficiently attract the surplus labor power in the rural areas to move into cities by way of marketization .  
He said that China 's entry into the WTO will pose a stern challenge to its traditional agriculture .  If no prompt counter measures are taken in rural areas , he continued , the consequence would be grave .  He stressed the need to take it as " the most important of the important tasks " in rural areas today to meet the challenge in connection with China 's entry into the WTO .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
China has a large population and vast territory , but its per capita output value is less than $ 800 , still a rather big gap from the world 's average level .  Hence , there is a considerably large development space , and the elevation of the urban and rural residents ' consumer structure will produce a prolonged and powerful pulling effect on the economic growth .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .  
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .  
Gao Dezhan said : It is necessary to work intensively to formulate laws for protecting peasants ' rights and interests in connection with the ongoing rural taxation and fee-collection reforms ; and according to the laws , stop the irregular practice of some local governments and departments in collecting fees , imposing fines , and raising funds among peasants in various forms and names .  Thus , the peasant 's legitimate rights and interests can be protected by the legal means , and the burdens imposed on them can be reduced .  
However , restricted by communications and telecommunication conditions , a vast number of farmers and herdsmen living in the remote mountainous areas and rural areas have been unable to accurately learn in a timely fashion the party 's and state 's principles and policies .

Thus , the peasant 's legitimate rights and interests can be protected by the legal means , and the burdens imposed on them can be reduced .  
We should make vigorous efforts to strengthen the building of political power at the grass-roots level in rural areas and turn them into strong fighting bastions to prevent and crack down on the criminal activities in abducting and trafficking in women and children .  
With regard to the grain varieties excluded from the scope of purchases at protective prices , grain consuming enterprises and marketing enterprises will be allowed to purchase grain in the rural areas after the examination and approval of the industrial and commercial administrative departments at prefectural ( city ) or county level .  
In his speech , Jiang Chunyun said : As mass organizations that assist the government in mobilizing people to practice family planning , family planning associations at all levels have , over the past 20 years , effectively carried out work around the basic national policy of family planning under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels .  They have played an increasingly prominent role in grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , poverty relief , community development , spiritual civilization , and international exchanges and cooperation .  
The party 's leading organs or grassroots organizations , the party 's organizations in both the enterprises and the rural areas , and our work in economic , scientific , technological , education , ideological , or political fields should embody in an all-round way the requirement of " three represents . "  
We should deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises ; vigorously develop rural and urban collectives , individual ownership , private ownership , and divers types of other economic ownership ; and groom enterprises into the principal bodies in the development of the western region .  
China 's agricultural and rural economic development has now entered a new stage , in which farm products , particularly grain , have turned from a long-standing shortage to a basic balance of supply with demand and even a surplus in years of bumper harvests , and agricultural development has changed from being subject to resource restraints to being subject to the dual restraints of resources and markets .  
With 10 percent of the global arable land , China has managed to meet the basic needs for food and clothing of its population , which is 22 percent of the global population .  The living standard of the urban and rural population is increasing steadily .  
Since the financial crisis in Asia , China 's economy has experienced severe and complicated tests , but it has still maintained a relatively rapid growth .  In particular , since the beginning of this year , an important turning point has emerged : Economic growth has accelerated , economic results have been considerably improved , the growth in foreign trade has been vigorous , urban and rural consumption has been stable and tended to increase , financial revenue has increased by a big margin , and foreign exchange reserve has continued to increase .  
Second , in the past 20 years , a major factor leading to an increase in China 's total-factor productivity is a large-scale allocation of key production factors resulted from structural changes .  What are particularly important are the transfer of rural labor forces and other resources to township and town enterprises and to the secondary and tertiary industries in cities , as well as a rapid development in non-state-owned economies .  
Vice governors , vice chairmen , and vice mayors from pertinent provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments in charge of agricultural and rural work , comrades in charge of pertinent departments including planning , agriculture , water conservancy , civil affairs , and finance , comrades in charge of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps , and comrades in charge of pertinent departments under the central authorities and the State Council attended the conference .  
We should , laying stress on youngsters and " high-risk groups , " go down to universities as well as middle and primary schools ; to public security lockups , reeducation-through-labor centers , detention centers , and rehabilitation centers ; and to residential districts , rural areas , enterprises , and public institutions to properly conduct preventive education on narcotics through various integrated measures to make every family and individual aware of the matter .  
People remember that at the beginning of the founding of New China , the central government immediately took rigorous measures to launch a nationwide anti-narcotics campaign .  It seized narcotics , banned the planting of opium poppies , closed opium halls , sternly punished narcotics producing and trafficking activities , punished over 80,000 narcotics-related criminal elements , forced 20 million drug addicts to quit drug addiction , and eradicated opium poppy planting in conjunction with rural land reform .  
In the rural areas known for a serious problem of narcotics , we must make earnest efforts to include the ban on drug cultivation , drug trafficking , or drug abuse in both " the village rules and the regulations for farmers . "  We must employ effective measures suited to the local conditions , mobilize to the maximum extent the enthusiasm of the farmers and masses in fighting against drug-related crimes , and help implement the requirements for the narcotics control work at the grassroots level in an all-round way .  
According to a recent survey concerning the income of 40,000 urban and rural households by the State Statistics Bureau 's Urban Social and Economic Survey team , in 1999 , urban residents had an average per capita disposable income of 5854 yuan , for an increase of 7.9 percent over the previous year .  After removing the influence of price factors , the actual increase in income was 9.3 percent , a rate of growth higher than that for the gross domestic product .  
And last year , according to projections from a sample survey of rural and urban residents , less than five percent of wealthy people held nearly half of the nation 's private savings ( of a total national savings amount of over 600 billion yuan ) .  
They should put aside their haughty manner , ignore hardship , go deep with great enthusiasm to rural areas having many difficulties and problems where economic development has been slow and local people have lived in poverty .  They should stay at peasants ' home for a few days to experience the masses ' difficulties and hardships , to understand their aspirations and needs , listen to their voices and opinions , and help them find the answers to some practical problems .  They should be faithful representatives of the masses .  
Third , the legal system for urban and rural planning is unsound and the plans drawn up are lacking in authority .  Some leading cadres have a weak legal concept .  They make decisions as they please and do not act according to plan .  
In advancing the course of urbanization , we must , bearing in mind China 's characteristics as a country with a large population , a high percentage of rural inhabitants and a relative shortage of resources , meet the objective requirements of the process of industrialization and modernization while developing the socialist market economy , rationally plan the pattern , scale and speed of urban development as well as the functions , standards and quality of cities and towns , and take the road of urbanization that suits China 's national conditions .  
We must conscientiously sum up the experience and lessons of our work of urban and rural planning , study and learn from the successful methods of other countries , adhere to the objective laws of urban and rural development , base ourselves on the present situation while bearing in mind future needs , take the interests of all parties concerned into account in making comprehensive plans , and promote the coordinated development of the economy , the society and the environment in accordance with the overall requirements of socialist modernization .  
In the formulation of urban and rural development plans , we must take into account the national economic and social development plan as well as the natural environment , resources , historical and present conditions and future development of various localities in drawing a comprehensive layout .  
As a kind of comprehensive planning , urban and rural planning must properly handle the relations between the part and the whole , the near term and the long tem , needs and possibilities , economic development and social development , urban and rural construction and environmental protection , modernization and protection of historical and cultural relics , and so on .  
The party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at the county ( city ) level are standing at the forefront of reform , development , and stability , have a direct link with the vast numbers of workers , peasants , and intellectuals , and directly assume the important tasks of carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies in the grass roots of the urban and rural areas , which has a direct bearing on the image of the party and government among the masses .  
Its national economy is growing at an annual rate of 9.8 percent , the outlook of its urban and rural areas has improved remarkably , its comprehensive urban service functions are being constantly strengthened , the income of its residents has increased by leaps and bounds and its material and cultural life is becoming richer daily .  
The burdens on peasants are heavy , and the growth of their incomes has slowed down ; the problem of enlivening the rural market has yet to be effectively solved , and close attention should be paid to problems caused by natural agricultural disasters and a drop in grain production and in the prices of farm products .  
Members of the CPC Financial and Economic Committee held : Investments by non-state economic sectors have become an important force for pushing our country 's economic growth forward .  In the first half of the year , the growth of investment by urban and rural collectives and by individual persons picked up to some extent , but the speed was still rather slow .  
Second , we can increase the peasants ' nonagricultural income and also effectively increase agricultural labor productivity by reducing the number of laborers directly engaged in agriculture , switching more rural laborers to secondary and tertiary industries , and also guiding the rational movement of rural laborers to meet the objective needs of the towns and the developed areas .  
The bodies affiliated to the Tibet Science and Technology Association have translated and distributed 108 titles of popular science books which they have written for popularizing scientific knowledge and disseminating practical technology on topics such as scientific field cultivation , stockraising , and prevention and control of disease .  They have also shot Tibetan TV documentaries on advanced agricultural technology and sent them to the rural areas .  
and it is also the requirement of speeding up the improvement of ethnic quality and promoting the joint progress of all minorities .  At present the cultural level of the masses in Tibet is not high , a large proportion of adults in the rural and pastoral areas are illiterate , and it is necessary to rely on and use the Tibetan language to popularize scientific and cultural knowledge , improve labor skills , and enrich the people 's cultural life .  
The " Opinions " demands : We should build a vocational education network on the foundation of existing township and town regular and technical schools and rural applied techniques popularization stations .  In economically comparatively backward regions , we should strive to make junior middle-school graduates generally have one or two job skills that can help them become better off .  
The " Opinions " demands that while maintaining an equal level of fund appropriation between vocational schools and regular schools , all localities should gradually increase the appropriation to the former year by year ; that a proper proportion of the subsidies for urban and rural vocational education appropriated by the central government to various provinces and autonomous regions should be used exclusively in the vocational education for minority nationalities and in ethnic minority regions ;  
Social conditions are complex here , the grassroots organizations are weak , the rural propaganda , ideological , and cultural position has not been built effectively , the work style of certain grassroots cadres is rather simple and crude , cadre-masses relations are relatively tense , and rural development and stability have been affected to some extent .  
Facts show that so long as people 's thinking and understanding are enhanced , the " double thinking " education will be warmly supported by the broad cadres and masses and be generally carried out in the vast urban and rural areas .  
However , because of changes in economic conditions and relevant policies , at present , the operating mechanisms , administrative systems , and formats of services of rural credit cooperatives are not conducive for rural economic development .  The risks that have accumulated over the year have gradually become more prominent .  The key indicators included poor-quality assets , operating difficulties , and high potential risks .  
We should persistently promote economic restructuring amid development and maintain a rapid development amid economic restructuring to comprehensively upgrade our industrial structure , raise the standards and economic efficiency of our agriculture , industry and service trade , make a rational readjustment of the distribution of productive forces , promote a coordinated development of local economy and a beneficial interaction between urban and rural economy , and achieve a sustainable development .  
During the Yanan rectification campaign , Comrade Zhang Wentian seriously conducted self-criticism and dissected himself .  In the spirit of " making up missed lessons , " he went deep into reality , to the basic level , and among the masses to carry out investigation and study and enhance understanding in China 's rural economic and social situation .  
Therefore , experts have pointed out that , at this stage , China 's reform of the social security system will be modest and undertaken at several levels , moving at a steady but uneven pace and accepting some differences between the urban and rural areas , among different regions , and among different ownership systems .  
He said that in recent years , Shandong 's urban and rural outlook has changed dramatically , its economic construction has been impressive , and its people 's lives have clearly improved .  The province 's social undertakings have made comprehensive development , and its party construction has been strengthened .  
There are also , however , a number of rural problems that can not be neglected ; the main ones are that it is difficult for the peasants to increase income , and their burdens are too heavy , while the work style of certain grassroots cadres is simple and crude and they issue compulsory orders , causing bad incidents and mass incidents in certain localities .  
and in the rural areas of the reservoir area , the practice of reclaiming farmland by destroying forests has been strictly banned , farmland on the slopes of less than 25 degrees is gradually transformed into level terraces , and vigorous efforts have been devoted to developing a high-efficiency agriculture and an ecologically sound agriculture .  
although grain output has fallen due to serious drought and adjustment of the sown area , output of various agricultural products such as oil-bearing crops , livestock , aquatic products , fruit , and vegetables has continued to increase ; there has been some rebound in the development speed and economic returns of the township and town enterprises ; the building of rural grassroots organizations , democracy and legal system , and spiritual civilization has been further stepped up ;  
Some grassroots cadres have become seriously divorced from reality and the masses in their work ; they are not good at consulting the masses when doing things , are unable to handle rural contradictions in the new period , and display a simple and crude work style by issuing compulsory orders , arousing discontent among the masses .  
Practicing the system of leaving the reasonable burdens on the peasants unchanged for three years is a major policy decision put forward by the central authorities in light of rural realities , and it must be unswervingly implemented .  
in localities where the revamping has not been completed , the maximum charges for rural electric power will be set at the provincial level , and charges that exceed that maximum must be reduced .  
In the meantime , the living standards of the people in central and western regions have significantly improved ; the number of poor areas and impoverished people has continued to decrease ; and the gap between the actual incomes of urban and rural residents in eastern and western regions has somewhat narrowed .  
The session held that continually improving the material and cultural living standards of people in urban and rural areas is the starting and end point of economic development .  
The key to achieving the continuous growth of peasants ' income lies in vigorously adjusting the agricultural structure , positively broadening the spheres for raising peasants ' income , and increasing the intensity of supporting and protecting agriculture to attain rural economic development on all sides . 
While concentrating our energies on achieving agricultural and rural economic development , we must really have a good grasp of the building of rural grassroots organizations , democratic legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization , maintain social stability in the rural areas , and give impetus to the rural economic and social development in a comprehensive way .  
In light of the new rural situation in the new stage , we should carry out education on the party 's basic line and rural policies , the socialist and collective spirit , the transformation of established traditions and practices , the democratic legal system , as well as science and culture .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that the key to developing agricultural and rural economy and pushing forward agricultural modernization lies in the implementation of the strategy to invigorate agriculture on the strength of science and culture and place the training of qualified personnel in a prominent position .  
The development of rural scientific , technological , and educational undertakings and the enhancement of peasants ' ideological and moral level as well as their scientific and cultural standard are the crucial links of implementing the strategy of invigorating agriculture on the strength of science and education and bringing about the change from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture , and also the important contents and guarantee for building the new socialist rural areas , which are the eager aspirations of the vast number of peasants too .  
Since the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , under the guidance of the party 's agricultural and rural policies , tremendous changes have taken place in the appearance of China 's rural areas , the rural economy has developed in a comprehensive way , peasants ' income has been notably increased , and stability has been maintained in rural society .  
A large number of excellent talented people who have made outstanding contributions have emerged in the course of rural economic and social development .  The Ministry of Personnel and the Ministry of Agriculture decided to commend and award 100 fine examples of them , among whom 10 comrades are conferred the title of " National Fine Talent in Rural Areas " and 90 comrades are awarded a first class merit .  
In the wake of rural economic development , especially with the development of the non-agricultural sectors , those sectors that have attained the highest standard of development have begun to integrate into the urban economy at a faster pace .  This marks the beginning of the transition of the dual , urban-versus-rural , economy from a two-tier to a one-tier developmental pattern , indicating that the dual economy is beginning to merge into a unified economy .  
The party and government have always paid great attention to Chinese peasants ' health standards .  They have initiated and extensively launched " bodybuilding activities for hundreds of millions of peasants , " and guided the broad masses of peasants to carry out physical exercise in an effort to attain healthy and strong physiques , upgrade their working and living conditions , and enhance their spiritual civilization construction .  The " PRC Sports Law " has incorporated athletic activities in rural areas under the legal system .  
The circular finally stressed : We should make vigorous efforts to train and utilize qualified personnel capable of working in both military and civilian posts and this is at once a need of army building and a need for tackling the problem of lack of qualified personnel in the rural areas and promoting rural development as well . 
help demobilized servicemen master modern scientific knowledge about agriculture as well as knowledge about a market economy ; heighten overall quality of demobilized servicemen ; and give full scope to demobilized servicemen 's backbone role in building rural power or organizations at the grassroots level in accordance with requirements laid down in " The Plan for Developing the Work of Training and Utilizing Qualified Personnel Capable of Working in Both Military and Civilian Posts . "  
regard the work of bringing about an industrialized agricultural operation as a major measure for speeding up the strategic structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy , and for promoting the modernization of agriculture ; take bold steps in practice and make active explorations ; and strive to enhance the level of the country 's industrialized agricultural operation .  
Leading enterprises are shouldered with the heavy responsibility of bringing along the growth of peasant households , exploring new markets , making scientific and technological innovations , and boosting the development of the regional economy .  The success or failure of leading enterprises has a direct bearing on our work to improve the economic efficiency of agriculture , to increase the income of our peasants , and to maintain the stability of rural areas .  
This will be conducive not only to improving the peasants ' living standards and stabilizing the situation in the rural areas but also to exploiting rural markets and bringing about a sound interaction between industry and agriculture and between the urban and rural economies and a coordinated development of all of them .  
Investment should be focused on the following areas next year : conducting well the ongoing projects funded by national debts ; accelerating the construction and transformation of agricultural and forestry water control projects , transport and communications , urban infrastructure , environmental protection , and urban and rural power grids and the construction of grain reserve depots directly under the central authorities and affordable and practical housing ; supporting the technological transformation of enterprises and the industrialization of high technology ;  
The Chongqing Municipality has proposed to make efforts to do well four major things like the task of migrating people out of the Three Gorges Reservoir areas , the reform and development of state-owned enterprises , the development of rural economy , and the construction of ecological environments , take an active part in the Big West Development , constantly strengthen its economic strength and city functions , and strive to realize the strategic objective of " building Chongqing into an economic center in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River . "  
In the aspect of agriculture and rural areas , the regional party committee and government have actively readjusted the production structure of agriculture and on the basis of conducting in-depth investigation and study formulated the opinions of the autonomous region about readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure of agricultural products and pushing forward the industrialized operation of agriculture and proposed that farm production should focus on improving quality and uphold the unification of output , quality , structure , and effectiveness .  
During the busiest season of spring plowing and the golden period of industrial production , the party and government leaders of Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region went deep into the rural and pastoral areas and industrial and mining enterprises to help farmers and herdsmen with production activities like spring plowing . resisting disasters and protecting livestock , and preventing diseases and helping enterprises resolve problems confronting them , thus vigorously promoting the economic and social development in the whole region .  
Wen Jiabao says after more than 20 years , China 's rural reform has achieved huge success .  Agriculture 's comprehensive productive capacity has scaled one height after another ; the peasants ' living standard has clearly improved , and the outlook of the rural society has undergone dramatic changes .  
One , we must take a stronger mass viewpoint and forge closer party-masses relations : To uphold the mass viewpoint in rural work , it is vital that we uphold the basic aim of serving the peasants with our hearts and minds , uphold the basic criteria of protecting the peasants ' material interests and respecting the peasants ' democratic rights and privileges , and insist on the basic starting point of raising the peasants ' living standard . 
We must take further steps to integrate ideology with the Central Committee 's plans and requirements , increase understanding , strengthen confidence , take hold of opportunities , take prompt action , and conscientiously launch this round of study and educational activities in order to provide strong ideological and organizational assurances for progress in agricultural , rural , and peasant work .  
Doing a good job with this round of study and educational activities will further raise the quality of base level rural cadres , strengthen the powerful impetus of the cohesiveness of rural grassroots Party organization and fighting effectiveness .  Moreover , it will strengthen the building of rural grassroots organization thereby guaranteeing thorough implementation of the important rural grassroots level organization required by the " three represents " .  
The various Party Committee levels must take firm hold of the beneficial opportunity afforded by this round of study and educational activities , blend the important " three represents " ideological study and education with the frequent work needed for grassroots organization building and work hard to start new aspects of rural grassroots organization building work .  
This association has basically established organizations in urban and rural areas , at the grass roots , in industrial enterprises and institutions , and in places where the transient population is concentrated .  Most associations are capable of giving play to their roles in varying degrees .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
Hence , the increase of peasants ' income in every possible way should be taken as the basic objective of promoting agriculture and rural economic structural adjustment and the fundamental task of agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and placed in a prominent position of the entire economic work .  
Today , people 's consumption in both urban and rural areas has changed from " satisfying the basic needs for food and clothing " to improving the quality of life and seeking all-round individual development .  
All localities must persist in buying the peasants ' surplus grain at protected open prices , attach great importance to lightening the peasants ' burdens , vigorously promote the strategic restructuring of agriculture and rural economy , actively and steadily develop small towns , and achieve relatively rapid increase of peasant incomes.We must push the major development of west China in a thoroughly sound way .  The western development is a major decision of the CPC Central Committee for taking on the overall situation and facing the new century .  
We must uphold economic development as the center , and integrate spiritual civilization construction work with city and rural development work , as well as with business work for all industries and trades .  We must put efforts into raising the ideological and moral quality of people , and also their science and cultural quality , thus providing spiritual motivation and ideological assurance for modernization construction .  
China is a vast country with a population of over 1.2 billion people , and broadcasting has close ties with the thinking , work and life of the masses .  The role of broadcasting can not be overlooked or replaced in the urban and rural areas , especially in the remote agricultural and pastoral areas .  Broadcasting has a great promise and a great future .  
We must vigorously push forward the strategic readjustment of the agriculture structure and the rural economic structure , gear agriculture and the rural economy to the market , rely on science and technology , focus on raising the quality of agriculture products , optimize regional distribution , carry out processing and conversion , and develop industrial management of agriculture .  
Since 2000 , all regions and departments in the country , acting in accordance with the plan of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the requirements they set for agriculture and rural economic development in the new stage , have earnestly carried out the party 's rural policies .  They have strengthened the role of agriculture being the foundation of the national economy , and they exerted great efforts in promoting the restructuring of agriculture and the rural economy .  Agriculture and the rural economy are now developing steadily and have had many positive changes .  
We must profoundly understand the extreme importance of increasing peasants ' incomes , press forward despite the difficulties ahead , and regard restructuring and increasing peasants ' incomes as the central assignments and basic objectives of our rural work at the new stage to be accomplished and attained with firm resolve .  
The meeting stressed : The central authorities ' decision that county and city departments and village cadres across the country must carry out the education program of studying the important thinking concerning the " three represents . "  This is an important policy decision for improving grassroots cadres ' competence and increasing the coherence and militancy of grassroots party organizations in the rural areas under the new situation .  It is also an important move for strengthening and improving the party 's leadership over rural affairs and promoting rural areas ' economic development and social progress .  
The rural market information system will be established and perfected .  The agricultural quality standards and monitoring system will be set up at a quicker pace .  The work of formulating and revising trade standards and local standards for agriculture will be further advanced .  
The reform of rural credit cooperatives should limit to correcting the direction of persistently serving " three aspects of agriculture " ; and should strive to attain the goal of clearly defining relations between ownership and management , improving and perfecting the structure of management by legal persons , guarding against financial risks , changing the management style , reinforcing internal management , and keeping bad debts and operational losses under strict control .  
Enabling peasants to get rich as quickly as possible is not only an important matter concerning reform , development , and stability in the suburbs of the capital , but also an important matter concerning the overall economic and social development in the capital .  Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to this matter , take it as a top priority and the basic objective of the agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and make great efforts to accomplish this task .  
It is necessary to actively study the regularity in the operation of agriculture and the rural economy in the new stage , adopt effective measures according to the local conditions to develop the market-oriented rural economy by bring local advantages into play , raising the quality and efficiency of farming production in suburban areas , and developing agriculture in scope and in depth .  Thus income can be increased in the process of strategic economic restructuring .  
Through the implementation of the party 's rural policies and in-depth reforms , we should effectively protect , arouse , and give play to the initiative of the peasants .  This is the main driving force for increasing their income .  At the same time , the advantageous technological and intelligent conditions in the capital should be brought into full play ;  
Municipal , district , county , township and town governments and all social circles should continue to increase the effectiveness of supporting and protecting agriculture .  In particular , while changing the backward conditions of the rural infrastructure facilities and improving the farming production conditions , it is necessary to give policy guidance to the peasants , encouraging them to become main investors and operators in the farming industry , and thus enlivening the rural economy as a whole .  
The theme of the current meeting is to energetically push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution and accelerate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency in a bid to provide scientific and technological support to the agricultural and rural economic development in the new stage .  
On the one hand , China 's agricultural and rural economy has entered a new stage , as agricultural development has changed from the restriction by resources in the past to the dual restriction by resources and markets ; the problems of irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low agricultural comprehensive effectiveness , slow growth of peasants ' income , and so on are increasingly conspicuous , which have set new and higher demands on agricultural scientific and technological development .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
In the coming 10 to 15 years , we must strive by every possible means to resolve the scientific and technological problems in terms of optimizing agricultural structure , heightening agricultural efficiency , improving rural ecological environment , augmenting international competitive power , and so on to facilitate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency .  
It means developing the production of quality farm produce , quickening the pace of developing the processing industry for farm produce , promoting agricultural industrialized operation , optimizing agricultural and rural economic structure , heightening the scientific and cultural level of the vast number of peasants , and broadening the channels to increase peasants ' income through furthering the scientific and technological advancement .  
Agricultural development has changed from the resource constraint of the past to the dual constraint of resources and market ; problems such as irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low comprehensive returns on agriculture , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes are becoming more conspicuous by the day , and these set new and still higher demands on the development of agricultural science and technology .  
We must vigorously propagate and popularize scientific knowledge , scientific thinking , and scientific methods ; guide the masses of cadres in building scientific , civilized , and healthy social trends and fine lifestyles ; and constantly meet the growing cultural needs of the masses of peasants , thereby promoting the two civilizations in the rural area .  
Under the current situation in which the standard of China 's rural productive forces is fairly low , it is difficult to carry out agricultural scientific research and development without government support .  
It has been learned that , despite that poverty relief and development efforts made over the last few years have noticeably alleviated the poverty and backward situations in the vast poor rural areas and noticeably increased incomes of the poverty population , the average income of the poorest population in rural areas is still less than one third of the per capita income of peasants of the country .  Besides , the gap of incomes of peasants in developed and poor regions not only has not narrowed , but , on the contrary , has further widened .  
Beginning in 2000 , the task will be pressing and arduous to continue to ensure sufficient food and clothing for the low-income populations living in poor rural areas who have not had sufficient food and clothing and those who have initially but not stably had sufficient food and clothing , and for the people living in poverty mainly in old revolutionary areas , minority nationality areas , pastoral areas , frontier areas , and other particularly poor areas ; and the task of preserving the results of poverty relief and development will be as pressing and arduous .  
If there is a long-term drop off in grain prices , the readjustment of the agricultural structure will be delayed , the shift of the surplus rural workforce will be impeded , and it will be impossible to boost the income of the farmers , which may result in a setback to the enthusiasm of the farmers and shake the agricultural foundation , thus jeopardizing the entire national economy .  
The party committees at all levels should fully understand the momentous and far-reaching significance of the current " study and education " activities , further integrate their thinking with the major policy decisions of the central authorities , use the idea of " three represents " to lead and assume overall responsibility for the agricultural and rural work , strengthen leadership , organize the work carefully , seek actual results , and have a good and firm grasp of the " study and education " activities conscientiously .  
- - Comprehensively implementing the strategy of industrializing the agricultural operation , improving the processing and transformation level of agricultural products , and enhancing the extension effect of agriculture .  The province will actively spread new operational forms in its rural areas , such as linking industrial companies with farming households and introducing an orders-based agriculture ;  
In medium-sized and small cities and small towns , by developing various kinds of industrial zones producing local specialty products , we will actively induce and centralize township and town enterprises to establish processing , construction , and service industry with local special flavor .  We will use industrial centralization and development as a driving force to prompt rural population to migrate to urban areas in a reasonable and orderly manner .  
However , the realization of socialist modernization in rural areas can not rely on empty talk or idle waiting , but can only rely on our painstaking and unswerving efforts with innovations and efficiency .  Only by making such efforts can we usher in a bright future .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : Since last year , a number of counties and cities in Anhui Province and other provinces and autonomous regions have carried out the trial reform of taxes and charges in rural areas in accordance with the arrangements made by the party Central Committee and the State Council , and have achieved initial good results .  First , the peasants ' burdens have been reduced by a great extent and the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " has been effectively curtailed .  
The reform policy is to tackle the current actual situation in rural areas , and is supported by the broad masses of peasants and cadres at the grassroots level .  It is a policy to fundamentally solve the problem of the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " in rural areas , to reduce the peasants ' burdens , and to protect and whip up the peasants ' enthusiasm for production .  
We should guarantee the normal operation of political power at the grassroots level and establish a supervising and managing system for the reduction of peasants ' burdens .  We should continue to straighten up wanton collection of fees by middle and primary schools in rural areas , wanton collection of water and power charges in rural areas , apportioning of fees for newspaper , and demanding money and things for activities in order to achieve certain targets .  
Responsible persons of various provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the central authorities , and the Xinjiang Production-Construction Corps ; responsible persons of concerned ministries and departments of the party Central Committee , the National People 's Congress and the State Council ; and responsible persons of offices of leading groups of financial and agricultural departments and commissions of various provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities for the reform of taxes and charges in rural areas attended the meeting .  
According to Anhui province 's statistics , since the fee-to-tax reform was implemented , the agricultural two taxes and their attachments collected by the province were reduced 23.6 percent from what was collected in agricultural tax , agricultural unique product tax , township joint planning and village withdrawals before the reform was implemented .  Implementing this reform , combined with abolition of the butchery tax and rural educational fundraising raising , meant the total tax and fee burden for farmers dropped by 31 percent .  
Since opening and reform were implemented , China 's rural operating system has undergone fundamental changes , but administrative system reform has lagged behind , meaning it could not meet the demands of rural market economic development .  
At the same time , it encourages grassroots authorities in the countryside to alter their functions as development of the socialist market economy demands .  It has downsized township institutions and staff , promoted village self-administration , improved the rural administrative system , and made the rural superstructure better fit the changed economic foundation .  
The key to success for rural fee-to-tax is whether we can carry out the central government 's policy well from the view point of implementation ; and the core of this is strictly assessing and determining farmers ' burden in a fair and rational way in accordance with policy regulations , for the ultimate goal of the reform is to practically cut down farmers ' burden .  
A national forum for the members of the first batch of supervision and inspection groups concerning study and education activity of the important thinking of the " three represents " in rural areas has just concluded today .  This reporter has learned from the forum that upon the approval of central leading comrades , the first batch of six supervision and inspection groups , which are respectively headed by provincial-level veteran comrades , will soon leave for 12 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities to supervise and inspect the progress of the study and education activity there .  
In particular , we must regard increasing the peasants ' income as the focus of agricultural and rural work , as the main task to tackle in developing the rural economy , and as an important yardstick to measure the results of the " three represents " [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] study and education activities in rural areas .  
In conducting such activities , we must have our eyes on improving the overall quality of the broad masses of rural grass-roots cadres , on solving existing conspicuous problems in rural areas , and on safeguarding and increasing the fundamental interests of the broad masses of peasants .  Such study and education must be closely linked with promoting rural work .  
The opera displayed the importance and urgency of changing cadres ' work styles , making coherent the people 's feelings , and straightening out the party styles and social atmosphere in the new period .  The opera was simple and vivid with a touching story .  It had strong artistic influence and educational effect , and was a very strongly practical drama for implementing education in party styles and honest administration in grass-roots rural areas .  
It is necessary to strengthening public health work in rural areas , more effectively prevent and control the incidence of major diseases , infectious diseases , and endemic diseases .  In particular , public health guarantee capacities in the western part of the country must be enhanced .  Reforms of the medical insurance system for urban workers , institutional reforms of the medical institutions , and the reform of the pharmacy circulation system should all be further advanced actively .  
Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .  As a result of the insufficient financial input in rural public health undertakings , many grass-roots hospitals and clinics remain in very poor conditions .  Buildings are simple and crude ;  
equipment is obsolete and outmoded ; technical and professional human resources are insufficient .  The unreasonable distribution of public health resources in rural areas has affected the development of public health undertakings in the vast countryside .  
the layout of rural medical and health care institutions will be readjusted , with the current layout based on administrative regional division being changed ; all existing medical and health care facilities will be put under unified management in the whole trade ; in the same township , the health care station and the guiding station for family planning can share resources .  
The lawbreaking and illegal activities of making and selling counterfeit and inferior medicines have not been effectively checked and prevented .  Some illegal drugs which have been banned are still being sold in fair markets , and may directly threaten the safety of the consumers , especially the masses in rural areas .  
The motion was advanced by the 114 deputies of the Anhui delegation to the NPC session .  It holds that , at this critical moment when tax for fees reform and regulating funds for public undertakings in rural areas will be fully carried out , it is imperative to establish a system for sharing compulsory education funds between the central and local authorities according to a certain proportion in order to prevent peasants ' excessive burden and consolidate the results of the trial of tax for fees reform at selected places .  
We should strive to maintain social stability by intensifying our efforts at the comprehensive improvement of public order in the urban and rural areas and strike hard at gangster forces and all kinds of unlawful practices and crimes .  
Delegate Yao Qiong , Chairwoman of the Women 's Federation from the Daozhengelao minority autonomous county , proposed expansion of educational forces on behalf of national minorities in impoverished areas , increasing support for a new round of development in the area of poverty relief , strengthening cadre training at basic levels in rural areas , and promoting the overall development of rural economies .  
He says : Anhui and some other local areas have been quite successful in launching pilot projects of reforming their tax and fee collection systems .  The pilot projects have set the financial obligations for the peasants , the state , and the collectives ; effectively reduced the peasants ' burdens , and stopped the collection of unwarranted levies , fines , and obligations in the rural areas .  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " sums up our nation 's abundant practical economic experience , identifies the major problems to be resolved as well as the major areas for development , and proposes a direction in which to work and corresponding policy measures .  For example , with respect to strengthening the basic position of agriculture and promoting the comprehensive development of the rural economy , the ' outline ' makes 6 policy decisions : Protect and improve grain production capacity ; expand areas in which rural people can increase their income ;  
In urban areas , a sound old-age security system needs to be established , with basic old-age insurance , basic medical insurance , business insurance , social relief , social welfare , and mutual social aid as its major contents .  As for rural areas , they are required to carry out the work towards the aged mainly in the form of family-based old-age care ;  
Making agricultural adjustment is not to decide which crops should be emphasized and which crops should be less emphasized .  We should raise the quality of agricultural products in an all-round way , improve geographical layout , and realize sustained development and a coordinated development between urban and rural areas .  
In his speech , peasant representative Wang Guangping from Dongxing Village , Dongxing Township , Dingyuan County , said : The rural tax and fee reforms have ensured that the burdens on peasants are reduced and standardized the behavior of tax collection and management in rural areas .  Peasants are genuinely happy about this .  We hope this policy , which benefits the people , will be kept consistent and be continuously perfected , with supporting policies introduced .  
Nine hundred million of the total of over 1.2 billion people are in the rural areas .  The key to expanding domestic demand lies in developing the rural market , trying by every possible means to increase the peasants ' income , and turning the potential purchasing power in rural areas into actual purchasing power .  
Lu Ming spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association : From the high plane of the modernization program , we should reexamine the importance of the question of agriculture , rural areas , and peasants at the current stage , draft agricultural policies , and coordinate other policies in light of the requirements of laying stress on , supporting , and developing agriculture .  
He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
While attending the discussion meeting of the Jilin delegation , Wen Jiabao , member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council , said that great importance must be attached to the issue of peasants ' income .  It is necessary to try by all possible means to increase peasants ' income , and take this as the basic objective of doing a good job in the agricultural and rural work in the new stage and put this in a prominent position in the economic work as a whole .  
It calls for acting in line with the requirements of the " three represents , " attaching prime importance to resolving relevant issues related to people 's immediate interests , including striving to increase the incomes of urban and rural residents , especially low-income people in the urban areas and the incomes of peasants .  It also calls for expanding employment , improving the social security system , optimizing the consumption environment , raising the quality of living , and resolving the food and clothing problems of those people who are still living in poverty .  
Wu Minghui said that an obvious feature of the current system of residence registration , which was developed under the planned economy , especially the system of the unified purchase and marketing of grain , is that it totally separates the urban population from the rural population .  The demarcation is very distinct .  
The main reasons for China to increase its national defense spending this year is to ensure that the living standard of the servicemen will improve simultaneously with social and economic development and with the increase in the average income of urban and rural residents , and to meet the needs of the modernization of national defense and the reform of the military management structure .  
" Not only will it ease the pressure originating from the surplus of rural labor force , help raise the peasants ' income , divert a large number of redundant laborers to the secondary and tertiary industries , and strongly expedite agricultural restructuring , but also it will check haphazard influx of rural population into large cities , promote economic development , and forward urbanization . "  
If we have steady agricultural development , peasants will live in happiness and rural areas will be prosperous .  If such being the case , the state will enjoy a stable situation and the world will be peaceful .  China 's history has proven this over the past several thousand years .  
Peng Peiyun pointed out : Following the tax-for-fees reform , surcharge for education and social collection of funds have been canceled .  The income of township and town finance has decreased , and the new agricultural tax has not clearly stipulated the proportion of tax for compulsory education in rural areas .  The system of financial transfer by financial department at the higher level also has not been properly established .  
We should deepen reform of credit associations in rural areas and improve financial services .  We should continue the work of helping poor areas through development and formulate new plans to help poor areas .  We should lay stress on helping poor people in central and western regions resided by minority people , in old revolutionary base areas , and in border and especially poor areas .  
We should continue to increase investment in education , ensure the basic need in promoting compulsory education in rural areas , support the construction of foundation facilities for schools of higher learning , develop middle and high level professional education , strengthen vocational and technical training , and encourage people in the society to run schools .  
Promoting comprehensive economic and social development , properly building the material and spiritual civilizations , making efforts to promote the coordinated development of the urban and rural areas and of different regions , keeping economic development , population , resources , and the environment in line , and bringing about sustainable economic and social development are the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , are important expression of our party 's " three represents " thinking , and are also the direction for the process of socialist modernization which we must firmly grasp .  
We should make it our objective to increase the income of urban and rural population and constantly meet the people 's material and cultural needs , and vigorously promote the comprehensive development of the national economy and social undertakings .  
Third , the urban and rural structure will be adjusted , the process of urbanization will be advanced steadily and positively , the rate of urbanization in the whole province will be raised to a level close to the national average .  
When the first NPC was called , there were only four special committees .  And when the Ninth NPC was called , the number of special committees was already increased to nine unfolding works in the areas of education , science , culture and public health , law , internal and judicial affairs , nationalities , environmental and resources protection , finance and economy , overseas Chinese affairs , foreign affairs , agriculture and rural affairs in accordance with law and the wishes of the people .  
As stressed at the session , strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the economy and increasing the farmers ' income must be considered as economic tasks of prime importance .  It is imperative to speed up agricultural and rural economic restructuring , energetically promote the industrialized operation of agriculture , vigorously conduct rural reforms in all fields , truly reduce the burdens on farmers , continue the help-the-poor work in rural areas , and take positive and steady steps to proceed with the urbanization program .  
Zeng Qinghong stressed : We must push forward in depth the study and education activity on the important thinking of " three represents " in rural areas , strive to meet the prescribed targets in real terms , and further make people 's ideological understanding on the activity conform to the requirements of the central authorities .  
Wen Jiabao went down to the fields to observe the way crops sown in late autumn were growing and the preparations for plowing and sowing of crops in the spring ; visited peasant households to acquainted himself with the livelihood of the masses ; and had discussions with cadres at grassroots level and farmers to study measures of restructuring agriculture , developing the rural economy , and increasing farmers ' income .  
He pointed out : Taking agricultural restructuring and the increase of farmers ' income as the basic target and major task of the current agricultural and rural economic work is a correct policy decision made by the central authorities after having made a thorough analysis of the situation of agriculture and the rural economy in the new period .  Restructuring agriculture and the rural economy is not only an important way to increase farmers ' income but also a strategic measure to comprehensively improve the overall quality and efficiency of agriculture and carry out agricultural modernization .  
In accordance with the unified plans of the central authorities regarding the launching in the rural areas of in-depth educational activities based on the important " three represents " idea , we must organize grass-roots cadres in studying and understanding the central authorities ' policies concerning the reduction of the burden on peasants , enhance their policy awareness and legal mindedness , improve their work style , and boost their initiative in implementing the policies .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that the important " three represents " idea study and education activities being launched among county ( city ) departmental cadres and town and village cadres throughout the country is a major move aimed at raising the quality of grass-roots cadres in rural areas , enhancing the rally force and fighting capacity of grass-roots party organizations in rural areas , and promoting social and economic development in rural areas under the new situation .  
First , it is necessary to link such activities with developing the rural economy and guiding farmers to free themselves from poverty and achieve a better-off level of moderate prosperity .  It is necessary to firmly instill grass-roots cadres in rural areas with the idea of taking economic development as the central task and to make them concentrate their energy on developing the rural economy and on raising farmers ' incomes .  
Second , it is necessary to link such activities with the promotion of spiritual civilization in rural areas , to heighten in an all-round way the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the masses of cadres and people in rural areas , and to provide economic and social development in rural areas with an ideological guarantee , spiritual motive force , and intellectual support .  
In North District , the Social Welfare Department and North District Office will continue to foster a close and cordial relationship at district level with various rural committees and to provide briefings about various welfare services to them and pass on to rural residents information on welfare services through the relationship network built up by the villagers with residents in remote areas .  
The Government 's policy objective on the environmental well-being of the community is to improve our urban , rural and marine surroundings , conserve our natural heritage , and optimise the use of resources and goods so as to reduce pollution and waste and promote health and the enjoyment of our living environment .  
On rural elections , Mr Lan said a Government working group is now looking at how current practices can be improved taking into account the dual objective of balancing traditional rural interests and the need for open , fair and clean elections .  
At present , China is making strategic readjustment to its economic structure and speeding up the readjustment of its industrial setup , regional structure , urban and rural structure and ownership composition .  China has given prominence to the development of science , technology and education , accelerated the informatization of national economic and social progress , strengthened environmental protection , expedited township development and improved public service system .  
" In order to strike a proper balance between the operational needs of the trade and the importance for avoiding adverse environmental impacts and nuisances of such uses to the nearby residents , the Board has formulated a strategy for tackling issues related to the consideration of applications for temporary open storage and port back-up uses in the rural New Territories , " the spokesman explained .  
Regarding the dispatching of Department of Health 's mobile dispensaries , floating clinics and flying doctors to provide medical services to residents living on outlying islands and certain remote areas in the rural parts of the territory , will the Government inform this Council :  
After more than 20 years ' development , with the provision of a total of nine hectares of land by reclamation or site formation , public facilities including a indoor sports centre , waterfront park , fire station , rural public housing estate , market complex , waterfront promenade and sewage treatment plant are built to greatly improve the quality of life of the local residents .  
Agricultural aid of the government has totaled NT $ 2,500 million in the last two and a half years . Another NT $ 1,480 million has been loaned to farmers for modernization projects . With agriculture booming , public and private institutions have been encouraged to provide another NT $ 2,100 million worth of investment in the rural economy .  
Story of a Small Town Mountains covered with fir woods and bamboo groves , frequently shrouded by mists and sharply divided by the sparkling Chingshui River , provide an idyllic setting for Tsaoling Village in central Taiwan . Its pastoral people , who earn their living through a resourceful array of specialized products , help further to induce an atmosphere of rural peace .  
Sometimes an old grandma can be seen sitting by a cradle humming a lullaby . The leisurely and pleasant air of rural villages in old China can still be sensed here . Sad to say , the rooms in the right wing between the fourth and fifth courts became so dilapidated that they were torn down a few years ago , and replaced by a two story western-style building .  
One is Oluanpi , a national park ; another is the small Maobitou peninsula . Situated across from a rural community , far from the hustle-and-bustle of the big cities , a very exotic tropical paradise overlooks the ocean : dark blue water for as far as the eye can see . A light blue sky and golden sand reflect the glimmer of the setting sun , a round ball of crimson hovering over the horizon .  
Outside Kaohsiung , in the southern part of Taiwan , in a rural , sleepy farming community , hidden amid rice paddies is a pleasant but imposing structure surrounded on all sides by a high wall .  
The rapid reduction in the sweet potato crop reflects two phenomena : First , the movement of the rural population to the cities . Even though the sweet potato does not require much care , its planting and harvesting still require lots of manpower . Second , although many poor-land fields were left unused , in rice-growing areas some paddy fields are used for both rice and sweet potatoes to make the most of natural conditions . Sweet potatoes can be grown between the two growing periods of paddy rice , getting full use out of a field .  
This combination of rivers and mountains lends a lovely rural ambience to the region . Ch'en Cheng-chang , town magistrate points out that bamboo thrives in warm , humid areas and Chushan , with its average elevation of 1000 meters and its southwest exposure , which ensures ample yearly rainfall totals , is ideal for successful bamboo growth .  
Puppet theatre has experienced difficult times as of late . A rural art , it lost much of its audience in the tremendous urbanization of the past twenty years . In addition , being educated has come to mean being Westernized for many people , leaving them to shun traditional Chinese art .  
The conference summarized its discussions in 11 conclusions , aimed at an ideal agricultural system including : a structure for agricultural policy with comprehensive powers , strong and capable farmers ' organizations , autonomous price regulation , stable agriculture profits , moderate trade protection , reasonable prices for inputs , continuous use of agriculture resources , a low-pollution environment , stable growth in agriculture , hygienic and safe agricultural products , and safe and healthy rural villages .  
Specialists commonly agree that the solution lies in combining small farms into large ones to achieve economies of scale and in promotion of planned production and sales , to economically utilize agricultural resources . Moreover , modernized construction should be strengthened in the rural areas to build villages with the potential to meet the needs of the time . This will solve problems of the farming population and the farming villages simultaneously . (  
In recent years it has become the custom to erect museums , galleries , and exhibition halls through private subsidy and ownership as opposed to setting up state-run facilities . Bands , dance troupes , orchestras , and puppet shows will continue to spring up and flourish at an astonishing pace . A prominent feature of our program for the future is the construction of libraries and audio-visual centers for every township and every rural district or village .  
Beautification of the environment , and urban and rural planning will receive toppriority attention . These newly planned community districts and zones will spring up everywhere and improve the quality of everyday existence . New edifices will include traditional Chinese architectural features , and space for outdoor activities will also be provided for the members of each community , such as playgrounds , parks , and gardens .  
We never thought we would buy a house in Hsichih , " says Hsiung Shu-hua , a public relations employee at Philips . She grew up in Hsichih but the place always seemed a bit of a backwater , awkward to get to and limited by its traditional rural economy , so when she got married three years ago she and her husband moved out to rented accommodation in Neihu .  
Modern Taiwan 's rural hinterland could hardly be expected to provide ethical regeneration and social harmony as it used to in the past , because concentration of the population in cities is already an established trend . But rural culture 's essential spiritual values can provide the basis for cultural development .  
In a commercialized society , with temple meetings in south Taiwan increasingly large , yi-chen are still not without a way out to survive . But with the gradual outmigration of the rural population , the trend of waxing and waning among community and professional chen can not , it seems , be altered .  
Altogether , there are probably no more than ten similar local drama troupes . Participants mostly have a sense that cultural development between the cities and the rural areas is too imbalanced : In Taipei arts groups are concentrated together and there are abundant performing arts . But elsewhere , after the powerful assault of the mass media , now everyone is bolted in front of the TV watching the same old TV personalities and plots that have nothing to do with their daily lives . Where have those dramas that reflect local life gone to ? "  
The maintenance of the basic rural village structure , plus leisure time and extra cash that people are willing to spend on cultural activities , is just like Taiwan shortly after retrocession , before any electronic or television media had become widespread , when local opera was definitely in its prime .  
In Fukienese rural villages , besides celebrations of the gods which have economic benefits in mind , state-sponsored dramatic operations have the responsibility of spreading the official line , as for example in modern dramas encouraging birth control or extolling some new positive and condemning the corresponding negative . These accompany the traditionally-costumed Hsiang Opera and are performed everywhere in turn .  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
But even though high-level medical technology ca n't be provided on location in these remote districts , where populations number in the hundreds , combined medical assistance should be sufficient , through telemedicine , mobile medical care , and public-sponsored rural physician visitation services , all of which have been carried out for many years , as well as the backup system of offshore military medical services .  
A woman who held a master 's degree married a husband who came from the rural south . On the first day of the marriage , in the kitchen of her motherinlaw 's rustic house , she faced a mountain of dirty dishes left behind by the visiting guests and relatives . She washed dishes until she cried .  
" From the 1960s and 70s , economic development began to affect Hualien , and Ami tribal society began to be ' marginalized . ' Songs such as this , which describe the emotional upheaval among tribespeople in a period of change , still preserve the typical rural color of Ami singing , but they also have acquired a touch of melancholy , " says Wu Ming-yi , who teaches at Yu Shan Theological College in Hualien , and who has been studying the changes in Ami songs for many years .  
To fulfill an election promise to eliminate garbage from Taoyuan 's cities , County Executive Annette Lu has , first of all , applied to the EPA to build two inter-area incinerators which would be operational in four years . Secondly , she has asked 13 cities , townships and rural townships to build small-scale sanitary landfills , and permitted and aided towns in establishing small-scale incinerators and local dumps , which can serve as stop-gap measures before the main incinerators are built .  
Liou has advertised the " baby oil series " as being free of complex or obscure meaning , taking it on frequent tours to rural areas in an effort to bridge the gap with audiences and make modern dance more accessible to the average person .  
In his thinking , the peasants have no month of rest and the life of the fields is one of exhausting hard labor . Yet he also saw the pleasure of rural life , when the peasants have finished work and " the children who were picking melons laugh and wash their feet at the water 's edge as the sun goes down , telling outrageous stories before the evening wind picks up . " This was a simple kind of leisure that the sophisticated literati were unable to appreciate .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
The next six provincial governors were all Taiwanese . During their terms in office , they put top priority on : developing local infrastructure ; providing better social services for workers engaged in agriculture , industry , and fisheries ; expanding the social safety net ; cleaning up local environments ; building planned communities ; accelerating rural development ; implementing the second phase of rural land reform ; providing full health insurance benefits for farmers ; reorganizing agricultural production ; and encouraging the use of more sophisticated agricultural technology .  
Moreover , in cities , interpersonal relations are often fluid and remote , and an untraditional woman is not likely to meet as much outside pressure . However , on the margins of the city or in the countryside , because interpersonal relations are so close , the conservativeness of couples , in-laws , neighbors , and colleagues creates a dense net . There will be tremendous resistance to any change in a marital relationship . Women in rural areas need to resolve these issues .  
After we passed through the city of Konosu , the scenery became very rural , with rice fields on either side of the road . Farmhouses dotted the landscape , rice seedlings were planted in neat rows in flooded paddies , wisteria vines were sprouting their first tender green leaves of spring , and eager tips of grass were just beginning to push up through the sleepy spring soil .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
Today 's senior citizens laid the foundation upon which Taiwan 's current success was built , but they 've been abandoned in these rural communities . We , their juniors , are an ungrateful generation . Q : Do you feel that transplanting the elderly to the city is a better solution ?  
The programming for these time slots was low-budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in Taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters-in-law and the like , or family comedies . Thus , for a long time , Taiwanese drama gave people the impression of being lowbrow .  
In China , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production . As this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year . Thus New Year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle .  
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .  
With their relatively low moisture content , the woody structure of Formosan acacias possess just the right degree of firmness , not at all like the damp and spongy wood of the Okinawa pine or the gunpowder trees commonly seen in rural northern Taiwan . The lower moisture content makes the heartwood of the acacia resistant to parasitic insects , allowing it to remain standing long after the tree 's outer layers have rotted away .  
Not the first time Each of these emerging bands has a style of its own , but they also have in common a way of combining homegrown and western styles of music . For example , Luan Tan 's beiguan-derived music alludes to the communal rural spirit of earlier times , something which is being rediscovered in the extra-curricular life of today 's students . It is a collective , pluralist mode of creation which contrasts starkly with the staleness of mainstream pop and illuminates new possibilities for music in Taiwan .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
The story is much the same when it comes to birds . Surveys of foreign starlings and mynas , also by TESRI , identified 13 non-native members of the family Sturnidae living wild in Taiwan , mainly escaped or released pets and their offspring . " White-vented mynas and common mynas have been recorded in over a third of Taiwan 's 361 urban townships , rural townships and city districts , " says a survey report by Lin Ruey-shing of TESRI .  
While he dedicated his life 's work to economic and technological development , he did not forget the importance of raising educational standards , narrowing the gap between urban and rural citizens and controlling population growth , and these were not overlooked in the promotion of his new ideas .  
During the war against Japan , Taiwanese Opera was prohibited on the mainland due to the fact that the land of its birth , Taiwan , was under Japanese colonial rule . Sai Yue-chin borrowed money left and right in order to flee to a rural inland area , where she performed on stage by night . The shows lasted until dawn , and the tough schedule brought on a serious gastric ailment for the frail Sai .  
This is a song of Kukeng Rural Township , written by a local resident . It accompanies newlyweds and couples from the rural township celebrating their golden and diamond anniversaries as they walk through a tunnel of densely packed foliage , symbolizing the continual revitalization of romance .  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
WTO membership will be a blow to many agricultural counties , but in recent years tourist farms have sprouted up . These new operations offer rural residents a new way to make a living by offering visitors a taste of specialty products and unique local cultural attractions . Many novel ideas , like liquor-producing towns , and farming villages specializing in vanilla and other local crops , have appeared .  
Like most young people , Robert Huang did n't figure he 'd be making it monstrously big in business , but opportunity came knocking when a group of friends from the Tunghai University department of architecture decided to found an architecture firm and build a residential division where people would be able to establish the close personal ties typical of traditional rural communities while still enjoying all the conveniences of modern apartment life .  
In the late 1960s and early ' 70s , rapid economic develop-ment in Japan triggered a lopsided concentration of population and infrastructure in that country 's urban areas , and a serious decline of rural towns and villages , as people flocked to the cities and misguided development schemes wrought havoc left and right . At the same time , the signing of a US-Japan security treaty spawned protests throughout the 1960s by university students concerned about the possibility of Japan returning to its former militarism .  
The little rural township of Luku , located in Nantou County , has a population of only 20,000 or so . Fifty-nine percent of the people are tea farmers . It is estimated that Nantou County accounts for one-third of the 18,000 hectares of land in Taiwan devoted to tea plantations , with Luku accounting for one half of Nantou 's total . Whether measured by cultivated area or production volume , Luku is the largest single tea-producing township in Taiwan .  
Ever curious about foreigners , the rural children were always bashful . In their eyes , in which black and white were so finely contrasted , and in their candid smiles , you could see the hope and future of their country . However , when they opened their mouths , it always made me feel uneasy , for they would always say , " Amiga !  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .  
In a society where " information equals power , " it is apparent that the gulfs between urban and rural , rich and poor will be increasingly difficult to traverse . Disparities in digital technology accordingly will become one of the world 's most controversial issues .  
In an effort to reduce the gap between rural and urban areas , and to respond concretely to cultural demand in counties and small cities , the Government Information Office ( GIO ) broke with a 26-year tradition and this year moved the Golden Tripod Awards ceremony out of Taipei City for the first time . It was held in Ilan County , where it was able to tap into local cultural characteristics and displayed a definite Lanyang Plain flavor .  
The Estate is not the only structure closely connected to the history of Wufeng to be in this condition . The Wan Fo Temple , a busy religious center that was located in the mountains behind the provincial assembly building , was once the largest Buddhist monastery and temple complex in the entire rural township . Its most distinctive feature was a 20-meter tall golden statue of Baisajyagurvaiduryaprabhasa in a seated position . Though the statue itself is still intact , the remainder of the structure was eradicated by the earthquake .  
In order to better understand the English-language education conundrum facing elementary schools throughout Taiwan , Control Yuan members Lu Hsi-mu , Lin Shih-chi , and Yin Shih-hao compiled an investigative report entitled " Problems in Elementary School English Education " at the close of last year . In it they discovered that rural schools were quite often unable to hire accredited English instructors .  
Although agriculture in Taiwan is generally on the decline and rural areas have been losing their young people , many of Kungkuan 's native sons and daughters who had left to pursue their educations or careers have recently been returning . In the same fields that their fathers and grandfathers tilled , they are now constructing European-style farms , traditional Hakka homesteads , and bright , modern farming villas . Apart from attracting tourists , they are recreating Kungkuan for themselves .  
They improvised and created as they progressed , though they modestly refuse to claim any great brilliance about the whole thing : " It 's just the basic instinct for working with your hands that most people who grow up on the farm have . " But there is something special about the work of these hardy rural folk . In comparison with the trite , commonplace nature of bamboo facades that you can see all over the place , there is a touching rustic charm to the Grass Academy .  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
When dengue fever was attacking southern Taiwan , the average health center in a rural township had only five employees . But communities there are spread widely and it required a great deal of time and personnel to visit each and every community and inspect outdoor containers of standing water , destroy carrier mosquitoes , and spray disinfectant .  
Indeed , in recent years , with the government promoting the reuse of neglected spaces ( much as it promoted " holistic community building " a few years earlier ) , the seeds of creativity and idealism have been planted in cities , towns and rural hamlets . Idle and abandoned century-old buildings , whether publicly or privately owned , have sprung to life again . Meanwhile , a connection has been discovered between preserving memories of the past and promoting the arts .  
There have long been radio stations-especially those that have a clearly defined regional identity and announcers with that down-home accent-which , after broadcasting a few popular songs , start in on sales pitches in fluent , authentic Taiwanese . These shows are especially attractive to elderly listeners in rural areas .  
In the nearly 60 years since the end of World War II , societies around the world have undergone breathtaking transformations . The tide of industrialization has carried hundreds of millions of rural youth away from the land to work in urban factories , bringing about the disintegration of the traditional multi-generational extended family . Without the cohesion and support of the clan , it is a tall order for these young people to build and maintain stable , happy , mutually reliant families .  
According to many environmental groups , experience with kitchen waste recycling in rural communities shows that during the initial stages , residents were unclear about what was to be recycled , and as a result kitchen wastes were provided without first draining them , or items such as stray toilet paper , chopsticks , and plastic bags were often found mixed in . This type of front-end problem with the collection system is relatively easy to correct using instruction and appropriate adjustments . The real headache turns out to be with the downstream processes .  
Meanwhile the assistant secretary-general of the Chinese Youth Development Fund ( CYDF ) , Xu Yongguang , also paid a visit to Nan in Hong Kong . The CYDF is most famous for " Project Hope , " which gave poor rural children a shot at education , and once Xu heard Nan 's ideas on classical education , he put into action a successor project for classical studies based around ancient poetry and classical texts .  
Fifty thousand people came to the just-completed Science Exhibition Center during the three days of the exhibition . Adults and children alike personally experienced all kinds of dynamic and static activities , including small-scale interactive simulations , inventions , camps for creative exchanges between urban and rural students , and forums on the process of creative practice .  
Chen Huai-en of the Department of Visual Communication Design at National Yunlin University of Science thinks that our aesthetic sensibility is still influenced by our rural past , and we have a scant aesthetic conception of foreign societies . He says that despite our hideous surroundings , a fair number of Taiwanese have developed a critical consciousness and are looking forward to an aesthetic society .  
The reporter learned from Guilin 's Flood and Drought Prevention Headquarter that over the past few days Guilin and its surrounding 12 counties ( autonomous counties ) saw heavy rain .  In Yongfu County , the water level was 4.45 meters above the warning line , cutting all roads linking the county town to rural townships .  
A major factor in the rural-urban shift in population is the real or perceived disparities between urban and rural areas in economic opportunities and in social and cultural amenities .  
In remote , rural areas , the programme was usually limited to the basic essential information , such as the meaning of the " red " and the " blue " ballots , and practice voting .  
A transition from the present energy supply of mainly firewood and animal and human power to a more diversified base and a better use of commercial energy was key to improving the living conditions of rural populations .  
Governments were requested to rationalize urban growth and improve the quality of life in rural areas through the promotion of integrated rural development programmes with economic , social and environmental dimensions .  
Fuller consideration must also be given to tapping the surplus rural female workforce within economic development , paying special attention to developing township enterprises that are suitable for women , while ensuring good and safe working conditions .  
In most developing countries , the direct impact is virtually inconsequential in light of the large numbers of poor who , often rural and either unemployed or underemployed , have little if any prospect to work for a foreign affiliate .  
The objective is to achieve adequate shelter for rapidly growing populations and for the currently deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling and environmentally sustainable approach to shelter development and improvement .  
These include defining the role of the African State and its institutions with the aim of sustaining political reform ; enhancing national cohesion ; improving the quality of economic governance ; and facilitating balanced rural and urban development .  
Indeed , sound management of rural and urban settlements can be the vehicle for overcoming many of the social , economic and environmental problems faced by all countries , industrialized and developing .  
An initial investment in social organization at the local level is followed by financial support to implement certain key communal projects which respond to priority needs identified by rural communities themselves .  
Measures should be taken to ensure wide dispersal of educational facilities across geographical space , at least up to the secondary school level , so that access of all women living in remote and rural areas is fostered .  
The Sudanese Government had prepared a comprehensive plan to combat poverty by raising rural living standards through economic and social development plans , with similar projects directed at poor urban dwellers .  
Factional fighting which broke out in Kabul , Afghanistan , on 1 January 1994 , continued throughout the year , causing renewed displacement and imposing a heavy burden on rural communities recovering from 15 years of war .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , Recalling chapters 7 and 28 of Agenda 21 , dd / adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the main objective of which is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor ,  
The Assistant Secretary-General then stated that rural human settlements issues should not be neglected , as the overall situation of the urban and rural poor had become worse , with 40 per cent more people living in absolute poverty compared to 15 years ago .  
While on the subject of youth issues , we should refer to the importance of devoting special attention to the neediest categories of society , especially the handicapped and those who live in rural areas in which only basic services are available to the young , as well as the inhabitants of areas with particular difficulties , such as those under occupation and those afflicted by armed conflicts .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Given the very low levels of per capita energy consumption in rural households in the developing countries at present , the absolute rise in residential energy consumption needs to be very rapid simply to satisfy basic human needs .  
The potential contribution of improved efficiency in meeting growing needs for energy services in a sustainable way in the rural areas of developing countries can be substantial , especially at the point of end use , by introducing new , efficient , low-polluting technologies and systems and by upgrading existing , inefficient systems .  
Economic development and increasing per capita incomes in rural areas may be expected to be accompanied by substantial increases in the consumption of fossil fuels not only in modernized agriculture and transportation but also in households , especially if prices in real terms remain as low as in recent years .  
In order to avoid even more serious and even catastrophic consequences for the rural environment and productivity , substantial increases in the use of fossil fuels for rural energy services will be unavoidable if modern renewable energy technologies can not make a major contribution to the rural energy mix .  
Another constraint is the lack of sustained political commitment to , and support of , the process of enhanced productivity , economic growth and social equity in rural areas .  This is often caused by a lack of long-term national energy strategies with the objective of balanced national economic and social development .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Deeply concerned about the lack of economic independence of rural women owing to their lack of access to land ownership , productive resources , and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and owing as well to inadequate professional and technical skills as a result of the restricted access of women to education , training and literacy programmes ,  
Expressing deep concern about the marginalization of rural women , especially young women with small children , women living in extreme poverty in rural areas and the sexual harassment experienced by , and the violence perpetrated against , them , including those in war-affected areas , as well as about the effect of male migrant workers ,  
Appeals to Governments to empower rural women , to be aware of and develop their potential and to actively engage , individually or in groups , in the fight for the enforcement of their rights , the improvement of their civil , personal and professional status , and the increasing of their representation in sufficient number in all policy-making , decision-making and consultative bodies and functions ;  
Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of a social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
" Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
To create a focus in national development plans and budgets on investment in human capital , with special policies and programmes directed at rural areas , the urban poor , women and children .  
The overall human settlement objective is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor .  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
Establish procedures to incorporate children 's concerns into all relevant policies and strategies for environment and development at the local , regional and national levels , including those concerning allocation of and entitlement to natural resources , housing and recreation needs , and control of pollution and toxicity in both rural and urban areas .  
National and local educational authorities and relevant United Nations agencies should expand , as appropriate , the use of audio-visual methods , especially in rural areas in mobile units , by producing television and radio programmes for developing countries , involving local participation , employing interactive multimedia methods and integrating advanced methods with folk media ;  
The Gambia noted that the high rate of rural-urban migration was a great concern for the Government ; the outflow had contributed towards aggravating congestion , worsening sanitary conditions , increasing unemployment and its effects on youth , and putting excessive pressure on social infrastructure in urban areas , as well as producing labour shortages in the rural areas .  
A main conclusion of this study is that eastern Kenya 's limited resource base and rapid rate of population growth require comprehensive rural and regional development planning .  
The representative replied that the mechanisms were focal points for rural development , education and popular participation , a few committees dealing with specific issues , various other connections at the societal and international levels and that the National Secretariat was represented in seven out of the nine provinces of the country .  
Members asked for concrete examples of temporary special measures , and whether any such measures were foreseen to correct the high illiteracy rate , the low employment rate of women and the low rate of participation of women in political decision-making or to protect indigenous and rural women .  
She indicated that the choice of method was directly linked to location ( urban or rural ) and to the level of education , with women living in urban areas and with a high level of education tending to choose modern methods . 
In reply to a question about concrete steps the Government had taken to raise the living standards of indigenous women , the representative said that the Government had primarily directed its efforts to supporting the basic needs of rural women .  
In her answer to the question concerning measures taken by her Government to ensure that the level of women 's representation in public life did not decline , particularly in rural areas , the representative said that legislation in the Russian Federation contained no discriminatory rules limiting the participation of women in the political life of the country .  
In that connection , the Office had submitted to the legislature a preliminary bill on domestic workers designed to protect young women from rural areas who were engaged as domestic servants and who , as a result of deep-rooted cultural discrimination , were denied the minimum social benefits provided under the General Labour Act .  
Promote changes in attitudes , structures , policies , laws and practices in order to eliminate all obstacles to human dignity , equality and equity in the family and society ; and promote full and equal participation of urban and rural women , and women with disabilities , in social , economic and political life , including in the formulation , implementation and follow-up of public policies and programmes ;  
Economic opportunities for rural women should be improved through elimination of legal , social , cultural and practical obstacles to women 's participation in economic activities and ensuring that women have equal access to productive resources .  
Access to credit by small rural or urban producers , landless farmers and other people with low or no income should be substantially improved , with special attention to the needs of women , and disadvantaged and vulnerable groups by :  
This migration is mainly a shift from rural to urban areas within developing countries , but also as continued high levels of migration flow between countries , and increasing interregional migration - particularly from developing countries with poor , fast growing populations , to developed countries .  
They typically possess limited institutional and human resource capacity to assess the implications for sustainable agricultural and rural development of ongoing developmental plans .  
In all countries , policies oriented towards promoting food and agricultural production and rural development and raising or maintaining farm incomes , while protecting the natural resource base , need to be coherent , consistent and mutually supportive ;  
Another programme that previously focused on small-scale , on-farm efforts in the use and conservation of water and soil resources and on traditional dryland crops has recently expanded to also cover off-farm common property resources and the development of viable alternative livelihood systems in marginal rural areas .  
ECA provides advisory services and support to its member States on agriculture and rural development policies , planning and programming , with a focus on measures for the conservation of natural forests and their biodiversity , desertification and the related conservation of biodiversity , the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and green belts in targeted countries , and the strengthening of regional cooperation programmes for the optimum and sustainable use of inland and marine fisheries .  
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
Increased public and private investment in agricultural infrastructure , including irrigation and drainage , rural energy , transport and markets will be required ; in this connection , a long-term plan should be developed to reclaim the 10-million square kilometres in Africa lost to tsetse fly infestation .  
The large and growing number of children who , due to rural exodus , extreme poverty , abandonment , as well as situations of violence within the family , are forced to live and / or work in the streets , are deprived of their fundamental rights and exposed to various forms of exploitation , is a matter of deep concern .  
Increase budgetary allocations for basic health and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the health of girls and women and to rural health programmes ; ( b ) Develop innovative approaches to funding health services through promoting community participation and local financing .  
In the developing countries , conceptual and methodological constraints and conventional labour force definitions and statistical systems still do not adequately reflect women 's productive work in the non-market economy , as producers in subsistence agriculture and in the urban and rural informal sector .  
By contrast , many traditional manufacturing industries , particularly those located in rural areas which are more numerous , more labour intensive and employ a larger proportion of women , especially during slack periods in the agricultural cycle , have stagnated under the pressure of increased competition . 
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
This has been a critical step forward in the context of translating project-induced increases in agricultural productivity and often a strengthened resource base into adequate diets for rural poor households .  
In the rural areas , where they are predominantly located in most of the developing regions except Latin America , they are the landless or near-landless illiterate agricultural workers , nomads , fishermen , pastoralists and forest dwellers who eke out a subsistence income from seasonal agricultural employment or from marginal lands and forests or from low-income non-farm work .  
Many countries allocate considerable proportions of public expenditures for food subsidies , but the bulk of those allocations go to civil servants , the police , families of the armed forces , and factory employees - in sum , largely to urban areas where they benefit middle - income groups , while the rural and urban poor benefit only marginally .  
For the rural poor who constitute the bulk of the poor in developing countries and who are unskilled and illiterate , the most effective approach to providing them with productive assets is agrarian reform - redistribution of land and reform of tenancy laws . 
It is generally recognized that the capacity of agriculture to absorb the growing labour force on a long-term basis is limited in most of the developing countries with a high incidence of rural poverty by the sheer unavailability of additional arable land . 
The budgetary burden will increase in the short and medium terms in connection with the extension of economic and social infrastructures to the rural areas and the unserviced urban periphery and inner-city slums where the poor are living .  
The objective is to assist the large numbers of the homeless and those living in poor shelter and unhealthy neighbourhoods , whether in urban slums and squatter areas or in poor rural areas , to meet their housing needs .  
The reports identify five major causes of increasing urbanization , all of which are about the search for better living conditions : rural unemployment and underemployment ; poor rural social services ; lack of arable land ; natural disasters , particularly drought ; and civil unrest .  
In a document UNCHS prepared for the Conference , on population , urbanization and quality of life , it underlined the positive effects of urbanization on social change and modernization , on fertility , mortality and other demographic trends , on personal and household income levels and on the general economic development of both the rural and urban areas .  
Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
All parties involved in the development process , including academic institutions , non-governmental organizations and grass-roots and women 's groups , should mobilize to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes directed towards the poorest and most disadvantaged groups of women , such as rural and indigenous women , female heads of households , young women and older women , refugees and migrant women and women with disabilities .  
Enhance the access of disadvantaged women , including women entrepreneurs , in rural , remote and urban areas to financial services through strengthening links between the formal banks and intermediary lending organizations , including legislative support , training for women and institutional strengthening for intermediary institutions with a view to mobilizing capital for those institutions and increasing the availability of credit ;  
Deeply concerned by the lack of economic independence of rural women owing to their lack of access to land ownership , productive resources , and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and owing as well to inadequate professional and technical skills as a result of the restricted access of women to training and literacy programmes ,  
Strongly appeals to all women , in particular rural women , to be aware of and develop their potential and actively engage , individually or in groups , in the fight for the enforcement of their rights , the improvement of their civil , personal and professional status , and the increasing of their representation in sufficient number in all policy-making , decision-making and consultative bodies and functions ;  
Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of any social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
During its special session ( 6-17 February 1995 ) on energy for rural development , the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development noted that adequate energy inputs were required for increased standards of living and productivity of human labour and for income generation in rural areas in developing countries where , on the eve of the twenty-first century , 2.5-billion people still have little or no access to commercial energy supplies and electricity .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
Structure services to reach rural and urban women involved in small , micro and medium-scale enterprises , with special attention to young , low-income , ethnic and racial minority , and indigenous women who lack access to capital and assets ;  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy and numeric problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Work under this subprogramme will be aimed at advancing consultations on the effects of adjustment policies , external openness and improved linkages with international markets on agricultural industries ; analysing the impact of increased participation by the agricultural sector in international markets on the public and private sectors ; and analysing recent experience in the agricultural land market , with special reference to the effects on promotion of small rural holdings .  
Such measures vary in range : pricing policies for agricultural inputs required by small farmers in raising their production ; policies regarding access to small credit facilities ; special measures required to make education accessible to children born in remote rural areas who participate in seasonal agricultural activities alongside adults ; elimination of legislative and bureaucratic barriers to the informal sector .  
The activities under this subprogramme will aim at strengthening the capability of ESCAP members and associate members in environmental and natural resource management ; integration of environmental considerations into economic policy decision-making ; transfer of environmentally sound technologies ; sustainable rural and urban development ; population and sustainable development ; and natural disaster reduction .  
Although they said that the main focus of UNICEF should continue to be in rural areas , several delegations stressed the need for UNICEF to emphasize poor populations living in such environmentally vulnerable areas as slums and marginal urban pockets .  
A regional project in southern Africa is providing training to managers and field workers in interpersonal communication skills and the use of low-cost audiovisual materials .  Rural radio remains the most effective mass medium to reach large numbers of rural audiences and FAO is continuing its efforts to strengthen rural radio services , especially in Africa .  
The ASEAN Population Programme covers training for population control , development of population information networks and studies on relevant issues ; the women 's programme addresses common problems such as illiteracy , lack of technical skills , poor nutrition and ill health , and strenuous workload especially among rural women .  SADC has established a culture and information sector whose main objective is to ensure the people 's involvement in the process of regional integration and development .  
Through its normative and field programmes at the global , regional , national and local levels in assessment and monitoring of land resources , policy and planning assistance , development and transfer of technologies , capacity building and demonstration in agriculture , livestock , forestry , fisheries and rural development .  FAO continues to contribute actively to desertification control , drought preparedness and mitigation and integrated dry land development in affected countries .  
This increase took place particularly in places close to the scene of intensified fighting and reflected the growing inability of both rural and urban populations to cope with the daily problems caused by the fighting , the collapse of social services and the unstable economic situation .  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
Lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health .  
Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Promote women 's economic independence , including employment , and eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of poverty through changes in economic structures , ensuring equal access for all women , including those in rural areas , as vital development agents , to productive resources , opportunities and public services ;  
NULLCooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the League of Arab States continued during 1994-1995 in technical fields of mutual interest in the areas of agriculture and rural development , natural resources and environment protection , human resources training and global economic and social development .  
An apparent alienation of the formal financial system from indigenous economic actors , especially in the rural areas , and in the urban informal sector and small-scale enterprises .  
The complex social and political circumstances of the rural human settlements indicates that the transfer of their productive , social and habitational infrastructure will remain an issue of particular delicacy , with a potential for aggravated social tension within the regions where they are situated .  
The event could also include an exposition of traditional and improved farmers ' instruments , artisanal products of rural communities from various parts of the developing world , a photo exhibit , stands for publications , a video show and a musical programme , while the African and international media would cover the event through national and satellite television networks .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The tangible benefits of this work were : increased quality production of salt ; enhanced income generation for rural women ; training and better information through the provision of simple technology ; and the use of solar evaporation methods leading to less deforestation and saving of foreign exchange when salt did not need to be imported .  
As a result of the sanctions , it has become increasingly difficult to satisfy minimum existential needs , especially in the case of the unemployed , the employed with low income and family income below a social minimum , pensioners with low pensions and family incomes , families with children , elderly rural households , etc .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The United Nations system 's operational activities for rehabilitation during the past year have focused on assisting local communities in rural infrastructure , food production , health improvement , animal health services , rehabilitation of disabled people and human settlements .  The main underlying purpose of these activities is poverty alleviation and human development .  
It noted that rural economic production was increasing from a very low base and that self-sufficiency in food production is achievable provided additional inputs to existing programmes are made available .  
40 Given the typical characteristics of rural areas , such as sparseness of population , lack of trained personnel , low initial demand and high costs of installing individual services , it was suggested that the introduction of enhanced information exchange in rural areas of Africa should be achieved through the establishment of telecentres where services would be pooled to serve the entire community .  
The objectives of the social , economic and technical strategies addressing the conditions of women in poor rural and marginal urban areas were to provide an immediate remedy for their survival needs , help them find economic options that improve their conditions , and propose strategies to achieve sustainable food security , safe energy sources , clean water , sanitation , and secure income to alleviate extreme poverty .  
In India , programmes to guarantee employment to the rural poor and unemployed youth , meet the nutritional , educational and health needs of women and promote their empowerment , and mass literacy programmes were central to the realization of situation-specific strategies .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ; 
contacts made a crucial contribution to the formulation of the highly relevant group projects listed below aimed at underpinning the educational system and supporting rural community economic development , including the delivery of primary health care and other services , and facilitating internships of UNETPSA and other graduates within the civil service . 
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
In its substantive programme actions , FAO continued to develop innovative interventions oriented towards increasing rural women 's access to and control of productive resources , especially through improved extension and training .  
Social services have an essential role to play in preventing the abandonment of rural areas and in seeing to it that services are available where people live and during the accelerated development of large urban areas ; they must ensure the functioning of infrastructure , such as roads and hospitals , built at high cost but threatened with collapse by a lack of will and of personnel able to maintain and manage them .  
The renewed decentralization at the level of urban and rural communes a total of 208 in the entire national territory formed the framework for basic development .  
The new Mission was able adequately to ensure the presence of the international community and the direct support of the United Nations for the peace process , especially in the areas that proved to be most critical to the implementation of the Chapultepec Agreement : public security , constitutional and legislative reform , the land-transfer programme and the transfer of rural human settlements .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .  
In the past four years the economy recorded an average growth rate of 8.2 per cent , resulting in increased employment opportunities and significantly rising living standards in the country , primarily in urban areas , where private enterprises are flourishing , and in fertile rural areas , where farmers have better incentive to grow and market their produce .  
With a population of fewer than 400,000 people of diverse ethnic and linguistic origins , 80 per cent of whom live in rural settings on hundreds of islands arrayed over 1,600 kilometres of ocean , no other system is workable .  
The desire to ensure effective democratization in national life and to foster development is at the core of the activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to benefit children , young people , women , indigenous and rural populations , the disabled and certain particularly disadvantaged urban groups .  
It is focusing on strengthening the institutional capacities of government , at both the central and local levels , with regard to policy management and poverty monitoring ; promoting human resources development by providing better access to health and education opportunities ; alleviating rural poverty ; and developing and strengthening the basic social-safety net , among other issues .  
Rural development and prosperity-decentralization in the region have been expedited by building up economic and social basic services to catalyse sustainable rural development and by expanding the quality and quantity of basic services to meet the local demands of the country .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) has focused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating progress in agricultural development , food security , human resources development , rural and urban development , the establishment and maintenance of infrastructures , the creation of the appropriate social environment , and the enhancement of regional economic cooperation .  
Further , it had established a family planning and education policy which allowed it , through mother and child public health services , to keep the population informed regarding every kind of health and nutritional problem , and it applied strict primary and community health care policies in villages and rural centres .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women , and ensure that they specifically address the special needs of girls and women , as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents ; the rural and urban poor ; persons in remote or neglected areas ; and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
A much-needed increase in productivity of rural areas of developing countries , in terms of agricultural output and processing , would require supplies of efficient , modern fuels for mechanized agriculture , rural transport and operating of essential tools and machineries . 
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .

Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;  
It was currently preparing an integrated plan of action to combat the so-called " paramilitary " groups that had sown death and terror in rural areas , and planned to reactivate a special armed group capable of tackling those groups successfully .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to provide Nicaragua , at the request of its Government , with all possible assistance to support the consolidation of peace , democracy and sustainable development in such areas as caring for displaced persons , land ownership and land tenure in rural areas , appropriate care for war-disabled persons , mine clearance and the overcoming of difficulties in the restoration of the productive areas of the country , and , in general , a process of sustained economic and social recovery and development so that the peace and democracy already achieved become irreversible ;  
The current supply of energy to rural areas of developing countries where the bulk of the population live is inadequate ; there is therefore an urgent need to expand substantially the supply of energy , including rural electrification , to stimulate economic growth or at least help arrest , reverse and eventually eradicate poverty , which is rampant in these areas .  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
Our present objective is to achieve adequate shelter for all and especially for the deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter that is environmentally sound .  
Such efforts can contribute to improving the linkage of rural settlements with the mainstream of economic , social and cultural life , to assuring sustainable communities and safe environments , and to reducing pressures on urban growth .  
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
Promote the active participation of all stakeholders , including those in isolated and remote communities , in ensuring the integrated consideration of the environmental , social and economic objectives of rural development efforts ;  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
The living and working conditions in all human settlements , including regional urban centres , rural service centres , rural hamlets , rural communities , market towns and villages , must be improved , with particular emphasis on shelter , social and physical infrastructure , and services .  
Consistent with local needs and conditions , such efforts should include improving human settlements management , encouraging the sustainable development of intermediate cities that create employment opportunities for unemployed rural labour , and providing environmental infrastructure .  
Provide equal access to basic education , while paying special attention to the poor and to youth living in rural areas , and addressing constraints created by distance , lack of educational facilities and social or economic barriers ;  
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Dispose , within both rural and urban areas by the year 2025 , of all sewage , waste waters and solid wastes in a manner in conformity with national or international environmental quality guidelines ;  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
Threats and intimidation continued to be directed against individuals and entities working for the protection of human rights by CVDC members and former military commissioners in rural areas and by unidentified groups operating in urban areas .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
Bearing in mind that the increasing number of women living in poverty in developing countries , especially in the rural areas and urban slums , requires the urgent action of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures at the national and regional levels towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , [ 2 ] / adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women ,  
Commends the efforts of the Institute to address all levels of poverty that hamper so dramatically the advancement of women , through the coordination of research and training activities in the areas of economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; communications ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , sanitation and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different population groups , such as the girl child , older women , displaced women , refugee and migrant women and women in rural areas ;  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed the willingness of his Government to take immediate , active steps to promote crop substitution and rural development , in close cooperation with UNDCP and other States , by purchasing products such as wheat , cotton and rice from Afghan farmers at prices higher than they could obtain from illicit crops , by contributing to road construction , and by assisting in preventive education and public awareness campaigns for Afghan farmers .  
In order to support the eastern and southern regions with planned rural development projects , the Department for Priority Regions for Development was established within the State Planning Organization , and based upon certain socio-economic criteria the 28 least developed provinces were identified and included in a specific programme within the planned development projects .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Conduct thematic studies to evaluate poverty alleviation strategies , especially with reference to women workers in the informal sector - on such themes as poverty , household food security and gender , focusing on the feminization of poverty as expressed in food insecurity ; conduct studies with respect to adapting successful credit systems in different socio-cultural areas , with particular emphasis on the needs of poor rural women , and to integrating information on credit systems into non-formal education ; undertake case-studies on the role of female entrepreneurs in the least developed countries ;  
From a water allocation perspective , water in aquifers and rivers has to be shared on three complementary levels : ( a ) local sharing between water-dependent sectors and users ( households , industries , irrigated agriculture ) ; ( b ) urban / rural sharing ; and ( c ) upstream / downstream sharing by sequential reuse .  
The evolution of an integrated land / water-oriented action plan to achieve a balanced development of the river system , taking into account all relevant factors ( demographic changes , ecological , socio-economic , hydrologic and hydraulic factors , and spatial and agronomic potentials of the basin ) and ensuring proper attention to urban / rural and upstream / downstream competition for water ;  
To strengthen the capacity of Governments at the national and local levels as well as of the private sector to manage the rapidly growing demand for infrastructure and services in urban and rural settlements in an economically efficient and environmentally and socially sustainable manner ;  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
If followed through to a logical conclusion , a multisectoral , system-wide programming approach could facilitate work with the vulnerable rural youth audience by dealing with all aspects of the drug problem through a number of simultaneous activities including programmes in formal and non-formal education and competency-based training , demand reduction , construction of health facilities and addressing related health issues , law enforcement and crime prevention issues , alternative crop production and other drug-related issues in any given country .  NULLOrganizational approach to developing a multiple agency ,  
The driving forces behind increasingly serious water problems include rapid world population growth - in terms of both rapid urbanization and rural populations growing beyond local carrying capacity - and rising expectations and dependence on reliable water-related services to meet social needs , economic activity and food production .  
Technical advisory services were provided by the Group on a variety of development issues , covering such areas as : inland water transport ; subregional cooperation for lake basin development ; implementation of the African Platform for Action on Women ; formulation of development priorities , programmes and projects ; economic cooperation and integration ; human resources development and utilization , and energy development ; criminal justice and crime prevention ; mineral resources and development ; agricultural development ; rural development ; industrial development ; and science and technology development . 
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
However new problems have been appearing in rural areas with respect to restitution of private land ownership , transformation of agricultural cooperatives and reduced opportunities to find a city job by women coming from the province in the form of requirements for requalification and / or new professions available to provincial women , e.g . , new forms of gainful employment executable at home .  
This policy statement , intended as a contribution by the world 's farmers to the World Food Summit , emphasized that in order to increase food production while at the same time assuring sustainable relationships with the natural environment and maintaining stable rural societies , farmers acting through their own organizations needed to take a central role . 
Only by means of a people-centred , participatory approach will effective transformation of the rural sector occur ; cooperative enterprise is one of the most efficient organizational vehicles for such transformation in developing regions - as it has been in the past when similar conditions existed in the rural economies of currently developed countries .  
Promoting ways to expand and intensify activities in the identification of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , especially in the regions not yet involved in ongoing initiatives , including special ways and means to assist developing countries in which forests and woodlands are essential in meeting basic subsistence needs of rural populations and forest-dwelling peoples ;  
In some rural areas , when police officers refused to deploy to outlying districts , citing lack of facilities and logistical problems , judicial and other local authorities frequently improvised by relying on locally elected officials ( CASEC ) or unofficial communal police , who sometimes worked in collaboration with HNP to carry out police duties .  
The activities of FAO in support of the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe and CIS concentrate on support for the implementation of economic and institutional reforms undertaken since the early 1990s as they involve and affect the agricultural and rural sector and , through assistance in approaching sustainable development , on support for the integration of the agriculture of these countries into the world economy .  
A major study on the role and status of rural women in the central and eastern European countries is instrumental in designing a plan of action to assist rural women in the transition and constituted a part of the preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 .  
Difficulties developed and delays again occurred in a number of areas , including the institutional consolidation of the public security sector ; the adoption of legal and constitutional reforms ; the reform of the judicial and electoral systems ; the transfer of land to former combatants ; and the transfer of rural human settlements to their current occupants .  
We reiterate that a comprehensive strategy in the fight against drugs must include the social and economic aspects of the phenomenon , to which end efforts must be directed towards alternative social and regional development programmes designed to help improve the living conditions of the rural families affected .  
On 11 April 1995 , the qualifications board of the Ignacio Agramonte lower secondary school dismissed \ x { 8072 } gel D \ x { 5adb } alo Machado from his post as a physics teacher for not participating in the activities of the escuela al campo ( a period of mandatory service by students in rural areas ) or in political activities , and for not paying dues to the official union .  
The conception of these national and regional work-sites has evolved and they now cover very diversified activities ranging from water and soil conservation , reforestation , sinking of shallow wells , and protection of archaeological sites in rural areas to the repair of public buildings , sanitation and hygiene campaigns , and beautification and development of towns .  
The programme is intended for poor people living in rural , urban and peri-urban areas and has the advantage of combining various components designed to mitigate the chief manifestations of poverty : underemployment and unemployment , lack of skills , and precarious living and environmental conditions . 
Following the visits of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to a number of the country 's rural and urban areas , during which he noted the inhabitants ' difficult living conditions , the Select Ministerial Council decided to establish a national programme to remedy the situation in districts lacking basic infrastructures . 
The Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) assisted the postal administrations of the countries concerned , mainly in modernizing their organizational structures and in improving the quality of their service to the urban and rural communities they serve .  
In addition , given the natural cycles of drought and floods in the region , weaknesses of rural and urban infrastructure , shortage of food stocks and seeds , generalized poverty , and vulnerability of the majority of the economic agents , the country will inevitably continue to face future emergency situations , at the local level or nationwide , arising from natural calamities .  
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill-treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as the girl child , children of single-parent families and those born out of wedlock , children in rural areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who , in order to survive , are living and / or working in the streets .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee recommends that special protective measures be implemented in relation to children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single-parent families , children born out of wedlock , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , children involved with the juvenile justice system , particularly when deprived of their liberty , children involved in child labour and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee also recommends that further measures be taken to gather systematic quantitative and qualitative data , disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , colour , rural / urban and social origin , on all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children , particularly the most disadvantaged groups .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements worldwide , 2 .  Endorses the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements [ 3 ] / and the Habitat Agenda [ 4 ] / adopted by the Conference on 14 June 1996 ;  
Thus , the informal sector is not a transitory activity , as assumed in the 1970s , where the urban unemployed and rural migrants obtain temporary employment before moving on to the modern sector , but has become a permanent feature and an important means of survival for a large proportion of the urban population .  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
Relevant disaggregated information ( for example , by gender , age , region , rural / urban areas and social and ethnic origin ) should be given on children having benefited from any of these measures and resources allocated to them ( at the national , regional and local levels , and where appropriate at the federal and provincial levels ) .  
To ensure appropriate prenatal and post _ natal health care for mothers , indicating the nature of services provided , including appropriate information given , the coverage ensured , the rate of mortality and its main causes ( average and disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , region , urban / rural area , social and ethnic origin ) , the proportion of pregnant women who have access to and benefit from pre _ and post _ natal health care , trained personnel and hospital care and delivery ;

Reports should also identify , inter alia , the mechanisms established and the programmes and activities developed for that purpose , as well as the education and vocational training provided , and indicate relevant disaggregated data on the children concerned , including by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , and social and ethnic origin .  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
The transfer of the productive and social infrastructure of rural human settlements , as well as their housing , to their current occupants remains a complicated undertaking that requires continued efforts from all involved parties , including the affected communities . 
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements , 
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
IFAD was already supporting countries in the early stages of implementing the Convention through the formulation of investment projects at the local level , including projects that attempted to provide an enabling environment in which farmers could help themselves , including the development of rural financial systems , demand-driven technology development , and decentralized institutions for community action .  
" Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,

The programmes contained in the appeal are aimed at establishing nationwide mechanisms that respond to immediate needs , such as basic relief , mine clearance and repatriation , and other mechanisms that respond to priority needs in deprived areas in the different regions , such as the provision of safe drinking water , primary health care , urban and rural recovery .  
Notwithstanding the modest level of funding that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) has received for activities in this sector , the total collapse of the rural infrastructure , the destruction of irrigation systems and the presence of mines in prime agricultural land , WFP has had remarkable success in assisting in the relaunching of food production .  
Today , the infrastructure in remote and rural areas can be significantly improved through satellite remote sensing , particularly with respect to natural disaster warning and mitigation , management of water , forest and food resources , planning and operation of transport systems and other supporting activities relating to social and economic development .  
" Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
" Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements worldwide ,

Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements ,  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Among other issues , the use of modern satellite telecommunications technology for supporting a range of services such as telephone , distance education and health-care services and the attendant improvement in the quality of life in remote and rural areas was demonstrated .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
The agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of both organizations in such international and regional questions as the political question of the maintenance of international peace and security or humanitarian questions such as mine clearance , as well as other questions dealing with economic and social cooperation , sustainable development , the environment , combating drugs , crime prevention , agricultural and rural development , family planning , population and health .  
The aim is to facilitate farming activities for more than 20,000 rural families , to demine energy and transport infrastructures and to destroy the 85,000 mines that are still scattered across our national territory in various locations , including around high-tension pylons , electrical substations , bridges , relay stations and areas with radio aerials along the northern and southern borders .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
The Committee is concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
Priority research5 should focus on : coastal areas where populations are growing rapidly and critical resources are being depleted at an accelerated rate , such as on highly urbanized coasts ; soil erosion and desertification , linked with inappropriate land-use practices often brought on by migration patterns ; water scarcity , and misuse and pollution of water resources in both rural and urban areas ; and deforestation resulting from inappropriate shifting cultivation patterns , fuelwood demands , and conversion of forests in upland areas to other uses , linked with demographic pressures among the poorest groups in society .  
Environmentally induced migrations are caused by natural disasters , such as earthquakes , flash flooding , typhoons , and volcanic eruptions ; by nuclear and hazardous waste contamination ; by agricultural and rural decline , resource pollution , chronic water shortages ; or by dam construction and other large-scale development projects .  
Human settlements should therefore be at the centre of concern for sustainable development , as they are essential for social and economic progress and , in an increasingly interdependent world , critical for the well-being of both urban and rural populations ( see box 1 ) .  
According to a recent UNDP publication , 5 there are , today , good opportunities in remote rural areas of developing countries for using renewable sources of energy at competitive costs to meet the small-scale mechanical or electric power needs of the individual household , farm or village .  
It is for this reason that the expert has urged the political authorities and representatives of civil society , especially the Plate-forme des organisations ha \ x { 9ba0 } iennes des droits de lhomme , to develop a sweeping programme of civic education and human rights training and to introduce legal services into rural areas .  
It has supported Palestinian women 's initiatives through an extensive network of institutions , including the work of the Women 's Center for Legal Aid and Counselling on gender sensitive amendments to legislation , the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Elections awareness-raising campaign for rural women , and the work of the Palestinian Coalition for Women 's Health . It has also encouraged activities that promote a positive representation of women in audio , visual and written media .  
Begin implementation of the rural development investment programme , paying special attention to areas where uprooted population groups are being resettled and areas where poverty is greatest , with emphasis on basic infrastructure ( main roads , rural roads , electricity , telecommunications , water and environmental sanitation ) and production projects , for a total of 300-million quetzales in 1997 .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements ,

Indian society is marked by a rigid hierarchical social stratification which divides the country into two nations : the one comprising the majority , who are poor , uneducated and illiterate , particularly in rural areas , and the other , consisting of the minority which holds the reins of power and forms the economic , social and cultural \ x { 5e68 } ite .  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
While recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the education system , the Committee is concerned about the persisting disparities in relation to the low access to education of children living in rural areas , indigenous children and refugee children , who do not enjoy a system of education adequate to their cultural values and identity .  
The Committee is also concerned at the lack of an integrated strategy on children as well as of a fully effective monitoring mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children in urban and rural areas , especially those affected by the consequences of the economic problems and by the internal conflict .  
With regard to the full implementation of the principles laid down by articles 2 , 3 , 6 and 12 in the Convention , the Committee suggests that the State party fully integrate them in all its policies , laws , actions and programmes affecting children at all levels , including on the administrative and judicial levels , especially with regard to children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups , the girl child , disabled children and children living in rural and remote areas .  
The SRRP has already funded and implemented hundreds of local initiatives which have sustainable impact in improving the access to basic social services , improving the productive potential of rural communities and establishing sustainable income-generation opportunities for rural populations .  
It serves as an expert facility and repository of technical information relating to the sustainable development of small hydropower operations as a viable and environmentally friendly alternative source of energy , particularly in rural areas of developing countries .  
While maintaining a war mentality in the vain hope of crushing the rebels in the field ( and thereby nullifying any attempt to begin the negotiations which Major Buyoya has himself advocated ) the Burundi de facto authorities are systematically resettling rural populations using an outdated strategy of forced villagization , whose weaknesses and the suffering entailed for the populations concerned have been demonstrated in other conflicts , particularly in Viet Nam . 
For rural areas not connected to grids , given the need for a transition from non-renewable to renewable energy sources , the Board recommends a sustained programme of investment in decentralized rural energy schemes , based on renewable energy , where reasonable , with the incremental cost of such schemes to be met , where necessary , from global sources , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) . 
ESCWA reports an increase in the number of projects implemented on the basis of the TCDC modality , and has cited two examples , namely , on local community development in rural areas , and on preparatory assistance for regional support to the national pursuit of sustainable human development .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
In accordance with commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit ( Rome , 13-17 November 1996 ) , 25 sustainable food security among both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
A diverse number of programmes and projects financed by the international community were implemented to support the rural reintegration process , among them programmes for basic agricultural training for almost 10,431 ex-combatants from both sides , follow-up agricultural technical assistance programmes to aid ex-combatants in the formulation of productive farming strategies , training of local agricultural technical assistance promoters and programmes providing basic shelter and , subsequently , building materials for the construction of more permanent housing .  
To ensure success , however , it is imperative to immediately provide employment opportunities and to generate incomes for the local population ; this will require focused action over a medium _ term period to relieve the population through communal and municipal local infrastructure works , food _ for _ work initiatives ( particularly for rural infrastructure development ) , integration of rural women into the local economy through training and related support for small _ scale economic activities , provision of ample micro _ and small _ scale credit at the individual and enterprise levels etc . 
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
The initiatives funded represent a wide range of strategies undertaken by national and regional groups to eliminate gender-based violence : educational campaigns , capacity-building of womens organizations , changing relevant laws , making women aware of their rights , public education on laws and rights of women pertaining to violence in rural and urban communities , action-oriented research , strengthening womens advocacy skills in work on gender-based violence , violence against women migrant workers and various training programmes targeting police , judges , teachers , health workers , and public administrators .  
Operationally , the UNIDO work programmes were based on the following thematic priorities : formulation of strategies and institution-building for global economic integration ; innovation , productivity and quality to increase competitiveness ; industrial information , investment and technology promotion ; human resource development with special attention to the integration of women in industrial development ; rural industrial development ; and industry-related environment and energy issues .  
The combination of those four cardinal rules of development at the local level defined the approach of IFAD , based on precise actions to reduce rural poverty and promote a process of equitable and broad-based agricultural and rural development .  
The motor of that process was the promotion of an enabling environment that would ensure increased access for the poor to economic services and industrial goods , given that the great majority of poor people in rural areas were self-employed and that their prosperity depended on their having direct access to more and improved means of production .  
Recognizing , however , the importance of agricultural development no only for people living in rural areas but as an engine of growth , the Bank had formulated during the past year a new action plan for rural development , designed to address current problems and to provide a new and dynamic framework for future Bank activities in that area .  The plan had just been presented to the Bank 's Board of Directors .  
At the international level , the action plan defined a specific set of complementary actions designed to re-establish the necessary priority for improving agriculture and the rural economy , including two high-profile initiatives .  
The international community has recognized the need for an integrated approach to the protection and sustainable management of land and soil resources , as stated in decision III / 11 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity , [ 34 ] including identification of land degradation , which involves all interested parties at the local as well as the national level , including farmers , small-scale food producers , indigenous people ( s ) , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , women , who have a vital role in rural communities .  
In accordance with the commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit , [ 35 ] sustainable food security for both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , the income-generating potential of rural women by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
At the World Conference on Education for All and the World Summit for Social Development , Governments committed themselves to ensuring universal access to quality education , attaining the highest possible standards of physical and mental health and ensuring access of all to primary health care .  This should include efforts to rectify inequalities relating to social conditions , race , national origin , age or disability , and between urban and rural areas .  
As stated in earlier paragraphs , the Ministry of Culture and Education is taking steps under the Social Plan for Education on behalf of low _ income and rural sectors , indigenous communities , children with physical or mental disabilities and specific population groups with a view to ensuring that they may enter and stay in the educational system and strengthening the teaching function of schools by giving priority to strategies to improve in-house training and help eliminate educational inequalities .  
This is fully in line with the predominant role of the agricultural sector in African economies , the potential for long-term comparative advantage of agro-based production , the multiple linkages between the industrial and agricultural sectors and their potential socioeconomic / economic impact through SMEs and informal-sector activities , particularly in rural areas .  
Furthermore , it recognized the existence of systematic and technological causes of environmental degradation in rural areas of the LDCs , and supported institutional and social programmes for sustainable development in those countries .  
Despite the collapse of rural infrastructure , the destruction of irrigation systems and the presence of mines in prime agricultural land , a number of projects are being implemented to support an increase in overall food production among settled farming communities , nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists , returnees and vulnerable groups .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide the poor populations in urban and rural areas , especially women , with the capabilities needed to increase their profit from participation in the market , thus improving their standards of living and raising their share of contribution to the gross domestic products of their countries .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
The Team has directly raised awareness about Pacific island Constitutions , laws , human rights , gender and the application of United Nations Conventions among rural and urban women , youth groups , civil society activists , social welfare officers , police officers , religious seminarians , magistrates , justices , senior court judges and other providers of the justice system in the Cook Islands , Fiji , the Federated States of Micronesia , Kiribati , the Marshall Islands , Nauru , Niue , Samoa , the Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu and Vanuatu .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
In rural settings , where women have little access to resources to pay for transport and where roads are likely to be poor and vehicles rare , the physical barriers involved render the use even of routine prenatal care services complicated and use of services for complications and emergencies is difficult .  
In addition to the national and local levels traditionally considered , attention needs to be given to the subnational level where new approaches to participatory democracy are emerging , for example in growing cities and their rural hinterland , in river basins or groupings of neighbourhoods in mega-cities .  
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights with men and access to economic resources and to increase the access of women to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
The Commission , which at its thirty-fifth session considered the question of employment and sustainable livelihoods , reached certain agreed conclusions that have as their goal productive employment ; decreasing unemployment through improved social services , such as education and health care ; giving loans to the private sector in both urban and rural areas ; and improving information and guidance services .  
It focuses on strengthening the institutional capacities of the Government at both central and local levels , policy management and poverty monitoring , promoting human resources development through providing better access to health and education opportunities , alleviating rural poverty , good governance and developing and strengthening the basic social safety net .  
Countries in which rural poverty and large urban rural disparities are driving rapid urbanization should build rural infrastructure , decentralize social services and decision-making to rural local authorities , encourage rural enterprises through expansion of rural credit and technical assistance , and promote agricultural productivity .  
When resources of the central government are insufficient to meet the needs for public services and infrastructure , local authorities and non-governmental organizations can play an important role in raising resources , providing services , strengthening rural / urban linkages , stimulating private investment , and implementing national policies .  
The health component of such plans should address the key objectives spelled out in chapter 6 of Agenda 21 , namely ( a ) meeting primary health care needs , particularly in rural areas , ( b ) control of communicable diseases , ( c ) protecting vulnerable groups , ( d ) meeting the urban health challenge and ( e ) reducing health risks from environmental pollution and hazards .  
This youth policy is coordinated on an inter-ministerial basis and involves two major non-governmental organizations : the National Union of Syrian Students ( with a membership composed of students in universities , postgraduate studies and higher and intermediate institutes ) and the Revolutionary Youth Union ( with a membership of over 1.5-million composed of young workers , rural youth , students with both political and non-political backgrounds , including social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic and artistic . 
In addition , China has developed rewarding systems for young people such as the Ten Top Chinese Young People , prominent young entrepreneurs , prominent young township entrepreneurs , young technical pace-setters , young skilful workers at their posts , rural young shooting star guides , the Chinese young scientist prize and Chinese youth science and technology pioneering prizes .  
Beginning in October 1996 , the Act has been the subject of an energetic explanatory and awareness _ raising campaign directed at all sectors of the Rwandan population : the administration and the public , urban and rural sectors , judicial and prison personnel and detainees .  
There is a growing need to integrate urban needs with those of the surrounding rural , or once rural areas ; to assess changes in the peri-urban areas in response to rapid urbanization ; to prepare strategies to meet the concentrated demands for food , energy and various material goods ; to ensure that urban development proceeds in an environmentally sound manner ; and to involve all stakeholders in urban development projects .  
Since rural energy problems persist and energy is not playing its full role as a motor for rural development , the following issues have emerged as complementary priorities or as new areas of focus : ( a ) more emphasis on the micro or household level ; ( b ) renewed interest in eco-village projects , solar villages etc . ; ( c ) promotion of innovative financial schemes to promote small businesses ; and ( d ) emphasis on the impact of rural energy on agricultural productivity .

Of particular concern are certain vulnerable groups of children , including children with disabilities , particularly mental disabilities , girls , particularly Vidomegons , children living in remote rural areas , children living in extreme poverty , children living and / or working on the street , refugee and asylum _ seeking children , children in the juvenile justice system , children born out of wedlock , children of incestuous relations , and institutionalized children .  
Concern is expressed at the lack of a systematic , comprehensive and disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data _ collection mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention , especially the most sensitive , such as child abuse or ill _ treatment , but also in relation to all vulnerable groups of children , especially girls , children with disabilities , children living in rural areas , children living in poverty and refugee children .  
With regard to the implementation of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 36 , para . 15 ) about the persistent regional disparities between the Atlantic and Central / Pacific regions , the growing disparities between urban and rural areas as well as the increasing number of people living in urban poor and marginalized areas .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party to reduce economic , social and regional disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .

This role may be characterized in very broad terms as ( a ) meeting the rapidly growing demand for energy services in the industrial , transport , commercial , agricultural and household sectors ; ( b ) servicing developing countries rural energy requirements with modern energy carriers ; and ( c ) dealing with environmental problems at various levels .  
Following the World Solar Summit , held at Harare in September 1996 , organized under the guidance of the World Solar Commission , a 10-year programme aimed at the wider use of all sources of environmentally sound , renewable energies , as well as at improving the quality of life , notably in the rural areas of developing countries , was prepared and subsequently approved by the World Solar Commission in June 1997 .  
Such activities are intended to promote energy efficiency and demand-side management ; clean energy technologies ; more widespread development and application of renewable energy technologies ; improved access to modern energy services by rural populations ; capacity-building and institutional development ; energy sector planning and management to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of sustainable development ; and the promotion of environmentally sound energy technologies .  
Meetings : two are planned for 2000 , with the leadership or close collaboration of the United Nations programme on ageing an expert examination of the interaction of social technologies and multigenerational ties ( supported by the Government of the United Kingdom and being organized by HelpAge International ) ; and an international conference on rural ageing ( being organized by the University of West Virginia ) .

Across the region , there are indications of a growing gap in human development between zones of relative affluence in the capitals and principal cities and the extreme poverty of marginalized rural and urban areas .  There are related patterns of social inequality and exclusion between social groups , reflected in regional data on distribution of income and access to employment , health and education .  
He notes that low levels of disbursement , especially at the local level , continue to erode the already modest share of the national budget allocated to the health sector , and draws attention to the fact that the gap between the budget allocated and actual expenditure is highest for the operating expenses of rural health services , crucial for the well-being of the population .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damage sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
Commodities continue to provide an important economic starting base : they have a high value-added component ; agricultural commodities are an important source of employment and offer scope for anti-poverty campaigns ; and agriculture frequently acts as a buffer against economic problems and allows the return to rural areas of urban unemployed , as in the current crisis .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Statistics showed that female-headed households constituted 47 per cent of the rural and 29 per cent of the urban population living below the poverty line , and that women represented a disproportionate share of the agricultural labour force , but controlled only 38 per cent of its operations . 
The objectives were to achieve nutritional coverage of the most vulnerable sector , reduce maternal and infant mortality , and ensure the supply of clean drinking water ; eliminate female illiteracy in rural areas and provide vocational training in urban areas , and educate women about their rights ; and reduce poverty , provide small loans to womens rural cooperatives , and increase employment .

Recognizing the need for continuing international assistance for the maintenance abroad and the voluntary repatriation and resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons , and welcoming the voluntary return of refugees to rural districts in Afghanistan that are relatively stable and secure ,  
A key question for UNCTAD to consider is : can the barriers to international trade in agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough to enable a poverty reduction strategy for the rural developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm employment rather than on a heavy reliance on social programmes and social safety net ?  
Their joint negative impact on agricultural growth rates in the developing world is a major reason for the slow progress in rural development , and for rural poverty reduction over the last half century .  
Can the barriers to international trade for agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough for a poverty reduction strategy for rural areas of the developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm activities rather than on social programmes and safety nets ?  
The primary components of the draft sustainable energy and climate change strategy include : promoting strategic innovations in the delivery of sustainable energy services in rural areas of developing countries ; increasing the use of market-based policies to achieve climate change objectives ; and encouraging the participation of developing countries in climate change negotiations by promoting their capacity to identify , negotiate and implement key issues .

For rural areas not connected to grids , sustained programmes of investment in decentralized rural energy schemes , based on an efficient use of renewable energy sources , where reasonable , should be launched , with the incremental cost of such schemes to be met , where necessary from regional and global sources , to meet local demands for energy services .  
Of the estimated 3.1-billion people in rural areas , approximately 2-billion have no access to electricity and about the same number of people rely on traditional energy sources for cooking , such as wood , charcoal and animal and plant wastes , which are associated with adverse environmental effects at the local level .  
Policies for rural development and rural energy policies should be developed and implemented in a mutually reinforcing way and appropriate government agencies within the responsible ministry for national energy policy should be assigned specific duty for rural energy , in some cases at the local or provincial levels .  
The positive engagement with the natural resource base is essential not only to maintain local and national food security but also to offer opportunities for balanced rural development .

However , the efforts to spread basic education in rural areas are hampered by a number of constraints of a geographical , economic and cultural nature ( absence of means of communication , scattered habitations , mountainous areas in certain regions , etc . ) .  
In implementation of high royal instructions placing rural areas at the heart of governmental strategy , in the framework of the policy enabling all citizens to participate in cultural life and to contribute to the improvement of rural living conditions , and with a view to improving the geographical distribution of cultural services and facilities , the Ministry of Culture has initiated , in cooperation with local communities , an extensive programme to build and equip libraries in rural centres .  
In the framework of the decentralization and democratisation of cultural life , having regard to the role of culture in all economic and social development , and in order to enable rural areas to enjoy appropriate cultural facilities in accordance with law 47-96 on regional organization , permanent committees responsible for educational and cultural matters have been established as part of the sixteen recently created regional councils .  
It was reasonable to expect that , in the foreseeable future , most of the pertinent telecommunication activities and services in developing countries would develop and revolve around those thrust areas , which had been identified as follows : ( a ) distance education ; ( b ) mobile personal communications ; ( c ) direct-to-home television and radio broadcasting ; ( d ) telemedicine ; ( e ) rural telecommunications ; and ( f ) Internet services .  
For small loads typical of rural households in remote areas with sufficient insolation , solar PV systems are proving to be economically and technically successful , when complemented by an institutional approach , including financial arrangements , that provides for the installation of the systems and maintenance on a fee-for-service basis .  
It includes purchase of one digital satellite ( hot standby ) terminal , one Optaphone digitally controlled rural telephone link system , four global positioning systems and the replacement of 30 base mobile transceivers .  
Thus , since 1995 , INDAP has explicitly mainstreamed a gender perspective in its regular institutional activities , meaning that a cross-cutting approach will be taken to each of its activities and measures , based on the recognition of rural families as a basic unit of the production process , with different requirements according to their composition and specific members ( men , women , young people , older persons , relatives , etc . ) .  
In 1995 , a Rural Division was created within the National Office for Womens Affairs to ensure that the Ministry of Agriculture and its affiliated offices , decentralized agencies and other public and private entities associated with rural womens issues incorporate measures and actions guaranteeing equal opportunity for rural women into their planning and regular activities .  
In fiscal 1998 the Bank allocated to the social sector US $ 8 , 480-million out of total lending of US $ 28 , 594-million , including US $ 1.9-billion for health , population and nutrition ; US $ 665 million for basic infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation facilities ; and US $ 3.1-billion for education , placing greater emphasis on primary education for girls , the rural poor and linguistic minorities .  
Among the main concerns in the region are unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of those natural resources on which rural communities depend ; optimized use of land ; living conditions of coastal people ; insufficiently treated urban wastes , oil pollution and coastal erosion .  
The official United Nations demographic estimates and projections will be prepared for all countries and areas of the world , as well as urban and rural areas and major cities , and will serve as the standard and consistent set of population figures for use throughout the United Nations system . 
The review , with an explicit gender perspective , of existing legislative and administrative frameworks in the context of urban policy reforms , will be required to support the partnership process towards the provision of land , shelter , infrastructure and services at the level of poor urban and rural settlements .

Investing and strengthening efforts to meet the basic needs of rural women through capacity-building and human resources development measures and the provision of a safe and reliable water supply , health services , including family planning services , and nutritional programmes as well as education and literacy programmes and social support measures ;  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
The disease affects everyone poor , rich ; urban , rural ; employee , employer , unemployed ; educated , ignorant ; married , single ; young , old ; resident , tourist .  
Obstacles : Benefits of the growing global economy have been unevenly distributed , creating wider economic disparities , unsafe working environments and persistent gender inequality in the informal economy and rural sector .  
Since those elected bodies were instruments of local cell governments , responsible for plans for economic development and social justice , rural women could now play a leading role in shaping the destiny of their community .  
Strategic options being considered include fostering human capital development and the creation of permanent rural jobs through public investments geared to conserving and restoring natural resources ;  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that nongovernmental and communitybased organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grassroots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Governments need to develop a suitable legal and institutional environment to facilitate active partnerships with the private sector in a manner that ensures the provision of services to the urban and rural poor .  
The relevant indicators used to assess such an adequate standard of living , and its incidence among the child population , including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , social and ethnic origin , and family situation ;  
To make such forms available and accessible to every child , providing inter alia any relevant disaggregated data including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , national , social and ethnic origin , coverage and budgetary allocation ;

The representative informed the Committee that women in her country faced sociocultural and economic discrimination , particularly in the rural areas where 84.6 per cent of the population lived and where deeplyrooted traditions and customs shaped daily life . 
Striving to meet basic needs but unable to increase their productivity , poor rural households in most lowincome countries have been forced to expand onto marginal lands and / or mine their existing land base through unsustainable landmanagement practices .  
The objective is to achieve adequate shelter and access to basic services for all , especially the deprived urban and rural poor , through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter and services .  
Enabling policies and programmes at the national and local level are to be implemented that assist the efforts of the private and nongovernmental sectors , and the selfhelp efforts of poor residents in urban and rural areas , to improve shelter conditions .  
The minimum standard of living is established on the basis of baskets of indispensable things such as food , clothing , lodging and items of hygiene , calculated according to the population segments in urban and rural areas .  
The position of women is traditionally weak and subordinate in Nepalese society , rendering the CPN programmes , with their strong emphasis on equality , attractive , both among the growing cadre of educated women and those of the disadvantaged in rural areas .  
But over and above traditional legal aid , which is generally limited to criminal matters , the expert emphasized the need to help rural people to use common law as an instrument to improve their rights situation .  
FAO designed a regional project on increasing rural womens food productivity through improved agricultural technology transfer and adoption in Africa , involving relevant United Nations agencies and selected countries in the region .  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that nongovernmental and communitybased organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grassroots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that nongovernmental and communitybased organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grassroots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
In mid1999 , fewer than 30 per cent of urban dwellers had a regular service , there were no operational systems in rural areas and the quality of water posed a threat to public health .  
Urges United Nations organizations , the international community and non-governmental organizations to continue their efforts aimed at the enhanced ownership and participation of the eastern Timorese , known as Timorization , in East Timor , in the social , economic and administrative infrastructure and , in this regard , stresses the need for capacity-building , inter alia , in such areas as education , health , agriculture and rural development , the judiciary , governance and public administration , security and law and order ; .  
The Beijing Platform for Action notes that lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health ( para . 
[ 16 ] Alongside the absence of a commitment to making primary education free , and uncertainties as to which children will be classified as poor ( or ultra-poor ) to merit bursaries , this model also raises concerns about the administrative costs of collecting school fees ( necessarily minuscule in poor rural Zambia ) and administrating the bursaries ( also minuscule ) . 
Female genital mutilation had been banned in many African countries ; policy-makers and healthcare providers in many countries were paying more attention to adolescent reproductive health ; access to health services was being improved for poor rural women and efforts were being made to address the particular vulnerability of women and girl children to the HIV / AIDS epidemic .  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of non-discrimination is not fully implemented for non-citizen children , children belonging to minorities , including Roma children , poor or dysfunctional families , children with disabilities and children living in rural areas , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
In light of its previous concluding observations and taking note of efforts by the State party to combat poverty and its negative effects on children , the Committee remains concerned at the large disparities in the enjoyment of economic and social rights , particularly health and education , by children living in rural areas and regions lagging behind in socio-economic development .  
The Committee is also concerned that the State party has not taken measures to address discrimination against children who are born out of wedlock , those affected by HIV / AIDS , children in remote rural areas , children born of incestuous relationships , institutionalized children , pregnant girls , children with disabilities , street children and children of ethnic minority groups .  
The Committee notes with concern the poor health situation of children in the State party and in particular the limited access to basic health care for children ( especially in rural and mountainous areas ) , high maternal , child and infant mortality rates , low and decreasing immunization levels , high rates of malnutrition , poor sanitation and limited access to safe drinking water , especially in rural communities .  
The Committee welcomes the State partys efforts in the field of education , in particular the inclusion of human rights teaching , including childrens rights , in the school curricula , but it remains concerned about the high drop-out and repetition rates in primary and secondary schools , disparities between urban and rural areas in terms of access to education and to quality education , the insufficient number of well-trained teaching staff and childrens limited access to materials and text books .  
Reaffirming that alternative development as a process to prevent and eliminate the illicit cultivation of plants containing narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances by adopting rural development measures that are specifically designed for that purpose and that are carried out in the context of sustained national economic growth and sustainable development efforts in countries taking action against drugs , recognizing the particular socio-cultural characteristics of the target communities and groups , within the framework of a comprehensive and permanent solution to the problem of illicit drugs ,  
Within that global objective , the Commission would concentrate on six areas of comparative advantage : trade and development ; regional integration and cooperation ; macro-economic policies linked with poverty reduction strategies , in particular the strengthening of social sectors such as health and education ; reliable and sustainable transport ; food security and sustainable rural development strategies ; and institutional capacity-building , good governance and the rule of law .  
Although a few women have achieved high social status in modern political , economic or professional life , the situation of the average woman , especially in rural areas , remains dire .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
The programme of work under this section has been elaborated within the framework of programme 15 of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 ( A / 55 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , which identifies three major themes : ( a ) promoting regional economic cooperation ; ( b ) alleviating poverty in rural and urban areas ; and ( c ) protecting the environment , improving the management of natural resources and focusing on the development of infrastructure and information systems .  
Mindful of the fact that the Asian and Pacific region has two thirds of the worlds population living under the absolute poverty level and the imperative of integrating environmental considerations into economic and social development , the programme will highlight a stronger poverty alleviation thrust , particularly in the areas of social development , population and rural and urban development , and environmental and natural resources management .  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
The suffering of large numbers of children especially infants and nursing mothers from lack of primary health care , basic health services and malnutrition or unbalanced diets , lack of clean drinking water and proper sanitation , especially in rural and desert areas , poor districts and refugee camps , increased hazards of environmental pollution , dangers of the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and lack of care provided to children with special needs ;  
The Commission also encouraged Governments to take into consideration the health and safety concerns of women and children in rural energy programmes , and to promote efforts to address the disproportionate burdens experienced by women in rural areas in access to energy supply .  Governments were encouraged to improve policies that reduce environmental health hazards , including through plans and strategies to prevent , mitigate and respond to diseases resulting from indoor and outdoor air pollution , giving special attention to the health of women and children .  
However , persistent political tension along Guineas southern borders and the resultant prolonged presence of refugees , especially in the rural areas , have been putting tremendous pressure on its natural resources .  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
This implies an increased focus on issues like good governance at national and international levels and the fight against corruption , respect for all internationally recognized human rights , gender issues , capacity and institutional building , social services supply and environmental concerns .  The majority of the poor live in rural areas .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
While we strive our best to mobilize domestic resources and to learn from best practices , the global community must help us with increased flows of official development assistance , better trading opportunities , expanded debt relief and support for institutional development so that our people , living in urban and rural areas alike , can lead a decent and productive life .  
Accessibility to reliable and affordable energy was very unevenly distributed , both between countries and within countries , and many developing countries faced an urgent need to provide adequate , reliable and affordable energy services to millions of people in rural areas .

The fourth edition of the World Banks Poverty Trends and Voices of the Poor , 2001 reports on recent progress in poverty reduction for selected countries on the basis of data derived primarily from surveys using national poverty lines , not the $ 1 a day poverty line . 1 In East Asia , the sharp decline in poverty in China during the 1990s was accompanied by widening income inequality between the countrys more rural western provinces and the more industrialized east , which probably slowed the overall rate of poverty reduction for the country . 
In its resolution 54 / 135 of 17 December 1999 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General , in cooperation with the relevant international organizations , specialized agencies , funds and programmes , and in consultation with Member States , to prepare a comprehensive report on the situation of rural women and challenges faced by them , based , inter alia , on the outcome of an expert group meeting , which would draw from the contributions and case studies provided by experts from various regions and to submit it to the Assembly at its fifty-sixth session .  
In the process of rural industrialization , independent entrepreneurs cater for local and international markets and act as subcontractors to larger domestic and foreign firms , thus further intensifying market integration .  
A renewed commercial interest in biodiversity and indigenous plants and materials has created opportunities for rural women to utilize their traditional knowledge and experience and to take advantage of emerging national and global markets .  
With increased demand for cheap female labour and aggressive job advertising on the part of prospective employers , rural women who are relatively isolated from the outside world can be faced with the risks of trafficking and HIV / AIDS .  
In addition , it is important to create an enabling policy environment for improving the situation of rural women , which would include the design and implementation of a gender-sensitive macroeconomic policy framework and social support systems which would accommodate womens productive and reproductive roles and encourage a more equal gender division of labour in the household . 
Training programmes and discussions aimed at both rural women and men to promote gender awareness should be organized by national and local governments , human rights groups and other non-governmental organizations in order to encourage the sharing of parental roles and domestic duties by men .  
Governments , donors , non-governmental organizations and the private sector should develop specific assistance programmes and advisory services for the development of the economic skills of rural women in banking , modern trading and financial procedures , matching the requirements of the market economy .  
The indigenous knowledge of rural women and their experience in subsistence production and environmental management should be recognized by national and local governments and development experts as a resource , and should be integrated into formal programmes .  
Those factors included : continued high dependence on food imports ; a direct linkage between rural agricultural viability and poverty reduction ; difficulties in balancing the short-term benefits of food aid and its long-term impact ; severe adjustment costs arising from unilateral liberalization of the agricultural sector ; non-competitiveness of agricultural exports in the world market ; and high dependence of foreign exchange earnings on exports of one or two agricultural commodity under preferential market access .  
He also agreed with the call for the establishment of concrete provisions relating to special and differential treatment and to provide developing countries with technical assistance to allow them to meet their legitimate needs , such as rural development and food security .  
Such projects have included peoples sensitization campaigns on indigenous people issues in Chile ; training sessions for school teachers and representatives of social groups in Chile ; the establishment of a centre in Mexico where human rights violations can be reported and which provides legal assistance to vulnerable groups , such as rural populations , street children , prisoners and people living with HIV / AIDS . France Liberts has also been advocating against the death penalty ; a CD-ROM against racism was also produced and distributed among schools and for public awareness purposes . 
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
The studies point out that development of a coherent rural , national and international transport network is essential for stimulating economic activity , opening up productive areas in individual countries and linking them to national , regional and international markets .  
Noting that FAO viewed the HIV / AIDS pandemic not just as a health issue but as a problem of critical importance for development in general , she said that her organization was prompted by increasing evidence that HIV / AIDS intensified existing labour bottlenecks in agriculture , worsened the problem of malnutrition and further complicated the problems of rural women . 
Invites Member States , in collaboration with the United Nations organizations and civil society , to place a renewed focus on the issue of improving the situation of rural women in implementing at both national and international levels the Beijing Declaration2 and Platform for Action3 and the outcome document6 adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-third special session , taking into account also the conclusions and recommendations of the United Nations expert group meeting on the situation of rural women within the context of globalization , held in 2001 , by , inter alia :  
The issue of sustainable development should be addressed , since increased burning of firewood by the rural population , which lacks access to modern commercial energy , leads to environmental problems .  
The overall goal of the country programme is the realization of the rights of all children and women in rural and urban communities through the reduction of infant and under-five mortality rates ; the reduction of the maternal mortality ratio ; the reduction of severe and moderate malnutrition ; universal access to safe drinking water ; increased access to sanitation ; universal access to primary education ; and the elimination of child labour .

Underlines with concern that key commitments remain outstanding in the areas of fiscal , judicial , military , electoral and land reform , as well as decentralization and rural development , and therefore urges that those commitments be implemented without further delay ;  
While the Johannesburg agenda was challenging and daunting , it offered a real chance to demonstrate the power of collaboration and to work for the common good , provided that all relevant actors in the United Nations system , Governments , businesses , urban and rural communities , rich and poor countries joined forces to overcome humanitys tremendous challenges and chose the path of sustainable development .  
Develop and utilize indigenous energy sources and infrastructures for various local uses and promote rural community participation , including local Agenda 21 groups , with the support of the international community , in developing and utilizing renewable energy technologies to meet their daily energy needs to find simple and local solutions ;  
Promoting at the regional level rural electrification projects , including renewable energy technologies , and supporting local efforts to provide energy supplies to their basic infrastructures as well as integrating energy policies into overall rural development strategies , with emphasis on income generation , taking into account national circumstances ;
