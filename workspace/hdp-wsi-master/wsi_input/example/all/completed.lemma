After Kuan had completed a substantial number of egg carvings , their durability began to be a concern among those who had collected them . But Kuan is not worried that his art is invariably transitory . He gives the example of the 100-year-old Russian " Faberge egg " that the Tsar gave as a present to the King of England and which still remains very much intact in Buckingham Palace . " The crucial point in storing egg carvings is simply whether or not they are well protected , " he said .  
In early August , during Typhoon Morakot , I left Tainan Airport and sped along the freeway . A few days earlier , a viaduct was completed and opened to traffic , cutting down the travel time between the airport and the park .

As motor-scooter riders themselves , they started from their own experience of often being dazzled by the high beams of car headlights that prevent one from seeing the road ahead clearly . The team had the idea of installing a warning device to remind drivers behind to dip their lights . They combined it with a reversing alert to give a warning if the vehicle ahead backs up , and a turn signal canceling device to automatically switch off the indicator after the scooter has completed a turn and is going straight ahead again .  
This falls a long way short of the target of 1.5 million households , but is a good start nevertheless .

However , the modest initial steps to establish the register in 1991 were then recognized and accepted as a practical necessity since the evolutionary nature of this mechanism was abundantly clear from General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L . It was also clear at that time that there was a prescribed time-frame for ensuring the applicability of this evolution to be completed during the 1994 session of the Group of Governmental Experts which was mandated to undertake this task .

Meanwhile , the main regulations governing Taiwan 's relations with Hong Kong have been largely completed . July 1997 will not merely be a starting point for Tung and the people of Hong Kong . Taiwanese , mainland Chinese , overseas Chinese , and Asia-watchers everywhere are waiting with bated breath . Tung is indeed bearing an unprecedented historical burden .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
Moreover , Islam 's greatest emotional power is in the Qur'an . " It clears the mind and teaches the true way , " he says . The faithful believe that the Qur'an is a record of what the Prophet Mohammed received from Allah . Mohammed was illiterate ; the Qur'an was compiled by his successors based on what Mohammed told them , and completed after his death , in the seventh century CE .  
When we come to the Mennonite Christian Hospital in early December , a huge Christmas tree stands in the middle of the foyer of the newly completed hospital building . At the registration counter , in the consulting rooms , at the payment counter , at the pharmacy and even in the staff offices , everywhere is festooned with colored streamers , snowflakes and fairy lights . Instead of the cold , depressing atmosphere usually associated with hospitals , the place is full of the warm and festive spirit of Christmas .  
With improved technology , doctors rely increasingly on machines , and are unwilling to make any judgments before tests are completed . One book called Why Things Bite Back tells the true story of a Stanford University medical student who had a stomach ailment for four weeks . He entered the university hospital , and underwent a series of painful tests , and was told that the problem was with his appendix . But a retired old doctor only had to hear his descriptions of his symptoms , and that veteran physician knew immediately what the problem was .  
Dusk is falling , and having completed a hard day 's work , everyone is relaxing in front of the television in their warm homes , when scenes of hurricane-devastated neighbourhoods appear on the screen . " These are our friends , " intones the familiar voice of Jason Hu , Minister of Foreign Affairs . In what turns out to be the voice-over of an advertisement , he appeals for a helping hand to be extended to long-term friends of the ROC ravaged by Hurricane Mitch .  
From 1957 on , the central government appointed three consecutive governors with military backgrounds . Behind this pattern was a tense military standoff with mainland China , which shelled the island of Kinmen heavily in 1958 . A number of projects designed to promote political stability and ensure economic and social survival and development were completed during these years .  
The lower end of the neck on each of the heads ends in a pointed diamond shape , suggesting that the heads were all mounted on bodies made of some other material , and that they were arranged in solemn majesty around an altar , with the big bronze statue standing in the center . After the sacred rite was completed , the beautifully crafted statues and ceremonial implements were burnt , broken , and placed in the pit . Why would anyone have done this ?  
When Phase 2 of the project is completed ( expected to be in 2003 ) , the water will have risen by 135 meters . When the total project is finished ( est . 2009 ) , the water will be 175 meters-roughly equivalent to a 50-story building-above its original level . The resulting reservoir will be 300 kilometers across and the catchment area will cover 19 cities and counties including 300 smaller townships .  
The day she completed apprenticeship , the shaman prepared chicken and pork as offerings to previous shamans in the line . Thereafter , he gave Labay a piece of rolled-up sticky rice through a bamboo divination tube .

Misery and suffering left in the wake of the 21 September Chichi earthquake are still apparent over a wide area , but rebuilding continues non-stop , and appraisal of damage to buildings in the disaster areas has been completed . The government has been busy distributing financial help and contributions sent by sympathetic onlookers , and temporary housing for 4,500 families will be completed by the middle of November . These are just the first steps in post-disaster relief efforts however ; full-scale recovery still has a long way to go .  
Huang Ming-chuan , who studied law before he began making movies , has come to be seen as the standard-bearer for independent films in Taiwan .

Legal restraint involves legislation and enforcement . We must first undertake the appropriate legislative tasks , and amend laws governing political contributions , lobbying , political parties , compulsory trusts , and election rules . Once completed , the laws can only be effective if they are strictly enforced . Thus law-enforcement agencies must be able to thoroughly enforce laws in order to prevent financial interests and political interests from working together behind the scenes for illicit ends .  
This completed the stage of " revolutionary government " and marked the beginning of the stage of " tutelary government . " In this period , which was supposed to prepare the country for future constitutional government , the KMT was in full control , and such terms as parliament , elections , and political parties disappeared from view .  
On 24 March the Council of Grand Justices , which had been asked to examine the constitutionality of the assembly 's extension of its own term of office , ruled that the measure was invalid . Central Election Commission acting chairman Huang Shih-cheng has stated that if the Grand Justices ' ruling is confirmed , elections to the National Assembly will be held immediately , and can be expected to be completed before the assembly 's original mandate expires on 20 May .

The 23-kilometer-long old Mountain Line was built in 1908 , early in the Japanese colonial era . Trains on this line began by winding through the precipices of Sanyi Rural Township , and from there cut through mountains and crossed rivers . This was the last north-south line in western Taiwan to be completed , and the most difficult stretch of track from an engineering point of view , with nine tunnels and three bridges .  
With the public in an uproar and politicians scrambling to distance themselves from corruption , the Legislative Yuan 's Home and Nations Committee completed its initial review of the political contributions law , and the ruling and opposition parties were expecting to get the bill through the third and final reading during the recently concluded legislative session .

Chronologically speaking , each segment in the process was tightly linked . A MOE-certified candidate who completed teacher training in the summer of 1999 would then have to move on to the next phase of earning education credits at an academic institution by September ; 40 credits later , the prospective instructor would then have to locate an elementary school at which to complete the one year internship . Only strict adherence to this schedule would lead to a complete MOE endorsement - - a teacher 's certificate - - by September , 2001 .  
One can not but note a sharp contrast between Chen 's life story and the legends that abound in martial arts novels . In the novels , a martial artist typically enters the mountains in search of a master and encounters an immortal sage who gives him a sword that makes him the best swordsman in the land . Chen 's rise to the top of his craft has hardly been so meteoric . His swords are completed slowly , at the cost of tremendous sweat .  
Of all the famous artifacts it was the carved ivory balls in particular that captured his interest . The superb craftsmanship expressed in their warm rich hues and intricately carved multiple layers never ceased to amaze him . Seeing these ivory balls he too was determined to carve ivory once he had completed his obligatory military service .  
After Kuan had completed a substantial number of egg carvings , their durability began to be a concern among those who had collected them . But Kuan is not worried that his art is invariably transitory . He gives the example of the 100-year-old Russian " Faberge egg " that the Tsar gave as a present to the King of England and which still remains very much intact in Buckingham Palace . " The crucial point in storing egg carvings is simply whether or not they are well protected , " he said .  
In early August , during Typhoon Morakot , I left Tainan Airport and sped along the freeway . A few days earlier , a viaduct was completed and opened to traffic , cutting down the travel time between the airport and the park . After just under a half-hour , I arrived at a point in between the three townships of Hsinshi , Shanhwa , and Anting . Then , all of a sudden the storm cleared , and a tremendous vista spread out before me .  
The Japanese , well acquainted with the curative effects of hot springs , were pleasantly surprised to discover Peitou 's hot springs whilst hunting down anti-Japanese rebels and collecting sulfur . In a short time , a hostel offering bathing pools for army use was built on the site , along with the Taipei Garrison Hospital , Recuperation Branch-both were completed with the same speed and quality of construction used in the other areas of Taipei and Peitou .  
As motor-scooter riders themselves , they started from their own experience of often being dazzled by the high beams of car headlights that prevent one from seeing the road ahead clearly . The team had the idea of installing a warning device to remind drivers behind to dip their lights . They combined it with a reversing alert to give a warning if the vehicle ahead backs up , and a turn signal canceling device to automatically switch off the indicator after the scooter has completed a turn and is going straight ahead again .  
This falls a long way short of the target of 1.5 million households , but is a good start nevertheless . By contrast , at present only around 40-50 larger sets of photovoltaic panels are installed in Taiwan to generate electricity from the sun 's rays . On public land and buildings , to date the MOEA has completed demonstration systems in only a few locations including the Presidential Palace and the Yushan meteorological observatory . There is also little sign of enthusiasm for installations on ordinary residential buildings .  
Nita Ing says that construction on the high-speed rail project is 60% complete . This includes the civil engineering work , which is 100% complete .

In 2000 , the Yushan Weather Station expansion project was finally completed , with the original 100-square-meter wooden hut expanded into a 160-square-meter steel frame structure with a sheet-metal roof . At the same time , new equipment , such as a live video feed system , was added . The number of photovoltaic panels and power storage batteries was also increased , as a result of which the power supply was improved .  
After the workshop concluded , the members went on to form the Wenshan Neovista Association , launching a series of talks , fighting for funding , planning the renovation effort , getting the opinions of local residents , and construction companies involved in the effort .

Soon after completion the college opened the hall with a series of art and literature activities , using it to pass on the area 's rich art and culture .  
A : The cross-strait industrial relationship has been complementary for the past 20 years , but now economic development in the mainland is gradually bringing us into competition with one another .

However , the modest initial steps to establish the register in 1991 were then recognized and accepted as a practical necessity since the evolutionary nature of this mechanism was abundantly clear from General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L . It was also clear at that time that there was a prescribed time-frame for ensuring the applicability of this evolution to be completed during the 1994 session of the Group of Governmental Experts which was mandated to undertake this task .
