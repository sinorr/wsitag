A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
Wu Kuang-ting , for many years secretary of overseas Chinese affairs at the ROC embassy , explains : " There are three such chief justices in Panama , each nominated by the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government respectively .

The main difference between the two blueprints is that Kaohsiung City Government , which is the landlord and is carrying out the initial sea reclamation work , hopes to find a new face for the city in the new land , and is wary of letting it fall into the hands of outsiders . The Ministry of Communications , however , which operates the international port at the same location and is responsible for overall future on-site development , emphasizes the national interest and sees the new territory in terms of energy resources and transportation infrastructure .

Further , the voters should respect the fact that legislators are national level representatives , and must be responsible to the people of the whole nation , and not ask their legislators to waste their money and energy going to local social gatherings or attending weddings and funerals and the like [ as local officials routinely do ] , nor select legislators on the basis of localism or the narrow concerns of some special interest group . This is the only way to give legislators more room to attend to the policy process .

In 1989 the Wildlife Conservation Law was passed . Besides being concerned about Taiwan 's image , the Council of Agriculture , which is responsible for ecological preservation work , is even more worried that the mountains are being scarred by ever-larger development projects , which are destroying the habitat of wild animals . It is feared that this destruction of habitat , combined with the Chinese belief that monkey brain is especially fortifying in the winter , will make the Formosan Rock Monkey an endangered species .  
He offers the analogy that inviting foreign investment is like " borrowing a hen to lay eggs . " The country is still responsible for providing the twigs and making the nest .

Thus prepared crab specimens generally look as if they have been boiled .

Chiueh Tzi-hong is confident that future astronomy programs will naturally come to generate more " added value . " He quotes the example of the participation of the Academia Sinica 's Institute of Physics in the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) program led by ethnic Chinese Nobel laureate Professor Samuel Ting . The AMS instrument , which is designed to detect antimatter cosmic rays in space , will fly on the International Space Station , and Taiwan is responsible for manufacturing some of the electronic circuitry .

Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
The Commission 's new approach to the problem of deciding before which organ and on what legal basis a State could be accused of an international crime seemed reasonable , but the trouble with the choice of the Security Council and the General Assembly as the organs responsible for characterization of an international crime was that , as in the past , they might take a complaisant attitude towards extremely serious wrongful acts , and moreover their competence was limited by the Charter . 
" Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,

Despite the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in his previous reports , insufficient publicity is still given to laws and governmental acts , to such an extent that they are unknown not only to the general public , but also to sectors of the public administration _ especially the peripheral authorities responsible for public order , who take advantage of their ignorance to deny legally granted rights to applicants .  
This was done solely in pursuit of internal and external political objectives : to prove that the international community _ NGOs and intergovernmental organizations , all alike _ is involved in attacking Zaire ; that it supports the Government of Rwanda ; and that Zaire is not responsible for the arms trafficking in the refugee camps of which the Security Council accuses it .  
Moreover , mention should be made of two key issues which have a decisive influence on the human rights situation in Guatemala : the values , attitudes and social behaviours that go to create the overall context in human rights violations take place and are encouraged and tolerant ; and the main characteristics of the functioning of the State institutions responsible for protecting human rights .

Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc . 
I would point out that the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus contains a large part of the island 's archaeological and historic sites , as well as religious monuments , which are subject to severe and extensive destruction , of which Turkey , as the occupying Power , is fully responsible and accountable .  
The incumbent would also be responsible for the collection and analysis of studies on peacekeeping operations prepared by national , research and academic institutions , as well as the planning and organization of lessons learned seminars or workshops , consultations with external experts and visits of lessons learned teams to the field .  
Attempts by the authorities to check the existence of these sacred sites have so far proved ineffective as a result of the shortcomings and loopholes in the laws governing the case , because some of the information held by a restricted number of women is secret and also because the information which is available can only be given to other women , which would imply that the rapporteur of the commissions of inquiry and the Minister responsible for Aboriginals to whom the report is to be submitted should be women .

Further , the voters should respect the fact that legislators are national level representatives , and must be responsible to the people of the whole nation , and not ask their legislators to waste their money and energy going to local social gatherings or attending weddings and funerals and the like [ as local officials routinely do ] , nor select legislators on the basis of localism or the narrow concerns of some special interest group . This is the only way to give legislators more room to attend to the policy process .

Steve Chao , deputy director of the Visual Information Technology Division at the CCRL , who has been responsible for laying the groundwork for this alliance , notes that HDTV will be the main-stream of global visual technology in the future . The key relevant technologies include high speed digital signal handling spun off from computer technology , high resolution imaging , and so on ; this will be a major revolution in the visual industry .  
In 1989 the Wildlife Conservation Law was passed . Besides being concerned about Taiwan 's image , the Council of Agriculture , which is responsible for ecological preservation work , is even more worried that the mountains are being scarred by ever-larger development projects , which are destroying the habitat of wild animals . It is feared that this destruction of habitat , combined with the Chinese belief that monkey brain is especially fortifying in the winter , will make the Formosan Rock Monkey an endangered species .  
He offers the analogy that inviting foreign investment is like " borrowing a hen to lay eggs . " The country is still responsible for providing the twigs and making the nest .

They have even been viewed as opportunistic and money hungry .  
Lots of people listen to the weather report every day , but you probably did n't know that the Central Weather Bureau operates an astronomical observatory which is not devoted to predicting the weather . It is responsible for calculating the precise timing of the 24 Solar Terms of the Chinese calendar every year . And after examining the data , the Ministry of the Interior includes it in the annual farmer 's almanac , distributed every year to each agricultural worker .  
For example , the public is allowed to walk through the Po Ai district , but mindful of being watched , everyone 's mood naturally grows more solemn upon entering it .

By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red .

Wang Yi-ju , the National Taiwan Normal University Institute of Environmental Education , who chose stray dogs as the subject for her master 's thesis , notes that none of Taiwan 's elementary school text books mention how to care for dogs , with the exception of a single essay by the writer Lin Liang on the warm feelings between him and his pet .

Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts .

Michael Chen of the Government Information Office was one of the key persons responsible for taking care of all the incoming foreign media .

The company was to be headed by Rojas , the stock to be floated on the Mexican market . The Mexican City market was to be its base , chiefly responsible for financial and legal services . Miami was to be the operational and transport hub , responsible for sales , technical assistance , product planning , dispersal , warehousing , and so on .  
ROC naval planning assumes that the PRC is the most likely enemy . Considering Taiwan 's defensive strategy and the limits on the tolerable defense budget burden , the ROC is aiming for a force that will be " small in numbers but high in quality . " The maritime component of such a force must be able to deal with threats from the air or from the surface or sub-surface of the ocean ; it is also responsible for maintaining a credible amphibious capability .  
The reason for the change in their itinerary was that , like every other previous foreign excursion by top-ranking officials of the ROC , Vice President Lien 's trip was met the entire way with pressure from Beijing . Firstly , after the senior officials of the ROC and Iceland met , PRC foreign affairs spokesman Shen Guofang issued a strongly worded criticism . He asserted that Prime Minister Oddson was interfering in " the internal affairs of China " and damaging relations between the PRC and Iceland , and that Iceland would be responsible for the consequences .  
For the Rukai , living at the foot of the mountains , land belonged to the tribal chief , who was responsible for looking after the old and weak .

The right brain , on the other hand , seems to be involved with images , imagination and intuition .  
As early as 1975 , brain specialists had discovered that the cerebral cortex , unique to primates , was responsible for intellectual activities such as language and reasoning .

On the lowest level lies the brain stem , sometimes called the reptilian brain .  
FPG moved quickly to clarify the situation , and later stated that there had indeed been deficiencies in the selection of the company to which it had contracted disposal of the waste . It also assumed responsibility for shipping the waste back to Taiwan , where it is now stored on a temporary site near Kaohsiung harbor . But despite these actions , FPG 's image as a pragmatic and responsible company has been severely tarnished .

In the three to four centuries since natural history museums were first established , there were no significant advances in the preparation of crustacean specimens . The pigments responsible for crabs ' coloration are not very stable , and the preservatives usually used have a corrosive effect . Thus prepared crab specimens generally look as if they have been boiled .  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China .

Chiueh Tzi-hong is confident that future astronomy programs will naturally come to generate more " added value . " He quotes the example of the participation of the Academia Sinica 's Institute of Physics in the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) program led by ethnic Chinese Nobel laureate Professor Samuel Ting . The AMS instrument , which is designed to detect antimatter cosmic rays in space , will fly on the International Space Station , and Taiwan is responsible for manufacturing some of the electronic circuitry .  
Tunghai University 's architecture team , the group responsible for the design , after discussing with structural engineers utilized a " sandwich " technique to build the walls .

The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services .

Such services must be adapted to specific socio-cultural contexts ; be extended to poor women , minorities , unmarried women and adolescents ; promote healthy and responsible reproductive behaviour ; pay special attention to young adults and men ; and promote the use of condoms and other barrier methods of contraception .  
Efforts to involve men as responsible partners in helping to satisfy such needs take on a special urgency given the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS and the potential improvement in reproductive health that would follow if programmes promoted male participation as well as male methods as part of the contraceptive choices available to couples .

But when the time comes to negotiate multilateral replenishments , additional multilateral resources are seen as coming at the expense of already stretched bilateral programmes , which are usually perceived to bring political benefits or to respond more closely to donor Government policies and priorities , since the donor itself is responsible for their supervision and control .

This was done solely in pursuit of internal and external political objectives : to prove that the international community _ NGOs and intergovernmental organizations , all alike _ is involved in attacking Zaire ; that it supports the Government of Rwanda ; and that Zaire is not responsible for the arms trafficking in the refugee camps of which the Security Council accuses it .  
Moreover , mention should be made of two key issues which have a decisive influence on the human rights situation in Guatemala : the values , attitudes and social behaviours that go to create the overall context in human rights violations take place and are encouraged and tolerant ; and the main characteristics of the functioning of the State institutions responsible for protecting human rights .

The general basis for securing sustainable development is the presence of adequate institutions , knowledge , skills and access to technology and financial resources , which will need to converge in the design and demonstration of sustainable - that is , responsible in a long-term perspective - ways of managing the environment , producing goods and services , meeting basic needs , and improving the economic and social standards of living for the world as a whole , especially for the poorest communities .

As a result of this initiative by Ethiopia , leaders of 26 Somali political organizations were able to meet for a high-level consultation in Sodere , Ethiopia , and after eight weeks of intensive , frank and responsible negotiations , agreed on a common course of action to resolve the crisis in their country and to put an end to the misery and suffering of their people .  
Since the beginning of the 1970s , intensive bilateral links have been forged with the parties responsible for the laying of the mines and leaving of remnants of war on Libyan territory ( Italy , Germany and the United Kingdom ) in order to gain detailed information on and maps of the minefields and the types of mines , and to provide technical assistance in locating and disarming the mat ï¿½ï¿½ iel and decontaminating the affected areas .  
When the Organization had assumed the responsibility of establishing the Tribunal , it had also assumed the responsibility of ensuring that it was able to operate effectively , bearing in mind the purpose of the Tribunal which was to bring to justice those individuals responsible for genocide and other systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda .  
In paragraphs 39 and 40 of its resolution 50 / 120 , the General Assembly reiterated the resident coordinator 's level of responsibility and authority , making him / her responsible for facilitating the coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences at the country level , and requesting that the resident coordinator be informed of planned programme activities of the United Nations system organizations at an early stage of formulation .

Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc . 
I would point out that the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus contains a large part of the island 's archaeological and historic sites , as well as religious monuments , which are subject to severe and extensive destruction , of which Turkey , as the occupying Power , is fully responsible and accountable .  
The incumbent would also be responsible for the collection and analysis of studies on peacekeeping operations prepared by national , research and academic institutions , as well as the planning and organization of lessons learned seminars or workshops , consultations with external experts and visits of lessons learned teams to the field .  
Attempts by the authorities to check the existence of these sacred sites have so far proved ineffective as a result of the shortcomings and loopholes in the laws governing the case , because some of the information held by a restricted number of women is secret and also because the information which is available can only be given to other women , which would imply that the rapporteur of the commissions of inquiry and the Minister responsible for Aboriginals to whom the report is to be submitted should be women .  
Whereas the date of 27 July 1997 had been accepted by the Congolese political community as a whole , represented within the National Commission responsible for the special administrative census , and by the prospective candidates in the presidential elections , in a solemn commitment signed on 31 May 1997 under the auspices of the Director-General of UNESCO , Mr .

Similarly , although the Civil Service Regulations make no distinction between the salaries , working hours and period of employment of male and female workers , they fail to provide adequate support for working women , particularly since the pension payable to a woman is not inherited by her family in the event of her death .  Moreover , the social security and health insurance of a working woman do not include her husband and children unless it is confirmed that they are in need and proven that the female employee is directly responsible for their maintenance .
